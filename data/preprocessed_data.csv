we understand that most people who reply immediately to an op with an invitation to talk privately mean only to help but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster it usually works out quite differently here than when you say pm me anytime in a casual social context we have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves were hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here this is just a small start our new wiki page explains in detail why its much better to respond in public comments at least until youve gotten to know someone it will be maintained at rdepressionwikiprivatecontact and the full text of the current version is below summary anyone who while acting as a helper invites or accepts private contact ie pms chat or any kind of offsite communication early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement either way its unwise to trust them pm me anytime seems like a kind and generous offer and it might be perfectly wellmeaning but unless and until a solid rapport has been established its just not a wise idea here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately by posting supportive replies publicly youll help more people than just the op if your responses are of good quality youll educate and inspire other helpers the rulehttpsenwikipediaorgwikiruleinternetculture applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet people who are struggling with serious mentalhealth issues often justifiably have a low tolerance for disappointment and a highlevel of everchanging emotional need unless the helper is able to make a commitment to be there for them in every way for as long as necessary offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good this is why mentalhealth crisisline responders usually dont give their names and callers arent allowed to request specific responders its much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole analogously its much safer and healthier for our ops to develop a relationship with the community as a whole even trained responders are generally not allowed to work highintensity situations alone its partly about availability but its mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue if a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mentalhealth issues including suicidality which is often comorbid with depression escalate in a pm conversation its much harder for others including the rdepression and rsuicidewatch moderators to help contrary to common assumptions moderators cant see or police pms in our observation over many years the people who say pm me the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mentalhealth issues and mentalhealth support we all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively community input mitigates these limitations theres no reason why someone whos truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny if helpers are concerned about their own privacy keep in mind that selfdisclosure when used supportively is more about the feelings than the details and that we have no problem here with the use of altthrowaway accounts and have no restrictions on account age or karma we all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others these people do want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims there are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mentalhealth issues if a helper invites an op to talk privately and gives them a good supportive experience theyve primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers this sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someones in a state of mentalhealth crisis when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning if ops want to talk privately posting on a wideopen anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option although we dont recommend it we do allow ops to request private contact when asking for support if you want to do this please keep your expectations realistic and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to pm before opening up to them,1
anyone else just miss physical touch i crave it so badly,1
im just so ashamed everyone and everything feels so far away every time i leave my house i feel like im drowning in an ocean while watching people on the shore having a grand old time i feel like everyone else is on a whole other plane of existence meanwhile im stuck beneath the surface just trying to breathe every time i talk to someone i have to check to see if theres something on my face once i leave because other people dont know what to say to me and its always so fucking awkward i try so hard to appear normal but other people see right through it i cant relate to anyone i cant talk to anyone i try so hard but i just cant and its embarrassing i feel stupid for being this way ive tried so hard to fix myself and i dont know what im doing wrong ive been in therapy for over a decade and the only thing thats changed is im really good at talking about myself,1
i really need a friend i dont even have a single best friend and im desperate to find true love please help me no one responded to my last post it seems like no one cares about me and my life doesnt matter female here just saying,1
hear me out life in general sucks we have to work the majority of our time in jobs we hate for people we dont care about to earn just about enough to live relatively comfortably the majority of people are selfish assholes who only care about themselves me you and of people included whether we admit it or not to me optimistic people seem mentally ill i dint see the appeal in pretending that were not all fucking miserable also if i hear one more person talk about manifesting happiness i may be doing to life tldr if a movie sucks you would turn it off,1
never in a million years did i think id be on reddit writing something like this but maybe this is my soul trying to find some sort of salvation from the pain ive been thrown into the proverbial fire as of late amp i feel like im just unable to get a grip on anything my father passed away amp i hadnt spoken to him in well over yrs prior to his passing he was extremely abusive to me as a child to the point or making me bleed i am not really sad about his passing but feel many of the what if things in relation to a better childhood i found out that my sister is not my sister amp we dont have the same father amp we both have been lied to about that our entire lives by our mother who i also dont have the best relationship with we did dna tests two days ago for absolute concrete evidence of everything so now its a waiting game i live in the same house as her amp have been dying to get out on my own but financially am unable to at the moment due to my own disability cystic fibrosis the girl i have been in a situationship doesnt feel the same way i do about her this one hurts me so much honestly more in a sense than my dad passing i feel like im mourning the loss of someone still alive but we are still friends amp love one another i never thought id catch feelings for her but here we are we have a beautiful friendship the sex is great amp we have so many great laughs amp moments shes been such a bright spot in my dark times lately i wanted to see if we could give things a real try but she just doesnt feel how i do this now is breaking my heart amp dont know how to navigate it i dont want to just get rid of her as a friend i genuinely care about her she is fine with continuing what we are doing but im not sure i can do that right now with how i feel about her everything is just compounding ontop of eachother amp i feel like im suffocating my appetite is shot i feel restless where i feel like im going crazy amp ive been having very dark thoughts amp find humor in self harm jokes to myself amp my close friends maybe this is a cry for help maybe im trying im not sure but if anyone reads this amp has advice or a heart to be here for me i would love amp cherish your kindness thank you,1
hi i want to preface by saying im sorry because i know this is completely and totally selfish of me to ask theres a million things i want to say or express but i feel like i can only do it with someone who understands or at the very least someone who isnt directly involved im sorry i dont want to be a burden but thats what im asking i think if theres any chance some lovely amazing person would let me burden them just for a bit i would appreciate it with my whole heart or whatever is left of it aha,1
im m and ive always maintained that im too ugly for women and that hasnt changed then my not long ago my therapist talked me into using a dating app to get experience to chatting with women and to get over fears of rejection i didnt like the idea but i did it anyway well i think it is fair to say that it was the final straw because the only women who were allegedly interested were women in foreign countries sure they were highly educated they claimed and quite a few of them were not bad looking but i zero matches from us women long story short i was talking to this female doctor in the dominican republic and most of our conversations had to be done with google translate because she didnt speak much english well after a while i realized that this was going nowhere and i politely told her that we needed to go our separate ways and unmatched her a few days later i decided that enough was enough i think its beyond reasonable doubt that im too ugly and need to just embrace being alone for life but my brain wont let me i keep having to remind myself to not go back to the app to just find ways to help people and be content alone but again my mind keeps obsessing about being alone so that i find myself needing to vent several times a day and its pathetic i have proof that im hopelessly ugly among other things and need to just stop thinking about it and embrace being alone and stop caring i dont want to care anymore i want to happy and content with my life,1
i used to get through my life by believing in the delusion that things were all going to work out one day and id find my place in the world now i realize that all ive accomplished through this is to prolong my suffering every day of my life is pain and misery and nothing else and it will always be that way i cannot fucking believe that this is what life is but i guess i just got unlucky some people get to have loving parents close friends romantic partners and a career they enjoy that makes them enough money to live on and some of us get none of those things we get left to rot in shitty minimumwage jobs ignored by all the girls or boys in school treated like shit by everyone who was supposed to care about us we get nothing and yet were expected to be grateful for a life empty of everything that makes it worth living so i think im done with all of this nonsense i havent planned my way out yet but i think this is where my story is going to end i cant imagine a future where im happy and i wont bother trying anymore,1
i can never truly believe someone when they say something positive about me i feel like shit for not believing them but i just cant i always think they are just fucking with me and they dont actually mean it because come on nobody would sincerely say that type of bullshit about me i dont like thjs,1
im a year old man whos never had a girlfriend or sex in his life and since yesterday i decided to give up trying i have a very good life amazing family and friends that understand and support me no matter what i do i have a job that i enjoy and coworkers i get extremely well along with i dont consider myself ugly i think im just mid i nurture many passions am very extroverted and outgoing and i believe im quite smart but especially in these last years ive been feeling extremely hollow and sad and the reason why is no matter what i do or how much i keep improving myself i seem to have no luck with girls yesterday i went out with this great girl i met in university years ago which ive been texting on and off with i thought she had interests in me since she was the one asking me out but as i later found out in the day she had been seeing this guy for about a month where she is studying i promised myself to go into that date with no expectations but of course there was hope things would go well however as per usual i had to go back home and cry myself to sleep for the th time and im just tired of this endless repeating cycle people whove had at least one relationship in their life will never get the pain,1
m i feel like im slowly decaying my mind slips i cant remember much anymore i have no desire to do any fun activities anymore at least not the ones that ive done already which is just about everything i have all the desire in the world to get better but no motivation i can honestly feel myself getting worse each month i noticed that i become a little more sad and unmotivated over time and i really cant seem to stop it from progressing it feels like a disease my life just feels like im in limbo every day i wake up do the same thing all day that ive done a million times this week then wait until my insomnia decides to let me sleep at night i get into depressive episodes that lead to panic attacks which fill my head with intrusive thoughts that i would never think normally its nothing horrifying or disturbing but they really bother me its like the voice in my head wants me to be sad on purpose the thought that really bugs me the most the reason for making this post in the first place tells me to push people away not really in that exact manner but i question if i can really feel anything towards the people who are close to me everyone is normally completely fine but not during my episode it makes me feel like a completely different person it makes me wonder if i really love my girlfriend and if id be better off alone its similar for my friends im fine with them normally but during my episodes they annoy me and i feel like i want to stop talking to them but after i go to sleep and wake up everything is back to normal i love my girlfriend and i like my friends this thought didnt start happening until this month i never used to want to push people away because ive always been the lonely type who wants more friends and i always hated being alone and i still do which is how i can tell that im getting worse im just not me anymore im a completely different person than the one i used to know the other thoughts are just pessimistic jabs at my future and general sadness questions wondering if im ever going to live a stable life or if im going to feel happy and content ever again or if i will continue to be a failure forever i always have to remind myself that it has to get better eventually and i cant feel like this forever but most times its hard to convince myself i cant remember the last time i didnt feel terrible im not suicidal i dont have a desire to stop living and dont even get thoughts about it whatsoever but these episodes make it really difficult to be a living functioning person i need to know how to stop thinking this way when i start to feel hopeless i know i probably need a therapist or psychiatrist to help me professionally but im afraid of them,1

im right now and i graduated from college in the fall with a bachelors degree in psychology and after realizing i wasnt going to do much with that degree as ive completely lost interest in that field since i have been working as a parttime student advisor making less than k annually as i was very undecided about the direction my life was going to go and it was like this for years until i decided to return to college to take prerequisite courses for graduate school so that i can get into a data science graduate program im currently in my program right now and i have been keeping a gpa and this gives me a lot of hope but ive noticed that some of my friends including my love interest make much more money than i do and have their own places my love interest told me that i will eventually get out of my situation and we still had very passionate sex when i last visited him and we exchanged our gratitudes for each but its like im very disappointed at myself for allowing myself to be where i am today if i had known from the beginning just how much my socioeconomic status would affect my prospective friendshipsrelationships i would have taken things more seriously and considered a field that was more lucrative when i was an undergrad,1
my doctor is talking about a counsellor referral and meds ssris i dont want to take meds im scared of the side effects and such especially when stuff like weight gain and low libido are super common side effects i know if i experience that i will become so much worse because i have experienced that can i be better with just counselling or will i need medicine im sorry if this is silly i dont know anyone whos on them i have no one to turn to,1
i used to hurt myself with a purpose but now i do it just because wondering if one day ill be able to bring it to a point of no return because i feel so pathetic for hurting myself without a purpose atleast if i try to commit suicide theirs a purposw but for some reason i dont wanna die but i do and its so hard to explain i either care to much or not at all im so angry all the time its like the moment i feel anything negative ir turns into anger and i hurt everyone around me and the worst thing about it is i have a small circle of people that care and i wish they didnt so it was easier to live with the way i feel i dont have any friends though but i ruined those friendsships somedays i care and somedays i dont but i dont have anyone to talk to so thats why im writing here and im not sure what im looking for by doing this so what is the point really i dont know,1
im not depressed i dont think i just have some really big problems going on and i hate my life so much i really want to die but i dont want to feel pain or anything cos that would suck so i was thinking would a lethal overdose on some sort of drug be painless or would it hurt,1
i feel so empty and i just dont know where to turn now,1
its like you feel like youre doing things but then anytime anything doesnt work how it should it creates internal chaos with way of processing without a breakdown or maybe its just me,1
im trying so hard to better myself and not feel so fucking depressed but its hard when it feels like you have no support and nobody seems to understand its hard enough having a fucked up mental but now you add everything else going on and it feels like a lot of things are just so insignificant,1
im constantly battling with myself day after day im kinda get sick of beating myself up over not being good enough for me im working hard but i dont feel like im working hard enough on myself even the way i feel like i need to ive gotten off my meds but sometimes it feels like a relapse its made my taste in music change things i used to love i dont enjoy anymore friends i dont really connect with many anymore even the people i used to see i dont see any more my connections seem to be gone the constants in my life there is maybe of my job my family my friends and where i live emotionally im not well physically im doing better so one thing at a time i guess fighting with myself i dont want to do it constantly,1
i just dont really care anymore i guess i just hope i get some brain injury so that it causes memory loss or something a long those lines dying doesnt sound so bad either honestly but forgetting would be way better then i could function again and be happy hopefully,1
my friends are telling me to travel or do fun things while i hear back from the jobs ive applied to but how can i im anxious about not having a paycheck i have no drive to do anything other than apply to jobs i have all this free time now and even when i cant focus on job applications im too depressed to do anything i would actually enjoy well i still enjoy doing yoga so not all is bleak but thats pretty much all i have the energy to do ive lost all the creativity and passion i used to have for making art and my friends are all still working full time so i dont really have anyone to hang out with until they get out of work i know im going to regret this time once im back to working full time and having limited time off but i dont know how to experience joy right now,1

im in a certain blood set and most of my friends are in jail i myself was thinking of going to jail too i dont value myself i joined the set because i was protecting someone close to me from another gang because they threatened to hurt them im going to accept the consequences if i carry out the mission on my own but it does suck my best friends are gone possibly forever my day ones i still have a couple around but its not the same you know no female can replace a bond between my friend group they were my niggas lol but yeah im only and kinda willing to throw my life away already my heart feels so cold everyday from drug addiction to doing shit in the streets from being abandoned at a young age to being homeless with my family from people always looking down on me and the darkness i surrounded myself with i despise humans besides my best friends and my family i hate people im ready to go i really dont care if i live or die its crazy because even my therapist told me at a young age id be a threat to society anyways id be afraid to admit she was right materialistic things dont matter to me i feel as if almost my only purpose is living for my gang i dont feel happy ever i just hate everyone and everything im ready to go i miss my friends goodbye,1

how painful is it and what are the chances of dying from it,1
when i dont exercise regularly my mental health takes a nose dive when i dont push myself to go into social settings and interact with others especially friends semiregularly my mental health takes a nose dive when i dont push myself to switch up my routine it happens and it happens when i have no routine it happens when i dont get enough sleep when i dont spend enough time outside and the list goes on its exhausting and while a lot of these habitsthings are enjoyable in the moment once i push past my but i dont wanna inner toddler brain im so sick of having to do so much all the time just to maintain okayand truth be told lately i havent life has been unnecessarily shitty and ive had to make so many decisions and compromises on big things like my job and living situation that i crumpled and i know working out would make a much bigger difference to my mood right now than writing this post but im sick of everything why does life insist on being such a shit show update after writing this briefly texting with a redditor who was kind enough to reach out to ask if im okay and feeling my feelings for a bit aka crying i put on my workout clothes and got it over with it didnt do much right then and there but i also went to bed on time to get a proper nights rest and i woke up feeling a little better so up and onwards i go until the next time i veer off track managing myself because there really isnt an alternative i know how low i get when i throw in the towel and dont pick it back up again quickly enough,1
hows anyone else make riding out their depression spells easier outside of meds therapy and other medical treatments just day to day esp when any energy you may have had is long since gone and in that fun start of numbness,1
i am a med student who is struggling a lot with anxiety and depression i havent went to a therapist yet but i am planning to soon however i am feeling guilt that maybe instead i should spend more time on studying or find ways to improve my academic performance because its not well and is partially the reason i am depressed anyways in conclusion i am wondering should i first deal with my mental health or my academics i have also been suicidal thats probably important to mention,1
i dated someone for over years of my life my entire s i never loved anyone more we had a falling out our relationship became toxic and even as we tried to remain friends it didnt work i cut her off last year at end of januarybeginning of february i assumed she had moved on and everything and stopped talking to me insteadshe died i suspect she took her own life no one told me for months i held resentment towards her i didnt want to be with her but i was upset that she had made our relationship toxic instead she was dead her family did not tell me on tuesday her mother called me to tell me the news months later i am devastated she did not deserve to die i am so fucking angry at myself i knew she was sick i knew she was suicidal and i cut her off anyway im angry at her family for denying me the ability to see her funeral im angry that everyone else got a year to grief together and i am dealing with this loss alone i didnt message her for an entire year because i was convinced she found someone else and my pride wouldnt allow me to even say hi hope all is well i feel horrendous,1
so like the title says my boyfriend has depression he already suffered from this even before we met so i knew what i was getting myself into but i did not care because he seemed so willing to be open to communicate or at least try his best and give me as much as he could happy as much as you can be happy in a depression to be with me and most of all he showed me so much love months have gone by since we became official and his depression has been getting worse i dont care i want to be there for him all the way through everything i love him i would do so much for him and i do but i would do basically anything for him but i have felt him getting less open and he doesnt communicate his thoughts and feelings at all anymore whenever something is bothering him or whenever he is feeling bad i notice i can just tell but then when i ask him whats is going on he always says nothing and then continues to show behaviour that clearly shows he is feeling some type of way whenever i do push through to have a conversation with him he gets really quiet and doesnt answer most of my questions and if he does it is usually a onewordanswer he isnt happy about anything anymore not even about me i think there used to be a time where he made me feel special wanted loved now he gets annoyed or even mad if i say or do anything wrong when all i want to do is help him i am distraught i love him more than anything i can not handle the heartbreak it would give me to lose him we are so far in together we had have plans for the future but without him actively showing me love and trying to communicate i just feel like i am giving him so much of myself but not getting enough back he says he has no time to work on everything granted he has his education and work which is already tiring for him especially living with depression an anxiety disorder and an ed i guess the conclusion is that he has no room for this relationship anymore but due to me being selfish i cant bring myself to break up with him,1
hello all thank you for taking the time to listen i recreantly have been on a weight loss journey and have lost roughly pounds in months i did this by exercising for a few hours a day and being careful of what i eat or drink these last two weeks though i have been bingeing and eating like there is no tomorrow an adventure that is driving me insane and honestly depressed i still work out and such during the daytime i am happy and on cloud the feeling that anything is possible and the world is my oyster at night though i get depressed and always have these cravings for sugary food even though i do not want the food i end up indulging i hate myself for doing this i do not want to go back to being overweight moreso than i currently am does someone have any tips or suggestions for my conundrum,1
the results not a damn thing changed they asked listened to the response and left that question means literally nothing lmao,1
both depression and mental exhaustion or burnout share a lot of the same things no energy to do things bad sleep not in the mood to do things a very bad memory and not able to remember things not being capable of having fun because you feel so tired you want to do things but are just not able to do so cause you feel so crappy getting angry or irritated at everything and everyone how did you know that you wereare depressed and not just mentally exhausted or burned out i learned that a depressed person might still want to do things but feel so tired and dont enjoy the things they wanna do or used to enjoy i had some kind of medical form with a lot of questions and the result is that i have a very high score on distress and depression but depression can cause high distress symptoms and high distress can cause depression symptoms anyone who can share some information ps they claim i am clinically depressed for a few years now but i dont wanna die i also dont care if i live or die if i die then so be it,1
i dont deserve to transfer colleges i have a scholarship at my current institution and its politically more healthy and accepting than the one i want to go to the one where im transferring to isnt as good but i have a friend group and were very warm the politics of some members bother me though i dont deserve this i have a scholarship ffs at my institution whats driving me away is the imminent threat of violence should i speak up about the abuse i endured at the church i grew up in which also has a branch at my university i wanna die either high out of state costs with less accepting people but very warm and tight knit friends nonetheless or in state with more accepting environment but no friends and a gun on the back of my head in the mirage of acceptance and environment,1
i know it just comes with trauma that i have no idea how to compact and i feel so behind i live at home with my mom because of student loans from a degree i had to drop out of because her credit score wasnt good enough and neither was mine i now sit with k in student debt and only k would be gone if biden finally wipes away student debt my mom right now has been more anxiety inducing than before i get it im overweight i have mental health issues need some sun and a better job but it doesnt help when she berates and complains about it daily and comparing me to others i barely eat as it is and while she serves unhealthy food as well she gets mad that im not eating healthy and moving like a fucking swan im like lbs full of anxiety different kinds of odd combinations of grass and veggies in some green smoothies that tastes like eating someones ass that hasnt showered for years still gets mad that i eat unhealthy when she makes it and its literally all we have she gets mad that i dont spend time with her at all and prefer to hang out with my friends that are online she tells me i look ugly and i should look better in clothes that look ugly on me as it is literally she treats me just like my older brother did minus the sexual abuse i endured for fucking years which ended when i was by leaving to art school and finally having a way to make it end by severing ties with him well he did it with me being yelled at because i get anxious or depressed isnt a way to help someone unpack trauma nor help them get motivated about doing better its gotten so bad i cant focus on anything very well i dont even have privacy to go and study to be a data analyst in coursera because school is really expensive nowadays and i dont have the time to be able to go i feel really stuck and i know many people are gonna say its procrastination and i get it might be but it stems from an overflowing and everchanging amounts of anxiety and depression that has never stopped i cant afford therapy because that shit isnt covered nor can i drive to one because i dont have a car nor do i have the money to pay for an uber drive weekly along with whatever fee therapy comes withbi also never have privacy so i cant do at home therapy i have so little privacy my mom barges in and tries to talk to me even though i tell her im in a literal meeting but if i try to set boundaries or do things myself im called an asshole its so much thrown at me i feel like i just freeze and just sit and do nothing because thats better than sitting with her and possibly be yelled and berated at for my weight for the umpth time even though shes heavy and diabetic herself yeah my live sucks right now,1
i do it all the time when im around people obviously but sometimes i catch myself smiling when im all alone and when i think about how im feeling im neutral at best so why tf am i smiling anyone else experienced this can anyone tell me why,1
i dread when the sun goes down because im officially all alone without anyone to keep me company to keep me out of my head normally i sleep pretty well despite it all i get to bed pretty okay but for the last week super vivid dreams have been causing me to wake up anxious and feeling like i barely slept and what do i do to stop it just sleep more i havent woke up before in the evening for the last week i just dont know what to do anymore when i am up if no one is around or im not on the phone with someone i just cry i cry and dwell on how crappy everything is right now then i progress to berating myself for throwing pity parties all the time or how hateful im starting to get with others in my sheer exhaustion im sick of this i just want it to stop,1
this might sound like an exaggeration but im being dead serious when i say i have not felt properly awake in months and its awful i dont know why i feel this way but its majorly impacting my life i usually sleep for hours a day and those other hours are just me forcing myself to stay awake until i physically cant anymore ive tried everything i started working out and have lost pounds since the year started and i still dont feel energized i had to switch to online school due to several factors but one of them was my inability to make it through the school day because i was just so tired that i couldnt function i drink dangerous amounts of caffeine on the daily but even that doesnt help i dont know what to do but feeling this way just makes me extremely suicidal being awake is painful,1
so i f became friends with this guy m about a year ago we get along well and talk mostly everyday of course there are days when hes not really active and vise versa and i completely understand that in the past hes voiced not wanting to be alive and it worried me but his mood seemed to lift afterwards well recently he started venting about life and told me hes contemplating killing himself his moms sick hes the only one supporting his family financially and hes a single dad i tried to do my best to listen and let him know im there for him but im still worried about him i dont feel like anything im doing is enough so i guess my question is how can i best help my friend,1
does anyone that currently hasnt had a job ever feel like they are useless i graduated from university in maybe it was covid messed up my sense of time to get a bachelors degree in culture literature and the arts but i am stuggling really hard to find a job i dont necessarily need a job in that specific profession but i do want a job that will at least make life manageable so i can eventually get my own place and move out of my parents basement ive worked a temp job at my old university but never had a real job where they wouldnt get rid of me after a couple of months right now i havent been able to find a good job that my parents will accept and i feel like it is tearing me apart on the inside watching my friends and siblings move on in their lives while im struggling so far behind them i honestly dont know what to do ive cried about this before on many occasions it feels like my anxiety issues crush the soul out of me that i struggle everyday to get out of bed has anybody else dealt with this how did you overcome it,1
how can i help alleviate all of this depression im going through its hard for me to leave the house or do the things i love without someone taking me and getting me out also i keep putting it all on my partner and i can tell its a lot for them to see me like this everyday if anyone can help i would appreciate it im scared of how it may be ruining who i am as a person and sometimes i think it would be easier to just self sabotage or worse,1
ive been fighting with my mom often its taking a big toll on the both of us and ive recently started to think that she might be right about how i am selfish and horrible to her im so tired of things at this point and has thought of ending things multiple times telling her how i feel and think never is possible because i get so scared im such a bad person where i cant even respect my mom but also so useless as i get to scared to end things,1
i really hate myself so much like im basically the worst its impossible for me to even keep friends they always end up hating me like why cant i just be normal like everyone else my mind just spirals making me think about stuff i dont want to and making me more and more depressed which then ends up making people i talk to hate me which then makes everything even worse like whats even the point of my existence,1
im a failure all my high school friends graduated college and have a partner meanwhile im almost with no college degree still trying to finish college the person i fell in love with doesnt love me back theres more to it but i dont want to bother anyone by having to read such a long post i honestly think the only thing keeping me in this world is my dog i cry every night and i keep replaying all my failures and overthinking everything i dont know what to do,1
people think im rude i think im rude because i look so cold too but the fact is that im too depressed and anxious to manage my facial expressions and responses people think im weird i have sad adhd and several other disorders which make me weird i feel so misunderstood i have bpd i always feel like im abandoned by everyone around me that makes me super anxious and depressed im also anxious about many other silly things and it affects my daily life so badly i feel like a failure im really depressed i wish i could just disappear forever every day i just wish that i could never wake up again i wish i looked more like a normal person so people wont notice me and talk about me,1
my mind is killing me it switches up so fast and i dont understand why i want to be alone but cant stand it and my stress jus fucking kills me over the dumbest shit too i have no way to fix it either i drink and cut and jus cant stop sometimes i want it all to end,1
i dont deserve to be alive i swear to god im such a fuck up i fucked everything in my life up i wish i could just die,1
so at the current time in my reality i finished school around years ago and have been jobless since ive been living with my family the days have become dull and timewasting i feel like my time sleeping and dreaming is more fulfilling and lively for me than being awake when i wake up i turn on my computer and if im not doing something with my family ill sit for hours a day with breaks of making food and stuff everything has become obscurely pointless i feel like im wasting my life on temporary things a part of me just wants to stay in the dark and discover the vast illusion of suffering while the other part wants to start and become something grand i despise how society is built everything feels so complex and demanding many times again ive wished that the world was of a past era a downgrade if you will where economy complexity orderliness greed and money wasnt discovered anyways probably gonna feel better tomorrow,1
my mortality recently hit me for real and its been sending me into a deep depression everything feels utterly pointless because no matter how well i live ill die and not remember any of it there wont be any legacy of me since the universe itself will die in the end nothing has any point to it were just here to plug our ears and pretend that were never going to die despite also being certain of it my whole life just fell apart and now i can barely enjoy things knowing itll all be gone i keep mourning my friends and family knowing everything i do with them amounts to nothing no professional help or medication can change these things existence is just a prison where they dangle all these wonderful things in front of you and then remind you that youll be dead and none of it will have mattered theres no afterlife no legacy nothing this feels like the cruelest joke imaginable i have zero motivation to pursue a career knowing its all for nothing i can barely enjoy my hobbies knowing theyre just a distraction and wont be remembered by anyone,1
im f and my mom me and her never had the best relationship going ever since maybe a kid and even more now growing up it hurts that your mom and dad argue violently over the phone about their relationship and who doesnt want to keep me back and forth i would cover my ears and rock even growing up i was very very munched bullied told my mom and nothing would be done even told her as a year old i wanted to unalive ignored me even told her a lot of time growing up and i didnt have my dad alot due to him being on drugs and in and out of prison and my mom being upset about it losing her soulmate and going to my dad they have a very very rocky relationship and marriage and they couldve been better off divorced even one time she and him went all out on it changing locks separated even her leaving me with my little sister for weeks to see random men she just met but took each other back my mom has bully me about my weight even called me a hoe a bitch a disappointment and how much she wants me out of her house and everything hurts my feelings even calls my undiagnosed very much have it adhd a retard thing a problem and i have adhd and tells my dad about it like im such a retard she even threatened me many times to put me out a girl whos does everything she ask for went to school getting decent or good degrades first to grad high school soon college and in college to be a teacher but she wants to put me out and everything and not my year old brother who literally has nothing going for him and has the nerve to call him the better child even though they rarely get into he calls her out her name and she does too i never done that to her no matter how mad iam i dont know what i did wrong my heart hurts i seek attention from the wrong crowd from men from anybody just to be groomed to feel all sweet and happy in my heart and all i wanted is motherly love and a healthy relationship we do then something happens and im getting hurt naked called fat she and more my dad sometimes agree with her and even takes her side its rare when he takes my side hes even worse at times i have mental breakdowns from them and even cry myself to bed wanting a loving relationship with them even had a few work mothers who i enjoyed it fills a hole in my heart even because of them they call me the sweetest names and talk to me about my issues than her brushing it off even my dad calling me weak all because of this i gained age regression and find comfort from this at late nights or when im all very much alone,1
for the last three years ive experienced emotional detachment its been so long that i forgot i have it i have close to no emotional reactions to anything external the only way i can make myself cry is if im pretending to be sad i dont feel anything and it makes me think im crazy i dont act numb because i fake my emotions even when im alone i used to feel more but now when situations occur when emotions would most likely come out it doesnt even feel like its happening to me i could chop off all my hair and i would have no reaction my sister got engaged and i had to fake my reaction whenever i hear news its just like hearing words and thats all it doesnt feel like im emotionless per se it feels like im not even processing the situation in the first place logically i know its happening but i dont feel aware at all why is this is this depression am i a sociopath id also like to bring up that i have been diagnosed with ocd and i had a very emotionally abusive father at a very young age,1
i f have spent the last years of my life in a horrible depressive state despite this i have gone to university always been a people pleaser and maintained a fairly nice life i have a nice car my dream job and i have bought my own house i realise this seems so nice and its such a far cry from reality to say im struggling but honestly things couldnt be worse the job that was my dream feels so difficult all i do is work all week then spend my weekends drunk im trying to break this habit but its hard if it hadnt gone on so long i would think it was because of alcohol but because i have felt like this for so long i think i am just destined to feel this way i want to die but im too scared how do we go on living in this state of wanting to be the best we can but also wanting to fade away into nothing,1
i guess im a poly addict but rn its alcohol i just turned im wasting my life away drinking everyday no job i have one passion and its music but i dont see it going anywhere my gf is an alcoholic who blames me for her alcoholism she asked if she could punch me in the face tonight called me a loser cuz i said she needed help idk i guess im just venting but im so lost and i feel like no one cares my mom sends me a week so i wont bother her thats how i get my alcohol i feel like such a bum loser cant even hold down a job let alone show up to an interview its a cop out for sure but its because my anxiety i get anxiety everywhere im scared of shit like getting blown up everytime i stop to fill up on gas im scared of a gas line exploding at a food service place i cant even be outside with panic attacks that im gonna be struck by lightning i just need help and idk where to turn it feels like everyone hates me or is disappointed i feel like i wont be here much longer i cant deal with the anxiety or stress or apathy or anything i cant do it anymore i guess this is just a vent and im sorry if it breaks any rules but damn life is just weird and sad and i dont get it btw if that makes a difference,1
i was already having a pretty bad day today feeling depressed and feeling abandoned by people i care about i figured id at least find some comfort in food so i headed to my colleges dining hall buffet and grabbed a box to put some food in for takeout well i spotted one of the foods i really like hashbrown casserole but thats not really important and started grabbing myself a decent portion but with how layered thin it was to get a reasonable portion it would take more scoops because of the thinness well i guess one of the workers spotted how much was gone from me scooping n they made jokes with one saying gah damn when looking over at me and his work buddies laughed one of the others said dont worry about it were glad u enjoy it and i usually dont care about jokes like that but after the day i had that was the final straw i finished grabbing my food went to my room n broke down first time i had cried in months because i was getting better at managing but once everything starts piling up you never know what can be the gum wrapper that topples the pile,1
im having really bad intrusive thoughts well i assume they are intrusive maybe they are just my thoughts i want to hurt myself i want to kill myself i want to hurt someone else im trying to distract myself but im also making an excuse in my head to go out and act on these everything would be so much easier if i was dead i dont want to deal with this anymore,1
i do not know where to begin i found out my mom has stage lung cancer and we have a complicated relationship i love her but i do not like her as a person she was very controlling toxic and rough i know she had the best intentions for me but she used shame to inspire me to be what she wanted she helped to make me a people pleaser and obsessed with my weight i do not hate her i love her i hate that i am not the daughter she wanted she is trying to be kind now but it does not come naturally to her i try to visit my folks every months to help out as i am several states away i am very sad as when my folks pass they are both in their s i will not have any family of origin i get sad thinking about attending a funeral it is not sadness it is deeper i do not think i would be able to get on a plane i think about this as my mom has let me know that i have to i told her that i do not care what other people think that is a lie i do care deeply what others think i am crying right now it is more than my mom being sick i grew up being told i was fat and told that everyone was talking about me i know she just wanted a thin daughter and did not have the tools to tell me she would love me just as i am but was concerned about my health she would just use guilt and shame to make me feel bad i think she wanted to inspire me with these tactics she and my dad both had rough childhoods and did not know how to parent they sent me to good schools bought me everything i wanted and tried their best with the limited knowledge they had still crying and feeling hopeless i feel that my life has been so much to please them and i failed according to them they are both trying very hard to be loving now i did not receive hugs growing up and do now i am rambling i just am very sensitive i think my self esteem is so low that i do not know how to receive love now please tell me if you had a complex relationship with a parent and how you handled end of life issues how did you cope with a dying parent who made you feel like a failure how do you go on after being told how terrible you are why was she so rough why did it take her finding out she has cancer to hug me and tell me i look good why will i find happiness after she dies why do i hate myself why why why and thanks,1
its just so hard ive been trying to find a way to get better but i just cant my only goal lately has been to save money in order to move out of my parents house thats it i just work and sleep i miss being a kid,1
i feel terrible i dont care about life i dont want to care about it i dont want things to get better i just want out these feelings are becoming crippling at this point and im struggling to take care of myself kids or work i have no interest or motivation to do anything i am so very alone i dont wanna talk to other people anyway because im just bad energy and i hate to keep bringing that to people i care about i live because i have two daughters that i love but thats it i feel stuck and hate that i have obligations like work when i can barely stop crying all day,1
today psychiatrist prescribed me antidepressants after she asked if i would take them i said maybe but honestly i dont know if even want to get better because i to be completely fair lost any sense in living theres no worth in my presence on this world nonetheless she said that my mind is simply trapped in this pesimistic way of thinking and i have to believe it can and will get better using therapy and medication but at this time i do not want to ive had a strong suicidal episode recently im waiting for it to come back and drive me to an attempt seriously will these thoughts pass by or what i have a strong sense meds wont help with that and im scared if they would actually work ill probably start taking them tomorrow can anyone share a similar experience with not wanting to get better,1
i am now i had job good place to stay healthy bank balance everything one needs until covid hit i got this loud breathing condition which cant really be fixed i cant really perform in interviews due to this i lost my golden job in covid period since then i slowly accepted lower paying jobs everyone around me elevated to new heights in meantime i here i am broke and i have nothing left to lose my heath also has taken a hit if anyone got any online job opportunity please let me know nfnmvgmailcom here is my email or you can pm me please dont try to scam me i have nothing left to lose,1
i really hate myself i hate that when i get more depressed than usual i crave external validation its all i can do not to seek attention from people when i feel like shit i hate that i get strong crushes on people who show me genuine affection for a couple of days i hate that im incapable of putting effort into changing my life and myself i just want to be held and loved and i hyperfixate on new people who i think care about me i just want attention to make me feel better and i hate it,1
because its so obvious lets face it no one likes someone who isnt comfortable in their own skin its why people gravitate towards social enthusiastic people who love themselves these types of people are managers well respected individuals with families im bright capable yet im completely and utterly held back for the simple fact i hate myself no one wants anything to do with me you dont get a sympathy card in life either you love yourself and others will want to know you or no one gives a shit and you are a weird creepy quiet loser,1
i am unattractive ill admit it society doesnt view me as gorgeous or anything attractive society views black women as shrek monsters unless we straighten our hair or are visual mixed it makes me mad that ill never be considered pretty by the mass scale it always bothers me i want to leave this planet so bad or die i dont ever want to be looked at by anyone ever again,1
im reminded of my depression again with a heavy and hollow feeling in my chest its like someone is sitting on me pinning me down rendering me unable to do anything other than lay in bed i feel this much stronger when i have to be alone with my thoughts or if im tired these days i find that im always tired,1
its midnight i have to get up at asscrack early tomorrow i cant go to sleep because of how fucking anxious i am i feel like everyone fucking hates me and tolerates me for some reason maybe because theyre scared maybe some sort of pity i dont know im sick of being yelled at whenever im at home im sick of it all i cant do this i want out so badly but i cant get away i cried in school today because she screamed at me in the car she didnt care at all does anyone fucking care people say they do but realistically theres no reason i wish people would just get it out of the way and stop being fucking pussies and just tell me if they had an issue so i could stop being a fucking burden im pissed and im scared and i hate myself and i hate people around me and i wish i could just end it all right here and right now but i cant because im too much of a pussy the closest thing i can do is starve myself and throw my guts up which is a fun little tradition that ive had for over a year thankfully my mother being the kind soul she is tells me that is bad and will make me fat thanks mom im just so sick of this im powerless and weak and i know i am and i wish i had access to a rope right now ill probably forget all about this in the morning too its just that today was a fucking hell day im tired,1
is it normal to think only of negative things from the past or even see the past worse than it was while depressed i keep going over a certain experience from the past the lasted for years but it doesnt meet the criteria of ptsd but there was mistreatment from superiors and bullying from other colleagues but it wasnt consistent actually most of the time i was treated better except for some situations that i keep remembering till now weeks ago i switched to a different ssri and i started having symptoms like anxiety panic ruminating over that experience and feeling worthless which i think were withdrawal symptoms from the old drug lexapro i noticed that these symptoms come when there is something wrong with the medication or i am going through a stressful time i got a panic attack at work and my manager noticed and when i asked for some time off to recover they stalled and then they released an exit visa from the country and told me i would work remotely from my home country but there is no guarantee that they would keep their word so now i am faced with the possibility of going back to my country which is going through a tough time economically and uncertainty about finding a new job i am now back to the old drug i used to take and increased the dosage to mg with the drs supervision i am not sure if the medication is not working yet or that i am going through a challenging time so i am having anxiety i spend most of the time alone in my hotel room thinking of the past and worrying about the future and i am just exhausted your insight would be appreciated,1
no matter how much i try to change i never feel like i belong or like im enough not sure what to do anymore,1
i dont like posting anything about myself online because in the long run i feel like it only makes things worse but i need advice from people with experience im years old and despite having a job that allows me to pay the bills i feel the lowest ive ever felt in my life im mentally and physically exhausted the majority of the day and despite making changes in my diet and exercise i feel completely empty i felt better and more alive when i spent my weekends heavily drinking even though those nights would usually end with me having heart palpitations and feeling like i was going to die at least when i was inebriated i could feel a spark of the happiness i had when i was younger and that feeling made me want to drink more and more just to keep that spark alive unfortunately now when i drink i get panic attacks that take days for me to get over so its not even an option for me anymore for the first time in my life im considering therapy because at this point i dont know what other alternative to turn to the only reason its taken me this long to consider it an option is because i feel like i already know what a therapist would say to me as pessimistic and presumtuous as it is it seemed pointless ill admit it would be nice to vent to someone but is that really all there is to it i have to be wrong im going to look for a therapist first thing tomorrow but in the meantime i want to hear from those of you with experience did any of you share similar skepticism and end up surprised by the results thanks in advance for your input,1
why is life so overwhelming why do i always have to worry about everything why do i keep making bad choices why cant i just have a normal life,1
i hate this world i hate this life and i hate myself i hate who i am i hate how i am i hate the way i sound i hate looking in the mirror i hate existing every time i go to sleep i pray i wont wake up every time i wake up i face the disappointment im so tired of being a burden im so tired of ruining everything around me im so fucking tired of being me i dont want to be here anymore everything breath i breathe is more than i can take every day that passes i become more curious eager to find out what happens after death everyday i fight the urge to find out i cant go one hour without pointing out everything wrong with me i cant go a day without wishing i wasnt here it doesnt get better it never will every time i make the tiniest bit of progress life come and hits me like a fucking bus breaking down and destroying everything ive worked so hard to build up ive come to the conclusion i just wasnt made for living wasnt made to survive the longer im here the worse and longer ill suffer im so tired im so alone no one understands no one listens no one cares they never have i crave the feeling of being loved the feeling of being normal and accepted i have nothing in my life nor have i done anything with it whats the point in trying to make someone i hate thrive whats the point of living a life ive never wanted a life ive never felt loved or welcomed in im ready to go i dont find myself being scared of what will happen to me anymore i dont find myself wondering if theres a heaven or hell i dont find myself worrying how itll feel i only seem to think that whatevers waiting cant make me feel worse than i already do i have no one and nothing everyone in my life says im overreacting or doesnt even listen enough to understand how i feel im so worthless and useless i feel so pathetic cant get the energy to get out of bed so i just sit here with my thoughts and they eat me alive im not eating im barely drinking im not living so whats the point why am i here,1
i cant seem to want help maybe its because every time ive sought out help they havent helped me and just throw me in a mental hospital but now i just cant ask for help what do i do,1
i am just curious that is there anyone just like me if yes i really need some advice i recently had a very bad depression episode few days ago and even though i am done with the episode and my emotions are more stable right now my brain doesnt seem to be functioning in any way i thinking of everything but nothing at the same time like i really cant catch my thoughts or even think anything logically or sensibly and i feel like a zombie just do everything based on experience and instinct and the worst part is people dont understand that because you look completely normal and functional they think youre fine now because you stop crying or being depressed you can finish normal tasks or conversation because you are in autopilot mode but when it comes to something that requires more brainpower you are broken and sometimes it takes weeks or months to really snap out it but life doesnt give you the luxury of doing that it stresses me out how on earth do i suppose to do to deal with this,1
i just lie about being happy but when i drink and smoke ik the truth i honestly dont see myself living past im just going through the emotions and trying to survive,1
i am screaming and no one hears me i sob constantly i cant deal with these lows anymore its like everything crashed at once and im too shook to even pick up the pieces i crave peace comfort in any way all i do is cry to myself i did everything i could to fix this medication therapy and so much more and yet the water is rising still,1
i have all these emotions inside of me that are just trapped inside i cant express myself the way i want to and its killing me i show almost emotion every single day and i feel like an outcast i can laugh smile be excited in front of people but i only do it for them not for myself when i am alone i get this certain feeling in my head of all my feelings trying to come out at the same time i hold it in and it feels indescribable like a literal wave nothingness that washes over me then i just hold the blankest face ever i do this almost all the time except when listening to people and talking to them its so hard just observing my life with no feelings occasionally it will become too much and i overflow with tears and confusing feelings but nobody knows this i get this feeling of laughter and denial that turns into a feeling of sadness and tears i hate this i hate myself i hate that i feel weird being told i love you by a family member and being unable to say it back i want to but i just cant i dont know im so sick of myself i dont like it when people do something nicethoughtful for me because deep down i dont want anyone to care for me so i can kill myself leaving the smallest impact i can,1
ive been depressed for a few years now i dont feel totally lost somewhere inside me i still have hope i still have a real belief that its possible for me to feel normal and happy again but theres a much stronger feeling an overwhelmingly powerful one that even if i could be happy again i dont deserve it i dont deserve support from others i dont deserve to make small gains for myself every time i start to move in a positive direction every time others give me advice and offer help every time it seems like im finally digging myself out of the hole i stop myself i hurt myself i dont let myself get better because i feel like i dont deserve to be better i hate it it feels totally inescapable no matter what progress or advantage im giving i end up deliberately damaging it and tossing it away because i cant escape the feeling that i deserve nothing but suffering that its an injustice to the world if i get better does anyone else feel this way is there any way to feel worthy,1
i have no one to talk to about my struggles i am completely alone save for the limited social interaction i receive at work and even that is only as much as is professionally necessary i used to be able to smile and laugh to people but ive been so lonely for so long that it takes everything i have to keep that up anymore everyone around me can tell that im sad and that just makes me feel all the more unwanted and disdained the last people i opened up to got so much secondhand stress that they completely shut me out every second im not at work im just sitting in my empty house theres no joy in anything anymore there is absolutely nothing to look forward to on a daytoday basis this all just feels so fundamental that i dont even know where to begin to solve it theres no real conscious impetus to my actions anymore just listless impulse driving my every thought the only thing i know for sure in all of this is that every day is the saddest ive ever been,1
i cried myself to sleep again last night i was lucky to have loving parents which is why i would not kill myself until they pass and i pictured myself apologising to the friends i have intentionally drifted from and hoping they will feel less pain now that we are essentially strangers then i started sobbing because my parents are getting older and they will really pass soon and im terrified of death im scared that the darkness of death would be darker than any darkness ive been enveloped in and that i would truly cease to exist that no one would remember i was once a person with noble and great aspirations to better the world and now i am merely ashes but living is so painful and ive been seeking this release for over a decade,1
i hurt her deep deeply she was the love of my life and i threw it away for casual sex we were so connected on such a deep level we were miles apart yet i could feel her in my soul all the time we were one and i hurt her deeply i cared for her showed her new things loved her wanted the best for her but alcohol brought out my shallowness its not the fact that its over its seeing her face of devastation when i told her every time i close my eyes she has told me to forgive myself and move on but i just cant i would do anything to take back what i did i would trade lifetimes for one minute with her i am at my lowest right now,1
having a hard time right now and ontop of the things making life harder the plans i was counting on to cheer me up fell through left just angry at everyone and everything this person knows im having a shit time right now too,1
i talk a lot i get it from people not wanting to talk to me as a child or telling me i talk to much when i share something i enjoyed which created childhood depression and it effected me in several ways and still does years later im to put that into perspective to just how long ive had dealt with this one of my earliest memories is wanting to become a smart muggle witch like hermione from harry potter i was so exited about the films i would talk to almost everyone i came across about hp well almost everyone told me i canti will never be able toothats badect but more than anything they would tell me i talk to much it isnt ladylike to speak that much i was years old as the years went by i was told not to speak often and anytime i spoke about anything i knew something of such as history or science and especially if i was excited about it i would be cut off and told i spoke to much all of my friends growing up would ignore me in groups or not pay attention if i wanted to join the conversation bc of that i became a wall flower and i over tall when people talk to me i get very depressed most days due to my excessive talking i know my excessive talking is coming from anxiety but the depression of feeling alone hurts more thank you for reading this if you do read this,1
ive been with my bf for almost years and i feel like my relationship is at its end we have no patience for one another we are so aggressive to each other he used to be abusive but hasnt hit me in almost a year im so scared to be alone but i know i cant stay like this forever what do i do,1
my family is wonderful my parents are generous understanding kind and helpful my little sister is supportive and great im the black sheep always jealous of her watching her live the life i was always supposed to live i pigeonholed myself in life and she is four years younger and doing everything i wanted to do living the life i wanted to live and it hurts me so deeply to see it it makes me want to separate myself from them entirely i hate that i cant be happy for her because of my jealousy i hate that knowing that she is doing everything i wanted to do makes me want to end my life i want to cut off contact with them completely but i have no good reason to other than it fucking hurts every single day being a member of the family i dont want to be involved at all,1
year old female sorry for the long post ive been on anti depressants for about the last years of my life i was always on mg zoloft amp then switched to mg lexapro in but went off of them for about months in to try to live without them at the end of those months i started to get dizzy more often amp have what i can only describe as uncontrollable thoughts not suicidal or thoughts of harming anyone but i just did not feel in control of my emotions and i felt like i was gonna lose my mind lol amp very depressed so i got back on lexapro mg amp after a few months i started to feel average at best but better than before august i started to get brain zapsdizziness every day for over a month so i went to a new psychiatrist and got back on zoloft mg to start i worked my way up to mg amp started to feel a lottttt better but in december my dad died and i was extremely close to him so that obviously set me back i went up to mg around feb and have been having issues ever since very dizzy lots of anxiety amp panic attacks and the weird uncontrollable emotionsthoughts and always feeling on the brink of a panic attack have been happening since it gets a lot worse at night and thats when most of my issues arise within the last months ive seen an ear doctor to make sure i didnt have inner ear issues causing dizziness an eye exam i got a small prescription mostly for being on my phonecomputer or reading and i got an mri done and saw a neurologist all has always come back normal so im thinking its a medication issue or lack of something im mostly looking for advice or comfort to make me feel better since im not doing well lol thanks for reading,1
what do you do when you dont feel nothing anymore i felt loneliness and sadness for a long time now i feel nothing empty nothing interests me nothing makes me happy i dont care about anything and anyone no more i feel like im dead,1
not one more day of this torment i fucking beg you every fucking night to take the life away from me right to the point i am awake i am in despair then i sleep and all suffering cannot be felt only to wake again realizing that it will be another day of agony i am not interested in living you have given me plenty of gifts but all i have known is to throw them away now the only gift i ask of you is death it will be your final gift to me and the one gift i will treasure,1
i cant tell anyone else so ill say it here i have no particular circumstantial problems traumas etc in life yet i feel like absolute shit i feel like im cutting myself just to shoehorn myself into a community and feel like i have a problem so that i can blame all my shortcomings and failures on that my depression instead of owning them up like a normal functioning adult and improving but noooooo i waste everything i have all the resources at my disposal and its funny because i actually am disposing them down the drain lmao i am just acting things out in this elaborate drama i have constructed for myself so that i can feel like a victim of my own imagination make up problems where there arent any and poach resources away from those actually suffering you know i sometimes take a blade to my hand but i get scared i get terrified that probably is a primal instinct that definitely means i am faking it all right if i really hated myself and wanted to kms id be able to sink it deeper with no regards to the pain but noooo all i can do is barely see the white because if i was really wanted to kms id have something to show for it if im really suffering i shouldve been able to cut deeper just to deal with the emotional pain that i apparently have but wait i cant slideanddice deeper if everything in my life is all fine and dandy yeah thats right im a fraud i cant so that clearly shows im not in pain cant even get a drop out im a fucking fraud how do people do it deal with the pain and just slice away down deeper i wanna be able to do it im fake as fuck man why am i so pathetic fucking failure of an adult at goddamnit,1
i dont feel loved i dont feel like i have any support i dont feel like i can go to anyone and i can tell them exactly how i am feeling because theyre gonna quote some bullshit bible verse or tell me im being so dramatic my mom doesnt like listening to me talk but little does she know she needs to cherish my ramblings cause one day im gonna just jump in front of the g train and shes gonna wish she listened to me cause it would be her last day hearing my voice i want to spend the rest of my life doing something im passionate about that i simply dont care if im gonna make any money at all i want to feel something so bad but i feel nothing i have no real goals no real accomplishments no real aspirations and im trying so hard to see the brighter side im trying so hard to be positive im trying so hard to find the balance but its not working its times like this when im sitting in silence where there are no sounds and i dont have my headphones to drown out all these negative thoughts i have to sit with them in silence suffering i want friends and i want to build meaningful relationships with people but people are just so tiring i hated having friends but brushed it off as maybe i wasnt friends with the right people they were so overwhelming i just wanted to be quiet all the time i dont know i dont know whether i want to die or if i want to live if i live my life it wont be mine and if i die supposedly my life wont be mine either according to some book of stories,1
i feel so so sad and there s no one to talk to i might be attracted to a guy that is a friend of my bf we re in an open relationship so it s a lil bit tricky and like i wanna do stuff with him ig but yea anyway i m the only one up alone and i feel so so sad i feel like a failure and somehow i feel lije i m drowning i feel like there s no escape and i can t break the vicious circle that i feel stuck in i m going to therapy for a few months now and i m struggling quite a lot everything feels pointless doesn t make any sense it might be the fact that i m exhausted it might the fact that i m tired it might the fact that i m slightly tipsy now i went clubbing tonight and i felt kinda shitty at first bc one of my best frens felt shitty too i hate it anyway i understood i m not good when we had to go home earlier and i still wanted to drink but to drink until i forgot bout myself i wanted to drown in smth that is not the suffocating feeling of being constantly under pressure what pressure idk but i feel constantly smth in my stomach and my whole body and when not i am brain empty that s why i am brain empty bc when i m brain fool nothin good happensz,1
when i was in high school i always get praised by my parents and others since i am doing well in my studies but now that i am in my nd yr of college i am failing my courses and i am not learning we are not financially stable and my tuition fee is not a joke i keep on thinking of ending my life since i am a failure and i keep on disappointing my parents and relatives my parents keep on comparing me to others and i dont want that i am doing my best and my best is not enough to pass my courses i want to end the suffering of my parents by ending my life,1
i hate when i say things like killing myself is easier than going to college to get a job that i will hate later people keep saying theres people in the hospital that would give everything to be in your place like bro i know that and youre just making things worse by making me think that i must be happy all the times because i not in the hospital but ill die someday and i want that soon because then at least ill be remebered by some people that will be still alive and also i hate that everything that i do it seeem like im the worst at it even if its just me and one other person they will always be beter than me and i was talking about that with one of my techers and she said then what do you like nothing literally everything that i do is because my mom wants me to do it and im too afraid of making her sadangry by saying that i dont like it sorry for the ranting btw,1
im drunk and i know its just inevitable but hey lets take it a day at a time,1
money isnt important a steady check is unemployment is hardly likely that i would win decision against an employers lawyer or ppo doctor i may not have a home so i need to find someplace i can go and be homeless until i starve to death or preffered quick and painless rather than a lifetime of suffrage idk who my mother and father are but they were neglegent with me and guns and beat me physically to cause permanent injury,1
being high functioning is really draining i can uphold a mask of normality for a period of time but jesus christ is it exhausting in the presence of people i act i convince them that im fine i begin to convince myself too and for a few moments sometimes i forget sometimes until i get into bed and im staring at the ceiling feeling an empty sense of longing for god knows what why do i feel like somethings missing emptiness engulfs me at the realisation of the futility of it all life my body aches my eyes burn and i just want to be unconscious and i think to myself is this all that there is most of my life ive felt this dark presence lurking in the corner of my mind like a feral black dog following me around just hungrily waiting to devour me i somehow always manage to find strength to keep moving but it always follows sometimes i just greet it and lay down in despair think i need my meds again xox,1
i feel like all i do is go in circles nothing ever changes nor will it i feel as though i make progress and i think i feel happy for an amount of time and then i get sent back into the hole hopeless worthless a failure and dissapointment to everyone around me who has tried to help and may think that im fine not knowing what is going on in my head for fear of criticism or pity i hate myself ive fully accepted death although this is not a suicide note or an indication of one i have previously attempted and for awhile felt no remorse or regret from doing so and even now i wish i wouldve given it as i feel i have no use or purpose and all i ever do is dissappint both myself and others i am worthless nothing i jave ever done is fulfilling past the honeymoon phase of finding a new hobby i never have the drive or discipline to keep at it i see the mountain i have to climb and it all seems so pointless to me and i am left a failure again until i decide to do something else and fail once again i dont deserve anything i have or anyone that is friends with me i dont understand what other people see in me i wish even for a mpment i could see myself through their eyes because my own only hat and loath me i have tried so many times to change how i see myself how i think about myself but it all cokes back to the same place self hate hopelessness and despair sorry for this wall of text i know this doesnt help anyone and im questioning if its even wirth saying anything i really just dont know what to do,1

well all go to heaven if there really is because this life and world is already hell,1
ive been dealing with depression since i was a teenager i had a suicide attempt in high school had to be committed to a psychiatric hospital for a couple weeks which was highly traumaticand was on i believe zoloft for a few months until i moved to self medicating with alcohol and realized that the dont mix well ive seen multiple therapists but i have a very hard time being honest and open and ive had therapists outright drop me as a client because i wasnt making progress also when i was drinking heavily it was hard to make appointments so i stopped going ive come a very long way from this i very rarely drink now but i never went back to therapy or medication i cope by staying extremely busy but i struggle on the weekends when i have less to occupy myself with i feel like i need something to help im unsure about meds because even before i could never find a dosage that helped and i dont know if i want to start that process over again and i also now have a masters in psychology and i have enough insight into myself to be able to understand my behavior so i dont think a therapist can do anything for me that i cant do for myself and i doubt that i can be completely open idk what im looking for i guess just advice if i should try to get treatment if it would be worth it,1
i just failed the test to get my ged and my family thought i was going to pass it but i didnt i feel like disappointment and i disappointed them they had confidence in me they say im smart and im a genius but in reality im not im dumb and stupid and i let them down i feel so worthless and pathetic so now im going to drink bleach or any other chemical i can find in my house so i can get so sick that i die i cant do this anymore i dont want to disappoint or let anyone else down,1
it has been this way for so long i cant imagine myself without feeling this way it started off as crying myself to sleep because i didnt feel at home and safe no matter what i did everything was out of place my existence was wrong around years after that which is now i started antidepressants idk if they really dont work and my body is fighting against them or if i put myself in the they dont work mindset to the point they actually dont but the first few weeks i was horrified of actually getting better now that the meds stopped working im not panicking anymore starting treatment was my dream for so long now i hate the idea of it i find comfort in my sorrows i got too deep into being helpless and accepted that i couldnt get out so i decided to make it a safe space for myself i dont know if i want to be better i never thought healing would be harder than my depression i have no idea if im weird or stupid or maybe both i feel helpless,1
i feel like no one even notices anything for example some days i cant get out of bed the whole day and no one even questions me about it is this normal the only moments my family mention my disfunctional behaviour is when theyre joking about it im baffled honestly,1
im feeling very demotivated depressed hopeless sad and not having the will to live anymore i just cant get this feeling out of my head no matter how hard i try from a couple of months ago this feeling has been growing much stronger since a last week i am not exaggerating but nothing feels real anymore i am just doing things to cope with this but that is not even working i dont feel like doing anything cant even focus on studies or anything i have my personal problems which are ruining my health stress has probably become an underlying health condition in my body which i dont know because i stress a lot,1
im so sad all the time i have barley and friends and no love interest im out of shape and sad im not meant for this generation or this age of humanity i wanna go back but im stuck here i feel like a glass bottle filled with stones and the cap is glued on shut i wanna end it all but i cant im to big of a pussy to do so,1
i would always have thoughts but would be too scared to go through with anything but now im not scared i could know i was going to die tomorrow and i wouldnt care im scared because i dont know if when i have another breakdown im gonna do something in the moment that i cant take back,1
not saying people here are fake but ive become more of a hermit want to move back home and pursue schoolingcertification medical billing and coding feeling insanely depressed here so i made the move out here last year months before turning at first i enjoyed it im able to buy weed whenever i want i get a better pay than i did back home and i dont feel like a child living at home and the weather was pretty nice but over time it started wearing on me i miss my nieces and every time weve factimed they look so much older i feel sad that im not there i miss my family and our family dog also i ran out of my adhdanxietydepression medications and havent tried finding a new psychiatristtherapist because i dont want to deal with the hassle of searching around i feel like i havent really connected to anyone here i thought going out and snowboarding here at the resort almost everyday that someone would recognize me and id make friends which is what happened back home but it hasnt happened i have no dating life at all i get or days off a week and spend them alone sometimes ill game with my high school friends online which is the only thing i really look forward to but this fucks my sleep schedule even more i work overnights and barely get any social interaction anymore i try sleeping during the day but its difficult because my neighbors like to play their music super fucking loud why dont they just wear headphones my sleep schedule is shit i hate going to run errands because i have to walk minutes to my car i snowboard for like hours and then feel like going home because i get overwhelmed by the lengthy lines once the season ends theyll switch me back to evenings as opposed to overnights but then ill have to get a roommate having a roommate in these tiny ass dorms is horrible and i dont like it no privacy at all when i go back home i want to start regularly going to therapy again but am thinking how can i do that if i dont have a job how do i ensure i have a job when i get back home i dont live there right now so how the hell do i get interviews,1
ditto,1
i heard from my therapist that anger and depression often go hand in hand but i feel like its kinda going off the rails for me does anyone have more experience with this,1
to make this short and to the point ive had depressionanxiety my whole life its nothing new other than with age it seems to just get worse ive been through the system for help and here i am again i have a month old who would be better off without her depressed mother around my whole family is effected by my moods its not fair to anyone and i definitely dont want to be the reason everyone is walking on eggshells i grew up like that and its not fun and look at mei have problems i believe its better for me to disappear than subject my family to this terrible illness ive read how having a depressed mother can effect a child i also know first thing i stress my husband out like no other it can all be solved if i just leave my husband asks where to i dont know i have no one so probably the streets obviously hes not ok with it but again better than subjecting everyone to this bs it seems like a fair trade for a better life for them and im put out of my misery its already hard enough to live with this crap to add more guilt and shame it just doesnt make sense,1
i just stood therestaringsometime it can even felt like daysweeksor even years pass by when truth is just a couple of minutesi feel despair everytime i look at my miserable existant everytime happy memories comeit will be season with hours of nightmares and bad memoriesi know am not a good son to begin with being born as gaynot being as smart as other peopleand quite honestly not really good at making friendseven me disappointed in myself,1
throwaway because the people in this post have reddit accounts i f am married to a wonderful man m lets call him mark we have been married for years now and i grew very close to his family as they live in the same city as us while my family is in another country his brother maison m and i grew very close and we have a great friendship laughing together talking about life etc as time went by i started noticing that i was being supportive and there for him and the opposite isnt true now for a little backstory maison went through a very tough phase in his life and got depressed and suicidal he went to therapy and started getting back on his feet again but he was never the same this happened years ago and after that experience he became very selfcentered inconsiderate yet very sensitive and also does not accept any type of criticism he literally turned to a manchild only wants to game all day doesnt help the people around him is very dependent even in the smallest things mark is always walking on eggshells around him for this reason because he is scared that he would say do anything that will cause maison to relapse into depression i on the other hand am a little tougher on maison i sometimes feel like his family not saying anything when he is rude or acting like a child because they are afraid to hurt his feelings are turning him into a very immature and irresponsible man who is never held accountable he moved in to live with us temporarily to save some rent money till he gets his life together he adopted a dog and let her go because he didnt train her properly and she became aggressive with separation anxiety then he adopted another dog and the same thing happened again and he let him go he wants so many things in his life but wouldnt want to put the hard work or the responsibility my question is should we go easy on him because of his mental health or is going easy on him will make his life harder later because he will get used to life without any responsibility or accountability,1
i made all the wrong decisions i have no one to blame but myself now im alone i just want a hug what does that feel like such a selfish request is there anyone out there that needs someone to talk to id like to that person because helping you might be what saves me,1
i tried using the us based side text hotline tonight after replying yes to accept terms and conditions and be connected to a counselor a good dozen times i gave up had to block the number to stop getting notifications asking me if i accepted the terms and conditions and wanted to be connected to a counselor go america i guess i just want to go on record that i am begging for fucking help just for someone to fucking care i tried at least a dozen times over to engage with the ai interface to get an actual human being fucking shit fuck everything,1
was in a good mood today and i feel it dissipating im terrified of going back down into that pit theres no hope down there only agony and self hatred why cant i escape this why does my past always drive me to feeling suicidal,1
any suggestion to sleep easily i cant sleep until morning just lying in bed and wishing dead,1
im on medication and i do all the things people recommend i got a bike for university so that id stop being sedentary i try to keep my room clean and i even force myself to go out with friends and socialize but i realized i dont enjoy socialization they say humans thrive on socialization but i dont feel that i do people feels like a chore for some reason i never really miss my friends or miss going out with them every time they ask me to go out i make up an excuse and humor them and on the rare occasion i did go with them i would go home early they will try to prolong the outing as much as possible maybe have a couple of drinks and play video games late into the night but i genuinely cant find it in me to wanna be around them and it isnt about them as people theyre actually very sweet and accepting wonderful people they are kind hearted and patient and one of them even cooks for us sometimes it isnt about them im not sure whats wrong with me but i just can never seem to enjoy being around people its supposed to be healing to be a part of a community to feel like you belong to go out with friends and to get out of the slump you are in a lot of people tell me its not good to lay in bed all day or to be in inside your apartment watching youtube and movies and playing video games alone but i genuinely feel that i dont have the same functions that other humans do i dont have the thing that makes me want to be around others it just isnt an emotionally fulfilling experience i dont feel the need to be around other people and whenever i do go out with people i look forward to just going home and relaxing and finally breathing and doing whatever i want im not sure why maybe its a personality clash maybe i just havent found my people or someone that really understands me to the point where i would find their company enjoyable im not sure all i know is ive never really had a friend that i wanted to spend that much time with if it were up to me i would go weeks maybe even months without ever hanging out with friends even though i know it might be better for me mentally if im around people and put myself out there and meet new people as well but i genuinely do not crave human presence in my life and the happiest or at least the most content ive ever been is when im alone reading comics and drinking coffee in my bed it isnt like i dont want to have friends i really do when i have friends i just dont really see their presence or company as a priority or a need in my life other than a conversation every now and then i never really seem to want to spend my free time on them ive been like this my while life even during middle school anyone else you guys think its depression or just extreme introversion lmao,1
i have all the info i just need to write it down but just now everything in my head is on i dont know what im doing mode and thanks to depression i have no spark to write curse me,1
how long until you see a difference in mood and anxiety with st johns wort,1
ive f have been on antidepressants since i was but ive never felt better i switched from zoloft to celexa about years ago and im currently taking the max dose of celexa but i still get pretty bad bouts of depression and anxiety at least a couple of times per week im in therapy so i know of a variety of coping measures that i can take such as exercise journaling spending time with friendsfamily and breathing techniques but none of those things seem to work i dont have any major problems or stressors in my life either im just depressed for no reason days per week does this mean that my antidepressants arent working or do i just kinda need to suck it up im scared to try new antidepressants bc of the withdrawals and potential worsening of my depression so im not sure what the best thing for me is to do,1
for context was the year of my life i lived abroad and had a blast my anxiety was still there but at a minimal i never felt so happy so happy at times i felt like i was going to burst it was insane february of this year i came back home home isnt a good place for my mind my parents are awful and i always feel like im dorwning when im home ive been home since february and i feel things going dark again im sleeping way too much have no energy or desire to do anything and the awful thoughts of mot living are coming back im in between places right now kicking off a new career thats why i came home but things are going slow and i cant move away right now i feel like i was on the bery top of life and now im in rock bottom again im lost and confused and my mind keeps things how easy it would all be if i just want living anymore i dont want to have these thoughts or feel this way,1
all of my relationships have failed im and divorced just got dumped by a woman i loved and cant even make it work with guys everyone ive ever dated has ripped my heart out and stepped on it feeling like im destined to be alone forever,1
i feel trapped and stuck whenever i get super depressed i tend to eat a lot and because of my eating disorder it just ends up making me feel like more shit which causes me to binge and ect ect i dont know how to stop,1
i just cant feel honestly i feel hollow and i just cant seem to be happy i dont like this feeling it feels like a black hole just sucking everything out of me if that makes sense i dont know what to do id prefer being constantly sad than this i hate this feeling,1
ive had depression for five years now and ill just say that last summer was the worst a lot of shitty things happened but long story short i moved to a new city a new country actually so no family too for college all by myself and was alone for a solid two months my depression really hit rock bottom i was so unstable and just unwell the only thing i looked forward to was talking to my therapist who btw ended up being incredibly irresponsible im now surrounded by lovely people but theyre all leaving the city for summer break i cant stop worrying that ill become depressed again my plan for now is to take summer courses and pick up a campus job eg working at the library perhaps ill pick up a casual parttime job as well i just want to make sure that i keep myself busy last summer was tough cause i didnt have the means to meet people and interact and im hoping this time itll be different if i put myself out there honestly though i just cant help but worry a lot depression is my worst enemy and it lives inside me at this point i cant let it fucking win again i think of warm sunlight but instead of warmth i feel this intense sorrow i want this to change i want this summer to be a good time,1
i am finally looking to start getting help for my mental health it has been a very long time coming and i just cant do it anymore i believe i have several diagnoses including adhd anxiety depression an eating disorder and ocd i am very very overwhelmed by the idea of sharing all of my inner thoughts with another person even someone who is helping me and all the uncertainty of what exactly to expect is making me feel a bit hesitant to get started a friend recommended i begin with my regular primary care doctor but i am unsure of this are pcps able to diagnose all of these issues some or none at what point would my primary care doctor likely just send me to a psychiatrist rather than diagnosing me herself just looking for some helpanswers about what to expect at an appointment with my primary care doctor so i feel a little less overwhelmed,1
how so most of you deal with your families as the oldest theres so much responsibility just thrown on me and it sucks our dad bailed on us when we were younger so its just my mom for as long as i could remember my life has been nothing but stressful im currently with the youngest siblings i live with being im the only one with a job and its been driving me into an even further hole my sister has been such a bitch to me lately and i dont know why i barely interact with them cause they just always give me suicidalmurderous thoughts they always have my blood pressure going through the roof and giving me constant headaches i try to tell my mom about it but shes under a stern belief that black people cant be depressed and suicidal its only for white people as she claims i cant afford therapy atm and i just want to leave but i cant any suggestions on what i should do,1
im years old and used to be happy and had motivation and wanted to work and do things last couple of years ive had no motivation its hard to work i feel lazy i feel slow i can barley talk to people without sounding stupid and its hard for me to listen and remember what people are saying to me basically i just always feel tired and slow and no motivation i know im a smart person but i feel dumb at the same time like its hard for me to learn things but once i do learn it im really good at it i also feel like i have issues learning because i overthink things and think i will fuck up somehow and think about how there is no way i can do this i was off work for a long time due to covid fucked up sleep schedule etc and then i got laser eye surgery i got almost every complication from it made me really depressed and then i lost my job for not getting fired also made me really depressed cause ive been there for years now i just feel like shit and dont know if its actually depression and a problem lasik and covid really fucked me,1
wake up and everyday is the same this morning i realize its been three days since ive talked to anyone no calls or texts no friends no girlfriend i live at home with my parents at an age where i shouldve been moved out by now tired of lies and promises that meant nothing tired of a life that means nothing all these years of youth wasted doing nothing tired of how competitive everything is because im tired of fighting left behind by people who said they would always be there until it wasnt convenient anymore broke ugly tired and burnt out on this life maybe it could be worse but that just makes me hate life more everyone acts like you have an obligation to this life youre obligated to get a job make money make a life for yourself but i never asked for this life in the first place i wish i could go back now to that moment i was about to be born and press a button to cancel my life before it started even my high points cant cancel out all the negative and im tired of looking for an end thats nowhere in sight,1
ive tried now where they made it worsethe side effects where unbearable but now ive been on sertraline and the side effects are tolerable but hasnt helped with my anxiety or depression its been weeks and today the nurse practitioner gave me the choice to try something else or increase the dose i asked her what i should do but she said it was up to me i didnt know what i should do so i just said increase the dose because the pills are cheap and i have to pay full price for everything until i hit my deductible i dont know if a month is too short to know or if should be seeing a little improvement by now im starting to think i should have chose a different medicine but i dont know maybe i am jumping the gun here and i should just stick it out this medicine makes me really tired,1
i have major depressive disorder and social anxiety i take mg seroquel for sleep and have a weird side effect when i take it makes me have those sudden life realisations about my self really bad thoughts exactly like a bad weed trip and thats why i stopped smoking weed its weird since ive tried all drugs from benzos and opium to ssris and snri and its the only drug that makes me feel this way why i am feeling this way i searched a lot and couldnt find people with the same problem,1
i think this is it for me my birthday is next week and i dont see that i make it to then i find it sad ill never get to live my life to the fullest and am gonna miss out on a lot but i kinda find it peaceful that all the bad thoughts are going to stop sorry everyone,1
trigger warnings btw hi idk if this is in the right place but i just need to get stuff out i f should be so happy an excited im getting married next week i love my fiance and i want to marry him but ive had to move hundreds of miles away from my mum and my friends i have bpd and probably autism but nhs wont help me get diagnosis for either i havent been working and been living with my parents becase of depression now because me and husband can barely afford a basic place to live i will have to work and i want to i want to be so capable and successful and hard working but i just want to kms anytime i think of getting up and going out ive only been living in my new town a week and everytime i remember im not going home i feel so depressed all my fiance can say is hes sorry but that doesnt fix anything or help me or comfort me at all and my bpd shuts any suggestions he has down because substitues wont help i dont know anyone here and everyone in my community is old and whilst yes old people can make lovely friends its not the same i cant drive afford to drive or have the mental stability to drive so i feel so lonely and depressed and i feel so awful for my fiance when im literally saying im depressed and i dont want to be here i just want to be hit by a car or something every day my brain says stuff like that and im so tired of holding it together i dont want to be here and yet as always ill carry on ill just cope i wont kms but it hurts all the same,1
everyone is frustrating i always have to be the one doing the move and socialize first if i dont i just stay the way im the only person that i talk to i always have the feeling like im annoying them they r only nice bcz they feel bad fr me fr being aloner,1
theres that pain deep in you that cuts through you but are you strong enough to tie the knot and hold on to a hope that its gonna get better,1
for as long as i can remember i have always suffered from anxiety perhaps it runs in my family yet i was never able to name it or put a label on it during covid it took a toll on me and the biggest hit was taken by my marriage for past half year so much has happened in my life that i feel like i am living someone elses life the only good thing that has come out of it is my ability to finally see my anxiety building up and how i channel it i am so heartbroken to see that i mostly took my anxiety and put it in my marriage anxiety builds up in me for various reasons sometimes it is related to work sometimes things not going my way or sometimes pretty mundane things it slowly creeps in me and my mood is spoiled previously i was never able to tell that anxiety had built up in me i would only become aware of it when i blew the lid on something during covid the unfortunate victim became my spouse i also blew up my relationship with my boss during that time so once i spoiled the mood around me or picked up a fight i would see that things are fucked up i always blamed the spouse work or boss for the fight or issues yet the culprit was mostly my anxiety that slowly built up and got channeled where i had hidden resentments it is only during past week that i have finally been able to see the pattern and it is startling i feel so ashamed and resentful the sad truth is that i dont see any quick remedy for this either you see there will always be some dormant resentments inside me there are issues between me and my spouse that we cannot agree on there will always be resentment which i have how i get treated at work or how i handle more work than the others etc and whenever anxiety builds up it needs a channel for relief im afraid my mind will always pick these targets over and over i have come to this community to ask for your advice that what i feel is also how you have felt at some time i want to take this anxiety and channel it for something constructive i cant change my spouse i cant get that promotion but i can always put effort to find a new job always choose kindness for my spouse instead of turning things to arguments how does one make this change how not being able to channel this energy constructively not become an anxiety in itself too i need some encouragement and guidance thanks,1
first time poster so i apologize in advance for any formating issues i just came to realize how numb i feel today for some contest i f have been struggling mentally pretty much since childhoodive had low selfconfidenceanxiety and have been pretty depressed for as long as i can remember life has always kinda sucked and any good times usually dont last more than a couple of days so i guess all the hurt and disappointment has been building up and now im almost completely numb aside from the random anxiety attacks at am ive been aware of this for a while but the sheer extent of how tired i am and how i dont care about anything anymore hit me today when i found out that all the neglect towards my studies has caught up to me and will most likely result in me either barely passing uni or not even being able to graduate meaning i will have no degree and just wasted a bunch of time for nothing the tought of that used to scare me but now i just dont care that much i am so lost on how to improve but at the same time i dont have the desire to do anything about it all i wanna do is sleep and not wake up i wish time would just stop i dont know why im writing this for some advice maybe or just venting to strangers online is alot easier and cheaper than therapy,1
thats it,1
seriously every single one of us are fucking warriors from the monumental effort it takes to drag ourselves into consciousness when we just want to sleep forever to showing up at work amp pretending you havent spent the morning crying or thinking of hurting yourself or wanting to just check out permanently or all of the above i know its horrible that we do have to deal with it but taking a second to recognize how monumentally tough we are is important i think as we always get stuck on the things we hate about ourselves it is one positive thing that every person reading this who is battling depression the absolute herculean strength we have is absolutely incredible if youre reading this you are incredible the strength you show every single day is something that most people cant even fathom i had a bad day today amp wanted to try amp shed some positivity on it amp share that with anyone else struggling right now you are brilliant,1
yeah,1
this group makes me realize that we all suffer the human condition never feel alone millions of people are going through the exact same thoughts as you please do not feel like the odd one out my moms dad and brother committed suicide they missed out on kids grandkids weddings holidays family vacations belly laughs ect pain in life is guaranteed but so are good moments everything and i mean everything gets better in time one day you will look back and the things that matter to you now wont even cross your mind you can and will get out of this dark hole be patient with yourself forgive yourself you can heal and your life can be better than what it is now i know it does not seem like it and i know you will roll your eyes flip over in bed and indulge in your depression but day by day it will lift get fresh air feel the sunshine sit by the beach or in nature talk to a loved one or friend write in a journal eat something you like and take a nice hot shower and put on your favorite show keep going,1

im so unhappy i dislike myself and my life so fundamentally i dont know how to fix it i think im nothing much of anything and there doesnt seem to be potential for growth ive been wasting away to be honest i dont care about life and the truly shitty thing seems to be that nobody seems to be worth fighting to keep being ive played along but its getting harder each day my own dishonesty about how deep this runs has just been coming up a lot lately im just always looking at the clock for time to pass for oblivion to enter i cannot stand existing maybe thats called depression with other issues included that just dont seem worth solving at this point so im just wondering how is your life how are you fairing and dealing with this do you have family that motivates you friends do you find ways to love life or make it work or worth it somehow are you ever angry,1
cant stop being toxic i know i dont want to be but i cant change,1
as the title says i have lost motivation to do anything in life i can write thousands of word but i will try to keep it short i used to have keen interest in music and astronomy i loved watching movies and tv shows too but since last months its like nothing excites me anymore i cant enjoy anything now i feel bored with myself whenever i am talking with someone they get bored of me which is obvious because i never have anything to talk about everything feels so bland and even when i think about how i can inculcate some new hobbies in me it doesnt really help me feel any better it feels like there is nothing left in this world that can satisfy me or give me purpose atleast,1
i have been depressed for years because i am unattractive to women its not their fault that they dont find me attractive the problem is me because i am not cool enough for them i get very anxious when talking to girls because i always feel that something bad is gonna happen that repells them and even if they found me attractive they end up telling me that they are not interested how do i explain this to a therapist and how is heshe gonna help me i feel like this problem is impossible to fix because you cant make a person me attractive,1
i just want to go to sleep and never wake up yesterday i took mg and today,1
last week i was planning on ending it all being serious but i woke up today and just felt happy ive been smiling all day for no reason its like depression but in reverse keep in mind nothing changed same ole same ole is there any reason for this thanks,1
throwaway because a common friend follows my main account some brief background info i have autism so i may not always understand all social cues neither my friend nor i live in the us i have a friend going through a hard time right now he has depression and recently has been experiencing all sorts of physcial issues hes had depression before i even met him and have never seen him this low he also has money problems and thus cant afford treatment for his physical issues atm whats the best way to support him i cannot support him financially since i also have almost no money whenever i talk to him he gives short andor snappy answers and is generally in a bad mood whenever i talk about positive things it feels preachy or that im rubbing happiness in his face whenever i try to talk about neutral things basically small talk the conversation dies off so hes understandably a bit difficult to talk to as of late i admit its difficult and hurtful at times but i just want to know what would be the best way to provide my support any and all clarifying questions are welcome i just want to provide the best support i can,1
i mean its as simple as that im tired of living like this tired of living in general and everything it involves interpersonal relationships people politics economy thinking expectatives all that crap makes me feel like shit and i wish i could turn it all off however i dont want to die that would hurt the people around me that would hurt my mom and my little sister and unlike other situations i wouldnt be here to at least try to fix it theyd be left with the same nothingness that i feel but worse cuz ofc death of a loved one is worse than just my own personal regrets so i just wish i hadnt been born that my mom had had a miscarriage that wouldve hurt yeah but not for long or that id never been conceived or something i wish i was a blank space in the universe something that had never existed a hole or something like that they say energy cant be destructed and i wish it wasnt like that i wish i could just disappear completely from existence and leave no trace i wish people would just forget everything about me so i could die without it being a sin is there a way to stop feeling like this cuz the only way to stop existing is dying and ive already said why i dont want to kms exactly is there a way to avoid it can it get better,1
i dont understand why ive had hope that things will ever change my brain is and will always be broken and i cant go through a single day without feeling the heaviness of my own existence i suffer by living through every meaningless day other than the times or so a year i get the chance to step out of my everyday situation have a getaway and forget who i am i have a hard time seeing why i bother going to that effort at all when i would rather be dead for most of it,1
im just so lonely and in my head all the time im trying so hard to make friends but idk how it all makes me angry at society as a whole for leaving me all alone ive wanted friends my whole life i havent had any in years and all i can wonder is why the fuck nobody wants to be near me or to talk to me or to even ask me questions i feel like everyone is actively avoiding me at this point and i hate them for it i hate living because of everyone,1
i go to every sub in bupropion escitalopram paroxetine effexor sertraline duloxetine mirtazapine amitriptyline fluoxetine and i can list more but every sub says this med has the worst withdrawal yeah withdrawals and discontinuation syndromes suck but discouraging people from taking medication x that his doc prescribed now hes scared to take it is immoral you had this experience fine doesnt mean he will i saw a post on someone taking clonazepam for years on mgs a day he stupidly coldturkeyd one day and even months later he had no withdrawals others might have lethal seizures its very annoying to see a question about medication x and then tons of comments practically tell him not to take it because of withdrawals withdrawals are normal so are discontinuation syndromes you must go through it for weeks yes very uncomfortable i also suffered it but this is not a reason to discourage someone to take the medication he was prescribed for his illness not to mention he is not you heshe might not experience the same things you did nice day ladies and gentlemen,1
so stop telling me to try,1
just feel like a bag of bones doin nothing in my life cause i always felt like i wont fit anywhere at least i hate this world society humans the school system destroyed me but i did my best to persevere and try to go the furthest i could but now that im considered as an adult in this world i just feel too different to achieve anything and my opinions political or philosophical are just making me so sure about the fact that getting the life that everybody already has having a work getting paid consuming for your pleasure your needs being officially included in this consumer society as a consumer wont fix anything i couldnt even enjoy my childhood same with my teenage years how am i supposed to have the strength to at least have hope for adulthood im too tired this world is sick a huge amount of people in this planet talk about happiness as if it were more present than misery i cant stand this hypocrisy anymore its making me feel,1
i am male and currently experiencing major depression but anyways im too young to kill myself rn and i got things to see and do before i go travel see nature more romantic experiences etc the world is bs as we all know but if i can reach it to i can end it there on my birthday too til then i will to fight to improve myself an acceptable amount and then when the time come ill be out no more anxiety or thinking about death ill face it head on when the time is right if i dont die by another cause before that but hopefully not,1

have you had a dear friend tell you that youre not doing well or say things like you should snap out of it youre not socializing and thats bad you took time to get better and youre getting worse your environment is unhealthy im struggling with depression and anxiety along with chronic back and neck pain im currently on temporary disability for the past five months ive been doing therapy with a therapist every week plus physical therapy im also on medication for depressionanxiety for over a year my symptoms havent changed ive shared my heart with friends and recently a friend told me that ive been better in the past and that friendship is a two way road it cant be one sided this is true i havent been to see her since she moved two hours away in november we chat on video chat and text message several times a week i am dealing with anxiety about traveling and going outside my house im working on it with a therapist and it is slow going i love my friend dearly and i asked that we take a break from talking because her seeing me this way is difficult to watch friends words and its not healthy for me to feel bad about myself after chatting with her im reaching out to this community in hopes of finding support in a depressive state,1
im a year old woman still living at home with mom and step dad i live in the outskirts of los angeles so its not like im in the most affordable of areas but ya i went to school got associates degrees and then just dropped out after that i havent really done anything since just hopped around from job to job up until recently where i went through another horrible depressive episode and missed a few days of work and for the first time in my life got fired i deserved it but wow has it made me realize how not normal i really am ive been depressed and horrible anxious since i can remember and its gotten in the way of everything and everyone my entire life i guess my question here is what should i start doing with my life i feel as though i want a fresh start ive been sitting here for the past week and i cant for the life of me figure out what to do all i know is i can not work another customer service job i hate them so much please give suggestions on job paths for people like me thank you,1
why is everything unexpectedly hard when i am faced with it,1
anyone fired a long time therapist not happy with discussion or results so hard to find afraid to stop thoughts,1
a lot of people talk about the winter blues but for me spring by far at least in recent years is painfully depressing its like the smell in the air mixed with the temperature and longerbrighter daytime present this fake sense of happiness its as if when im outside things seem too happy and that scent in the air is gutwrenchingly nostalgic of a pasttime that can never be felt or experienced again because im not capable of it and im too worndown to anyway i actually remember when i was little now that i loved clear sunny weather i looked up the forecast almost obsessively ahead of time banking on those days of where there are no clouds to block the sun not even partly cloudy its perplexing to think i was once like this since nowadays i despise sunny weather i genuinely feel better and more comfortable when it is cloudy with rain especially the eccentric types of weather where it looks as if nighttime has arrived too early but instead its just a storm brewing not to mention i am at my peak mindset and performance late at night what the hell happened,1
this is a new account because i dont want it linked to my old one i have had quite a lot of awful things happen to me in the last months which most of which i reconise is entirely my fault i had a miscarriage and was very horribly assulted by a man which caused me to spiral develop an eating disorder take far too many drugs and drink too much cheat on my love of my life and break up with him i got sober and became friends again with my now exbf and i did a lot of healing and now have celebrated days sober it had been about months and me and my ex boyfriend at the time who were incredibly close after i got sober despite all the arguements and it became a bit of a situationship and we then got back together we were together for and a bit months and it was really very wonderful apart from maybe two problems and he was still healing from my betrayal which i will always carry the guilt he then broke up with me around weeks ago and i am at my whits end i have a week thearpy course i paid for which will end in two weeks i have now gotten it in my head i am deserving of all my guilt and pain which i am for most of it defo i am not looking for sympathy dw but i have convinced myself walking around today that the next earth shattering or heart breaking thing i will walk into traffic or try and end my life in a way that makes it looks accidental so no one has the burden this deep suicidal ideation has happened before but it feels really final this time now i have basically no one to bother with this news espeically since i am a teacher any comments would be helpful on what to do,1
i cant seem to talk to anyone truthfully about how i feel no one respects me anymore give importance to what i do respect my job see my importance or even care about how i feel im so frustrated to the point that i can only hurt myself but cant kill myself i have a little boy that keeps me going but i dont know up until when or how far i can go im trapped in this cycle for years with no resolution,1
hello has anyone here been in a week intensive therapy program where its you learn coping skills amd other things with a psychiatrist im start one as soon as my referal goes thru and she said sessions with be monday amp wednesdays to for weeks can anyone give insight,1
im really mad at myself and get anger issues i keep inside of me i feel like going on a rampage go absolutely insane main reason is because usually when i mess things up with a girl for being too shy or nervous i could really go fucking crazy and i cant fix it i overthink situations with girls too much so i hesitate and miss my chance right after that i just wanna rage i then later feel more depressed and it really affects my mood and mental health,1
not having responsibilities getting excited over the little things in life making friends was way easier i was obsessed with pokmon and spent most of my days biking around the neighborhood with friends just doing kid stuff like trying to invent new parkour tricks having fun felt so effortless the things i would do to go back even for a day i genuinely dont think ill ever be as happy again and that just crushes me,1
i am convinced working just makes me depressed dealing with people as a loner on a regular basis is draining wish i was rich and could leave it all behind,1
my depression has definitely improved over the years yet i still will get these really bad depressive episodes that lasts a few weeks almost a month im not sure what triggers it i just need advice on how to handle it better im also in therapy and ive decided to take a break from smoking to see if that would help but its not,1
its been months of nonstop stress and financial troubles i cant stop crying every single day i start scream crying at least once its all so hard and i so wish i could see the beauty calm and strength in life i miss it so badly and i know its still there and i want to be around to see it i wish i could run away and change my name and live a life with grace and beauty and dignity im so tired and distraught,1
hi everyone i was diagnosed with depression and anxiety last year but had probably been dealing with it my whole life i have a handful of medications that have helped me a lot but occasionally i get these slumps of depression still before they always seemed to line up with pms so i attributed them to that but this one is on the opposite part of my cycle i feel like im wasting my cycles best time anyway im struggling to find a trigger was there a trigger ill obviously discuss this with my psychiatrist but i dont know i guess i just want to hear others experiences with this type of episode i went from high energy and cooking dinner to not being able to shower or work i felt disconnected from my partner like we were more in an arrangement to be married not in love that sounds awful but my emotions just werent there i think im coming out of it now i took a shower got my eyebrows done and had my legs waxed maybe ill pay to get a manipedi thank you for reading my ramble is this just life with depression,1
i m for the past years have been pretty depressed since i grew up moving home to home among my relatives constantly being around drugs and alcohol since i move around a lot i cant get a real attachment to anyone which is sad for me with the exception is my gf of soon to be years but i lately ive begun to realize that i feel more comfortable being a depressed guy than happy its more like i rather be sad and tired so others can be happy for example my gfs family have taken me in as their own even giving me the nickname mikwap meegwap which roughly translated to home in our language anyways i wouldnt say no to them when they asked something of me nothing too crazy simple things like small chores that theirs children refuse to do lend them money when they need or drive hours for an event there are more things but i do stuff like this for my actual family too and its making me feel drained mentally and physically which leeds to my depression i dont have a lot of time to myself and i struggled with nearly becoming an alcoholic i sacrifice myself like this because i want to see everyone smile and be comfortable especially the children in both families i dont want them to have a hard life moving around or being around drugs and alcohol lately my gf has been telling me not to worry about everyone so much and take time to myself i considered it but im worried something will happen if im not around to help im at work right now while i type this and would like some outside opinions also im sorry about the title i just use small amounts of humors to hide my depression,1
i need to premise this with saying that i recognise that i drink as it is the only time i dont feel anxious anymore and its a vicious cycle and so please telling me that stopping drinking is an obvious step i am taking now and it certainly doesnt help to say this to me now recently i have been feeling increasingly anxious and paranoid after drinking about things i may have done or said during the night this is obviously even worse if there are moments of the night i dont remember or if i blackout after a recent night out i dont remember going back home from the club with some colleagues who i am semi close with im new to the job there is basically a meter walk home that i dont remember i asked and i was told by them that i was very drunk and was vomiting but other than that it was a great night and we should do it again however i am absolutely convinced that i said or did something bad that night just like im always convinced i did something bad the previous time that i maybe told them i want to rapehurtabuse someone or that i was racist towards someone or that i said a secret and even if they said that it was absolutely fine im convinced that they are hiding something from me that they are waiting for the perfect moment to expose me that they are all laughingtalking behind my back i feel like i ruminate over scenarios i may not remember or know even happen so much that memories almost build themselves in my head and from moment to moment a memory is more and more vivid this is not a new thing in my life i wake up terrified of checking my phone for embarrassing or illegal things i may have done if theres a murder in the news i check the location to ensure there was no chance it could be me the same happens in my sober life i convince myself that someone is angry at me so i will spend literal hours looking over a phone chat between us thoughts or worries plant themselves in my head and i cannot let them go one day i raped someone the next i have cancer one day i pissed someone off the next day the past is coming to get me im terrified of getting out of bed as something will trigger panic if someone can relate to this then i virtually plead for a comment or chat i feel like i am losing control of my thoughts and emotions and this goes for sober life as much as when i drink,1
im probably not as intense than anyone here idk but i feel alone not my parents not my friend in school nobody barely caare about me not even talking none i feel this heart of mine is just as empty as a loud barrel and as freezing as morning winter in the mountains im tired of trying trying to make them even glance at me i tried all the thigs i could think of such as being more talkative pop more jokes they do laugh but i dont feel any noteable form of relationship at first i thought i could fight by myself so even if i have no mental support i could breach through life but as days come it gets worse now everytime i think about it my neck and arm feels itchy and tingly i dont want to die but at the same time i dont want to continue i wish there is this option of sleeping it away forever tbf why am i even writing this what did i think somebody gonna come and care ridiculous,1
so tired of doing life and being here im slowly just falling apart again yet im supposed to just keep on going for whatever reason i dont even understand the point of life anymore nothing matters to me anymore and its scaring me that i just dont feel like living anymore here we go again down this spiral,1
i dont feel very good its like i dont belong in this world i dont think i ever did my friends are happy and im always the one whos not really funny and who ruins the mood so now i try to say as little as possible people always ask me if im okay if im tired or worse they say im scary i think im just a mistake people must find me weird or creepy its ruining me a few years ago my brother committed suicide i felt very close to him i think about his death all the time i wish i could start my life over again and make the right choices for once what affects me the most is girls i think its ridiculous but i would love to have a relationship with a very pretty girl sometimes i think ive suffered so much that i would at least deserve that i saw the damage my brothers death caused in my family now i think if i didnt have a family to make suffer gt suicide my message is so selfish and i know it thank you for reading these few lines lust,1
when i look back year ago for example its not so much that it feels like life has changed but more like its absolutely not the same reality im in the exact same house that i was in the exact same rooms and the exact same backyards but its just not the same place it felt like a different world despite there being very few things different from the environment it generally isnt very distressing but it gets in the way when i wanna be happy again i dont know how to completely explain this phenomenon but i do know that its mental,1
ive been feeling awfully lonely lately ive been socially isolating myself for the longest time now because i was dealing with shit like sudden weight gain crying over my past or having lack of friends in my class but i know how to solve those issues like going to a bar talking on different discord servers local meetups or joining an interest club etc seems logical right thats how to solve my feelings of loneliness but at the same time i feel like everything requires too much effort i want to make new friends but at the same time i dont want to and i end up accidentally ghosting people because of my social isolation i want to talk to people about my interests and discover new shows or theories but at the same time i feel tired and dont want to i end up sobbing again because i feel like im stuck in a loop like this and dont know what to do anymore please tell me whats wrong with me i hate this dilemma,1
ok so mem have been with my gff for a little over three years we have had a very very difficult relationship recently have found out that she has bpd we have had problems with being intimate with each other for majority of the relationship she had given birth to her kid just a few months before we got together so i figured it was post partom granted i have been a bit understanding not the best but ive tried very hard however it will be years soon since shes had him so im not understanding as much now as to why its such an issue to want me we will have literal fights about it cause i feel like im not loved or wanted she always tells me its not me and its just her head but as a person who has a lot of mental disorders i just cant seem to believe her so now she gets diagnosed with bpd and im wondering if this would have an effect on her sex drive also i also have bpd but i still have a sex drive its getting to the point that i want to leave the relationship cause im not getting what i need i have a very high sex drive and she was told about this when we started dating i love her with everything in me and would love to spend the rest of my life with her and our child i just dont know if i can continue to go on feeling like this every time i want to be touched,1
honestly i feel like gods longest running joke and im just tired of it everything has always felt empty and hopeless my dad died before i was born my mom went crazy i invested all my teen years in caring for her that i now i have no idea who i am or have any social skills and now shes dead i thought it would help me move on but a few months after my boyfriend cheated on me and i left to a a new town for school since coming here ive only come to realize im not anything my only reason to exist was to care for my mom and now thats gone theres no purpose for me ill never be normal like everyone else never fit in never be pretty or smart or liked im just worthless now i really want to just give up each day im more and more tempted to withdraw from college and live off my inheritance the rest of my life never leaving my apartment and only getting high to feel something more than regret and depression,1
so when i have my real bad downs there isnt any way to just pull me out of there i usually just sit through it its not nice but i cant do anything about it why is it that other people keep suggesting find a way out of it its not like i havent tried i get to hear that everytime i open up a bit about that topic then i regret doing so it feels like im failing at everything when they mention stuff like that like im too stupid to find a way out how do you deal with such stuff do you deal with it in the first place,1
ive been feeling this way for almost all my life but wayy more so in the past year,1
im a year old male i really cant be bothered to let all this bullshit play out for the rest of my life my family is dead or too abusive for me to risk speaking too i have let countless opportunities get away from me and now my only skill is dishwashing and cooking which i hate and i am forced to do it to survive and pay my rent im by no means physically attractive and constantly am told subtly or not that i am ugly really like my facial structure itself is terrible im losing my hair at this early age and have a gross and large surgery scar on my stomach people look at me with disgust in public i have such low self esteem i cannot ever stand up for myself and if i try i get laughed at constantly treated with no respect unless its sympathy or pity and im very awkward and weird i always make mistakes cant handle myself under pressure constantly miss things and can barely make life decisions on my own which im forced to do because i dont have anyone else its like my brain is a level lower than everyone elses when i have a chat with people they can insult me and i dont even realise because i am so slow until later and then i feel so upset and resentful i had a group of friends they are all good looking and live at home with their parents so they are able to have so much money to party and hangout as weve grown out of highschool age theyve seen as ive devolved and aged badly and how pathetic spineless and valueless i really am i feel like ive been exposed now i dont get invited and when i do occasionally see them for something i can afford i am the pathetic butt of the joke i used to have girls interested with me perhaps because i was younger and better looking and confident because i was unaware now i seriously have no chance i dont know how to have social interactions anymore and i always feel like i said the wrong thing that im different from other people in a terrible way out of sync with life and destined to be one of the unfortunate disgusting underclass the only thing that stops me from ending it all is that i have a sister who is younger than me and i am quite close with she is well put together and successful and since she has no family either i know how much itll devastate her to lose me these days sometimes i think she would be fine though life is not fair to some of us,1
im drowning more and more everyday,1
ive been to a mental hospital under involuntary admission but almost years ago as a minor was hoping for some help is it expensive relatively and with insurance maybe for like days is it generally not recommended unless absolutely necessary to go to an adult ward im almost and i dont want to cost my parents more money considering college but i think i need help unsure what to do,1
hello i dont know whats wrong with me nothing in life is fun brings me joy or motivates me all i wish is to lie in bed all day and stare at the wall i opened this thread because lately i have more and more thoughts like whats the point of this why do this another years and after another successful ski weekend with family i just prefered to stay in bed after skiing for min ampxb its not something that just started to happen a few weeks ago it follows me since childhood i would say nothing ever motivated or brought me joy me except computer games as kid but not even games nowadays bring me joy at all somehow i got through all schools till university without doing anything and missing about of classes even in university my motvation is still equal and thus i am still stuck in bachelor after yearsi write exams from time to time because i guess thats something you have to do in life but my motivation is negativ but when ifind a tiny bit of motivation to write an exam i usually write very good grades while not attended class at uni over all these years but they dont make me happy nor motivate me for more but its definitely not the issue with the chosen path i tried different part time jobs like char mech hotelero sales not retail vet or logistics zero motivation for any of it it always started fine while i kept up my mask but usually after few weeks i couldnt find motivation to stand up anymore and quit but also here they usually were happy with me and few even called me year later to help out again during summer holiday etc i dont find any sports enjoyable handballunihockeyskisailingboxing tried and tried nothing lasted over a month except gym once because i thought all my problems are because of my physical appearance not even this gave me any motivation even though after intensive few months i got way more attention from women people treated me better and so on a normal human would be so happy with this change for me it was whatever lets go back to bed ampxb this no motivation follows me everywhere i had a few romances including two longer relationships which lasted years and years with very beautifulampgreat character women but the same problem again no motivation obviously i fucked up and they eventually left because i had no motviation to put any effort in i have great friends since childhood even now almost towards y they still meet multiple times per month and go on holiday times year since we are even here no motivation i usually join the holiday once a year but this is like enough it is just not fun to me to hang out no they are very good people alone for the fact they still ask me out even tho i go deep sea most of the year i just dont want to deal with any humans i guess kinda same with my family i could call them any time and the financials are covered by my father i just dont want to be alone what i tried so far x different therapist ambulant weekly session gt completley useless i lose motivation to go there after few times and dont feel i achieved anything ever from talking medicaments gt worst decision ever while it completley killed all my thoughts which i enjoyed i had even less motivation to leave my bed and the sweating side effects made it even worse what a wasted year until i found the motivation to contact someone and say what happened clinic gt after week i just wanted to leave and this stayed with me for the remaining months felt like a waste of time i had motivation and every morning to stand up was a fight with my inner self ampxb tldr no motivation or joy in life since childhood for anything literally and i just wonder whats the point to live another years laying in bed good grades hot gf amazing friends good looking nothing brings joy ampxb no im not suicidal i just wonder am i missing something anyone in a simillar situation found a solution,1
my spouse cheated on me a long time ago after which things became pretty good she was nice to me worked her way to get me back and make me love her which i did for about years and then i started feeling the urge to have someone else in my life and see what it feels like to be with someone else than my wife i went down the worse path i lied to someone about my marriage being in turmoil and how i still feel neglected by my spouse i started giving more time to the affair over calls and whatsapp instead of providing the necessary time to my wife and daughter recently everyone found out about this as the woman i was involved with was talking to me while her husband was home now her husband informed everything to my wife i am constantly trying to say sorry and ask for forgiveness my wife is talking to the other women and she is providing more details about what i used to say and not during this affair sometimes i will feel weird about patching up with my wife but will stop myself and withdraw myself because i used to feel it was unjust to her while i am in another relationship to touch her kiss her or even say i loved her i am this horrible human being and i feel i dont deserve any of them now i have a hard time just living let alone working i wish my wife forgives me i tried talking her into marriage counseling but her point is you have mental issues why should she suffer cant look into my daughters eyes she doesnt know anything same with mom my only support system in the world after i lost my dad this year was my brother he knows everything about this now and is withdrawn from me and anyway he lives in a different country i will be ok living alone too i mean i will understand if my wife leaves me now she has not decided anything yet but to stay like this its difficult do i have a right to live is there any hope for a monster like me please help if you think i am still worth living and loving,1
some people dont understand that it was hard to wake up when youre not motivated and when you woke up early it is just you had strength to wake up and atleast self reflect not because you wanted to do chores,1
im struggling atm not as bad as i have been previousy however my logical mind seems to be undermining me everywhere i go it feels like people only want relationships that have a transactional value the person that i am doesnt matter lots of people cant understant even basic concept regarding lots of things yet i seem to understand them fine for instance giving without receiving seems to be something the majority of people cant understand i try and find communities but my values of trying to not inflict suffering and looking at the world in way that is communitive rather than idividualisticseems to be considered extreme the only friends i had made since i got sober verbally and physically abused me and the other people didnt stand up for me and then acted like nothing happened after i lost my home due to it i tried to go to the buddhist center for guidance as it seems most inline with a lot of my beliefs but there wasnt a proper teacher there and very few members i need some help with human contact how to find a group that isnt so polarzed it creates echo chambers and also not so unaware it is detrementle for mental health i volunteer i go to the gym im fit and healthy except for my mind atm and even then its because i live in a world where i see all the death and hatred and how easy it couldbe different so possibly understandable i would just like to beleive that i am not invisable that i matter to someone somewhere but i dont if i died right now it would be an inconvenience because someone else would have to stop what they were doing to clean up and post an add on roomshare ampxb i feel like i spent so much time learning buddhism and stoicism just to be confronted by a world that is incredibly selfish and doesnt want me in it and i understand this is black and white thinking and i understand this isnt the entire planet but its the world that is available to me and the possibilities are lacking,1

hello my now ex so has been diagnosed with depression we have had a wonderful relationship built upon many common interests and values and family blending he pursued me and we both wanted a serious committment he admitted he felt depressed to me months ago when i asked him why we had been struggling to do outside things together there are a few large situational stressors in his life atm but he had not expressed the severity of some of these to me until now i feel i see the worst of it but friends get his all fine here mask family seem to see more of it too but they also come across quite critical which i feel makes him withdraw more he seems to not be able to make plans in advance anymore even of a few days meaning i cannot clarify if we will see each other until hourslate at night the day before i have asked him what we could do to make this easier work with how he thinks etc but he has not suggested anything when i am visiting him he is often engrossed in his cellphone or just wants to watch tv in bed the feel of absence hurts but i try to coexist and just be there i have expressed this can be upsetting and that idm if we do our own things together but i need some of our time to be more about us interacting this has been up and down with things having seemed better lately he has become more irritable sometimes snapping at me or just seeming short all day i cant seem to get anything right i feel like we are always having a conversation through a different filter i could be talking about something abstract and he will somehow interpret it as a criticism eg the other day i had mentioned a friend bought new clothes for her partner as he was in need of some replacements and so took this as a sly comment at him to update his own wardrobe i try to do nice things for him leaving notes bringing comfort items making food offering to talk if he needs to he never wants to talk and the nice things seem to leave little impact after an hour the task of organising our time together is mostly mine i have asked he share more of this how he can such as both of us deciding on food options sometimes or suggesting something to do just home stuff like movies but this seems to have caused more strain despite him saying he was happy to do it he has admitted he struggles to discuss his own feelings but also told me he will always be honest which is now untrue as he seems unable to do so when i try to talk about my feelings on a matter related or unrelated he tends to get frozen up and doesnt say much if it involves him in any way he has been snapping more and recently and told me he does not have to talk about things just because i want to i was hurt things took a turn recently and he ended it i was confused as things had been on the up that week he had started meds a few weeks prior and had a promotion he said he doesnt know if we fit together but cannot explain why then that it was actually him because he cannot sustain a relationship right now then that he doesnt know who he is and just wants to be alone to figure himself out and cannot see ahead of himself or focus but said he loves me and thinks i deserve better i dont know what to think is this typical of anyone elses experience with depression and their so if so what did you feel when it was you did you come back to your partner if your symptoms improved or you recieved working treatment i have been depressed before but recovered with treatment however i can see all our experiences will differ and how people react to a partner will not always be the same it manifested differently for me so i am seeking insight and advice on how to proceed,1

really thought i was seeing some progress last week but guess not just fucking tired of everything and feeling like shit literally no one actually cares,1
i am not able to do anything had some mental breakdowns i am scared to call people or socialise even though i am a empath i keep extreme anger with me and cant controll it sometimes i just start to rage for small things cuz i feel like beeing on the edge at all times i keep getting more hopeless the more days i life on this planet hyperfocused but then slow in thoughts and processing things hungry but not wanting to eat feelings of extreme tension and notknowing my future due to big problems with workeducation family relationships legal problems substance abuse traumatic stressful events happened often in my life disresepect from many people around me that think i am just a lazy looser too stupid to go to work and live a normal life that shit hurts bad when feeling i do everything my body could ampxb the moment i got myself some help was when my suicidal thoughts got really bad and kept cycling lots of times a day in my head and crying lying on the floor and sleeping too much without the good feeling of rest and beeing awake ampxb i had a dream days ago of me beeing in a city and very very strong winds would blow the people seem to walk normal and dont feel the force but i feel it and need all my energy to take slow small steps people watch me and look at me like i was doing something wrong i felt like this describes how i feel best thank you subconscious theres alot of suffering included that i cant explain feelings of guilt not beeing able to move like everyone else i feel tho as it would be a good metaphor for people to understand my point of view ampxb i got a halfbrother that is rather unsupportive and just saying something if he complains or wants me to feel bad when i told him about my depression there wouldnt be much said but then after a few weeks he felt like he should joke a bit about that and not taking it serious well brother you are not invincible to depression take care in the future i told him and he shouldnt be like that because its a very serious and dangerous illness his mom had a suicide attempt and is schizophrenic but he still doesnt understand the situation for me i think he is a stuck soul and using narcissist behaviour to feel better about himself ive seen things when i was younger that a child wasnt supposed to see ampxb for example a friends sister was a heroin addict and i saw her tripping hardcore with years of age i saw real and brutally disturbing footage of isis and people get decapitated with chainsaw and a knife with years i saw some other nasty footages of suicides and other things that you shouldnt watch as a kid horror movies aswell but they were not as disturbing took some lsd when i was older then the friend of a friend came homewho was a hunter with a plastic bag and the head of a baby deer bloody nasty and not good when your on lsd ive always had problems with my family and respect due to conflict with everything outside my home and then coming home and listening to financial problems of my mom and how my dad betrayed her and sht just overloaded me always all that stuff is terrible and if u have kids dont let them ever live a life like that u are fcked real bad afterwards my brain is not the same i have mental breakdowns nearly everyday and suicidal ideation is just the good part of it ampxb i feel like my thoughts are hella aggressive and dark sometimes when i just see words like bloodthirst bloodshed i seem to calm down and im good is this how my brain copes with things now it needs trauma and horrifying things to calm down ampxb i watch myself as a person that tries its best to keep going but not having people that understand mental illness and not providing support in a healthy way and bad things happen to me all the time but i keep going cuz the immortality of our soul is not bound to this earth but to the universe so you cant escape not even with deleting yourself ampxb i feel like i cant ever escape but it somehow is good to deal with my problems rather than ignoring them ampxb edit i guess i wasted my time now but it feels like i cleaned some emotions up cheers moderator,1
i hate myself i have super important exams coming up that will affect my life in the future and yet i just cannot bear to study why why am i like this its not that i do not care i am fully aware of the consequences and yet i am still a dumb piece of shit and you know what the worst part is my family they love me so much if i were to commit suicide they would be devastated they have done so much for me i cannot die i am only alive because of them i continue to stay alive for their sakes i also have been given many opportunities in my life yet i waste it all away i hate life and myself to the core i wish i was never born,1
dont know if i have some undiagnosed neurological condition,1

hi everyone my yo son just made a nd appointment in months with our pcp because he is always tired all his extensive blood tests came back normal he also has sleep apnea testing scheduled in the coming weeks but he is exhausted and thats making him miserable he falls asleep on the couch after dinner when coming home from college he has a lot of trouble getting up in the morning he has trouble getting through the day we have a family history of depression i still take antidepressants and so does my hypersensitive daughter so the pcp wants to discuss depression with our son which makes a lot of sense to me but aside from fatigue and its aftereffects he doesnt have many depressive symptoms anyone else can relate tia,1
i love talking to people who are lonely i love helping people who are depressed i love being there for someone when they need it i enjoy comforting people who need it but im stuck going around like im not sad i feel like ill never be able to open up to anyone maybe its the pride in me or the fact that i dont want to burden others with my heavy feelings i love to offer consolation to others when in reality im not even able to take my own advice and im scared to open up and show these emotions,1
it literally makes me go to the srart point whenever something improves self steem i have mysefl so much i dont see a point in fighting this illness anymore afterall it will just be me again isnt that sad itself how do i break this loop any experiences or help will be more than welcome i am fucking up my family friends and relations and everything in general depression has taken over all my life,1
i dont know if its just me but my depression makes me lose track of time i cant believe its been years since i started posting about being depressed and being a loser and yet nothing have changed for me everyone is out there trying to succeed in their career trying to find a partner and build a future together living life like they should yet im here struggling to be at least a decent human being for years and still failing at that i feel like im in shock right now i shouldve known that its been a long time since ive been in this state but to see it with my own eyes seeing the years ago just drives me completely mental,1
the more i learned about nutrition the more i applied it to my diet then one day i couldnt afford healthy foods and had to eat processed foods and a few times had fast food because it was better than declining and getting no calories at all by the end of the first day i was doing worse again i didnt notice the correlation until a week later when i could get healthy food again and saw the recent things i ate ive been keeping track to do the math on how much nutrition i was getting by the end of the day after eating healthy foods again not even getting close to the proper amount for my age and weight just having some i felt noticeably better i was more productiveable to focus a bit more moving wasnt something i had to work up motivation for and i didnt have to spend as much time getting myself out of the i wanna lay here until i start to decay kinda mind its kinda soul crushing and liberating at the same time after a childhood of depression trauma neglect then a few years of pure hell and not feeling any of the positive things even for a moment i actually have control over one of the things thats contributed to life being unbearable but now im realizing if baby me had healthy food options and someone to explain nutrition it wouldnt have been as unbearable to what extent i dont know its too depressing to imagine anyway the point is pls prioritize your personal nutrition ive tried so many things my entire life to feel okay but without the components it needs your brain just cant do very well i tried to eat as healthy as possible as i got older but even the seemingly healthy options i had available to me still left me very deficient obviously malnutrition isnt the only thing that causes depression but it has a huge effect a lot of foods are marketed to seem healthy even if the producer is cutting every possible corner to make as much money as cheaply as possible with how prominent that is you should look closely at the actual amounts of nutrition in the things you eat and drink,1
why is tiredness and not having any energy a symptom of depression like what is going on behind this all of a sudden a wave comes along and instantly you need to sleep and then hours later you wake up but of course never actually feel rested so why,1

depression is nothing new to me i came across a tiktok giving everyday reasons why i should stay alive who is going to eat that chicken wait until youve done this experienced that i just realized i unconsciously think about this all the time in the sense that i live each day like its almost the last in a resigned manner almost as if i know an impending vacation is coming like any day coming up im prepared to be gone strange to describe and put into words but let me give an example i always make sure to have enough money to cover any debts remaining rent and cost of funerals etc im not even that old and dont own many things i never shop for wants only needs but this has been ingrained in my mind somehow i wake up each day and think if i got in a car accident what things i would need to make sure is taken care of like what things in the fridge would rot whether the trash is taken out whether i need to vacuum soon or if theres dirty laundry i just dont want anything regarding me and my life to be an inconvenience or troublesome for anyone else after ive passed i always make sure to be on good terms with people after a conversation ie never leave an argumentative interaction with someone unresolved my things are all boxed up and very easy to just be thrown away when the time comes dont really keep extra things that need sorting or memorabiliasouvenirs only the necessities even grocery shopping i really only buy enough to eat to survive ive really distanced myself from my relationships so theres not really many people that would even notice im gone im passed the point of active ideation but always wish i was and will be gone soon all these social media posts talking about how theres all these things more to experience or wish for dont mean shit to me anymore i literally dont care and have no regrets no regrets as in i have accepted the fact that i wont experience them and im ok with that or regarding good experiences in life like sunsets or whatever else im of the perspective ive experienced that nice but worth staying nah weird rant poor articulation but does anyone else feel this way idk i just find it funny interesting that i never truly realized this the involuntary actions of everyday,1

i have been battling depression since for various reason and i started to feel better recently and i was actually on my way to reduce my antidepressants in order to stop them but week ago i heard about my ex getting engaged and i started to feel like shit it is not because i love her or anything i am so angry inside because i think her and her family doesnt deserve happiness after what they did to me and i dont know what to do i have been seeking peace of mind for over a week i started to think about things i stopped thinking about long time ago like life religion reality and death which they used me to question why am i alive and why i cant feel happy i have supporting family and a good job i just feel like fainting all the time i even did many medical tests and the results were all normal i am just sick of this feeling and i dont know what to do,1
when i really think about it ive never really had any long period of happiness within my life ive tried so many things that i thought would make me happy ive tried therapy antidepressants and so many other things i certainly dont have a bad life but still ive never been happy for more than fleeting moments the happiest ive ever been is in a relationship i had but i just became reliant on her for my happiness which just caused it to fail and leave me worst than ever it feels like i couldnt even find that again even if i tried i just truly dont know what to do anymore am i just fucked up,1
i m was having a pretty good day but now i got a depressive episode and nothing helps i tried to do all the things that helped me through the years like videogames and music but now i just feel sad i dont know how to go on with this shitty life i made for myself left university like or years ago due to financial problems and a general lack of interest and motivation on anything i dont have a job due to an unexplainable fear or something i just feel like i cant and wont search for a job or something to study now i survive with money i saved from holidays and whatever i can get from my parents i live with my mom and cook for us my dad left but still talks with us and sometimes gives me money or buys me stuff now my mother wants to go to germany with my sister and send me there or any european country to get a job or a degree i always tell her i will look into it just to search minutes and forget about it i really dont think my depression will magically dissapear going somewhere alone i already had several trips and no matter where i go i always feel like shit my friends talk to me about getting a job or going to the gym and other stuff but it just bothers me sometimes in my birthday my friends girlfriend said she would want to adopt me and for a second i was ready to accept and move along obviously it was a joke so i laughed it off and joked that if that happens i would be more a pet than a roommate due to my low costs of living we laughed but from time to time a life like that really seems like a dream to just live like a cat and have my basic care covered while doing whatever is the only life i aspire to because i dont do shit even now it wouldnt be much of a change from my daily routine thats basically wake up cook lunch eat with my mom spend almost all day on my pc and going on my phone until i fall sleep somedays there are other things like going to the store or hanging out with friends i dont know why im posting here just to rant really and feel like internet people care about this shit because i sure as hell dont or at least not enough to do something about my situation i just feel tired and sad and like a massive shit and like i could do more but i dont know what i just feel hopeless and say it is what it is and move on but i dont know how long i can do this,1
i deserve to feel this way because of it im the most useless form of life i deserve contempt cant do wont do whats the difference,1
im sure im not the only one that feels undeserving of a relationship my thinking is that it just wouldnt be fair to whoever chose to go out with me you know i dont think i could face them when i get so bad that i cant even get out of bed they shouldnt have to deal with me i wouldnt want them to look at me differently i dont even talk to my friends about how depression gets me feeling because im afraid theyll see me differently too they dont deserve to have to listen to me drone on i dont even know how to explain how i feel to them the few times i tried how do you all open up about it to others is it even worth confiding in friends even though they do care what good will it do,1
food doesnt taste as good anymorre colors arent as bright little things that use to at least bring me some small pleasure just dont do it anymore all the hobbies and activities that brought me joy and satisfaction dont seem worth doing this is just my life now and i feel powerless to bring the light back to my life,1
going to be my last week of living cant be bothered if everything i do and people dont stay gonna head to this cliff i know in the morning and jump cant be bothered anymore been dwelling on my predicament since i was bullied ugly no friends and autistic complete loner year ahead went by still the same but found someone honline suppose not talking to anyone irl dew to social anxiety and self hatred left me in a pit of disappear suicide ideation what i did a few time almost fatal saw how my family reacted so i continue till im here they are enjoying life and i still feel out of place ive given it time and tried no one stays nor can i find a reason too gonna head to this cliff i know in the morning and jump cant be bothered anymore,1
whats the point of medication if the slightest thing can still trigger a major depressive episode with suicidal ideation whats the fucking point,1
you cant help me you can but you cant you could care so you can help me but you wont so you cant i see that now i was hoping someone would not come and fix everything for me but that they would care i tried it all i tried caring so that maybe someone would too i tried not to expect anything back and i did that but when things got rough and i cried for help no one was there people would only take from me and now that im kind of empty with nothing left to give no ones there but only kind of its not so bad that i cant see a light at the end or that ill never smile again its that ill probably never get the only thing i ever craved for thats terrible actually but i dont know shit has a way of always getting worse than it is while that undoubtedly sucks life is about more than that for me im not down thank the lord so i cant act like my life is over get me not wrong sometimes it stings really awfully and for long periods too but theres an entire world out there beyond my own personal lil one that is fascinating to use one word to describe life i should go back in my head it was always great every time i would be my own patter in the back and it worked it works because i never let myself down in the sense that i always care and its not like i want to be babied around either may not seem like it but im a strong person inside i dont go down easy and every time i do i never stay there longer than necessary but even the strongest need a helping hand every now and then and ive never had that not genuinely now is one of those times and what i needed now isnt even that big a deal just someone who would listen and understand youd think that wouldnt be so hard to find anyway cest la vie cheries i want to go back and fix myself by myself like ive always done but not come back this time it was only when i came back and hoped that i got bit in the ass every single time but no longer im smart enough to understand and to move on and to focus elsewhere and to do so many other things this world has to offer that fulfill me one of the best lessons i learned in life was how to take the l accept it let it go and carry on heres to hoping,1
that is all i hate all of this,1
i have been feeling for a few days almost weeks now that i need a cry and for some reason or another i just cant ive watched all the common videos those thai commercials and the last ten minutes with the dog nothing is working help,1
i am autistic and noise sensitive my mum kicked me out of the house for punching a wall and banister and that just made me wanna commit suicide,1
for the last two years ive been in a state of frustration in which i cant seem to get out of i feel like a live in a backwards culture that doesnt care or give two shits about intimacy and relationships before covid i had a shot opportunity to get in a arranged marriage because certain conditions were available please do not bring up dating because its not a thing where im from but after covid every thing that i planned for got screwed over and now parents refuse to arrange a marriage until i graduate to be in a relationship early on in my life was never negotiable thing for me i have lost interest in literally everything i used to find enjoyable tv shows gaming connecting with friends you name it i also stopped having conversations with my parents the only thing as of recently ive been doing is take a shit load of coursescredit hours and spend of my time just focusing planing and revising how i could be done with this with least time possible im ce major and ive been powering through it all but ive been also worried how being in this state for too long would affect me in the future my routine is study sleep eat occasionally go to the gym but thats it i barely connect and talk with anyone,1
im near and never had a girlfriend last week a girl kissed me and the next day all my depression went away i had energy again to clean the house i felt that my spirit is smiling and the world is not a scary place anymore the girl didnt wanna have a second date so the depression came back after the feeling of the kiss is over and now i feel like my soul is a zombie suffocating and trying to grasp some air to continue breathing and stay floating in this universe for a while longer,1
i dont have the worst depression room but i let clutter especially clothes build up on the desks and floor i also struggle a lot with things like regularly changing out my sheets and blankets which definitely didnt help a couple days ago i saw a little bug crawling on my blanket the last few days ive been finding more of them another one on my bed a few on my walls my windowsill in my closet on the floor ive been hypervigilantly looking for them at this point and changed all my bedding as well as finally washing some clothes but i think the damage is done because of the clutter my room is filled with dust especially in a few specific places and im fucking terrified of what i could find there especially under my furniture but obviously i must already have an infestation im scared to do anything in my room now because i know ill find more my clothes that i couldnt fit in the first wash round is still on the floor and im terrified to touch it because i feel like its crawling with bugs im also guessing theyve been there for way longer than i realize so i dont even know how long bugs have literally been crawling around in my bed with me i was waiting for the day my room would get bugs and im guessing it happened recently because my parents stopped being on me much about cleaning my room after i turned im planning to just suck up the shame and ask my dad to help me look and deal with the disappointment but i have to wait a week for him to come back from a trip in the meantime i have no idea what to do because i feel like theyll keep multiplying even starting to think about vacuuming and deep cleaning is overwhelming where do i even start fuck,1
we tend to be self critical and it can really distort our image of ourselves,1
this may turn into a ramble and be somewhat disjointed so apologies in advance im a year old guy from the uk and ive been planning and thinking of ways to end my life since the start of the year ive been in a dark place for as long as i can remember never seeing a point to life when we just die in the end been bullied since year of primary school all the way until i finished my gcses from the start of ive hit the lowest i think i ever have with little to no care for life anymore and just wishing i was dead ive planned the typical things like hangings thought of the overdose routes dangerous driving whatever i have access to ive considered what ways i could kill myself with them as far as life goes i never really saw a point to it if death is just going to be the inevitable end so why not just make it sooner i cut off contact with all but of my friends from secondary school shortly after finishing gcses of which died last year was my ex we remained good friends had some rough patches though who just up and blocked me midway through last year with no explanation as to why and the last i dont talk to all that much i am quite an angry person from all of the bullying ive endured and most of the outbursts are often me exclaiming i just want to kmsdie and everything in relation i have an online friend group who has often heard my outbursts but they take no notice and seemingly dont care i was at college until when i completed my course but of course covid happened and my future plans were all thrown out the window so ive mostly just tried to cope with that and find jobs to act as a stopgap until i can find an opportunity in the field i want to be in but ive lost all motivation and care for finding it i always see the things of do something that makes you happy or find someone who will listen to you or whatever other bullshit people say to make you reconsider killing yourself but none of them are useful if anything they make me want to do it more at this point in my life im nothing but a burden and a mental weight on those around me im in this dark pit and quite frankly dont have the care anymore to try and get out of it since i always seem to end up back here but falling further in every time i cant live through another cycle of this process im done and i think its time i start preparing and fulfilling some of those plans ive made,1
im having a really really bad episode right that is giving me a panic attack thinking i ruined something good i just need someone to talk to please,1
im a very lighthearted person on the outside joking is how i connect with others and its how i cope but inside i am miserable its my own fault for not opening up to people in my life but at the same time theres so many reasons not to but sometimes i wonder how my friends coworkers teachers and family would react if they found out what im going through if they somehow understood i just wish someone understood me,1
ive had depression for about years now i try working on myself and things seem to get better in a sense and i was even started talking to a female and things seem just a little brighter for a moment that was until i found out that my best friend of years now is fucking her and telling her all kinds of shit thats just outright untrue im not sure if this is the right sub to post stuff like this but i just feel lost and im not sure what to do,1
going to doctor to get a bottle of sleeping pills going to crush them up in alcohol bill and frank style get drunk and high for the last time think of the love of my life go to sleep and rest in peace,1
i am mentally ill and low iq everyone is so much better than me at everything no friends partner or family my life is completely worthless and i definitely will not endure living years like this,1
i can only drink on fridays which is tomorrow and i cant wait even tho alot of the time i have a panic attack or start crying while drunk lying on the floor crying and puking in the toilet and not being able to think is so much better than this life,1
hi im a year old freshman recently ive been sleeping in a lot to the point i dont set an alarm because someone will always wake me up some nights i skip brushing my already disgusting teeth because i dont have the energy for it school has just been boring and sucky lately a few times i get stressed or upset or dont do good at something i seriously start thinking about whether i have a use in life or whether its worth it to continue living these thoughts always go away once im in a better mood lastly free time is never fun anymore ill blank out and stuff or just not be able to relax the only time i can relax is with my school friends or with my online friend or in bed making up stories in my head but my online one is only available like once a day for a few minutes is this bad on the other hand people in my life have way more stressful lives plus i have really volatile emotions so im probably just overreacting and overthinking this idk what are your thoughts,1
i feel like i was abandoned by all my friends,1
every moment before its present every thought before its thunk every emotion before its felt every plan before its made every goal before its met it even consumes itself it mostly consumes itself feeding off of itself yet never failing to sustain its a cloud of rain reminding you that its ready to pour if at any moment you decide to enjoy the sun some days are all rain some days the cloud just lingers never letting you forget that its there its always present it refuses to be ignored it reminds you to stay locked inside so that you never end up getting caught in the rain again it reminds you not to make plans so that you wont become disappointed when the rain washes them away it reminds you to be content in your small space and to be thankful that youre protected by the safety of four walls and a roof its suffocating but its safe its confined but its familiar theres no room for growth but at least youll never get lost at first people in your life may offer you an umbrella but you know the umbrella can never guarantee youll stay dry even when locked away inside the rain will at times find its way to you staying inside is the best way to minimize your risk the rain is too much you cant be disappointed by the things you never achieved if you never sought to achieve anything to begin with you wont have to blame yourself for being subjected to the rain if you dont step out from under the protection of your small roof if from time to time the rain still manages to make its way in you can at least take comfort in knowing it was unavoidable as you did everything you could to avoid doing anything at all it multiplies the more you think about the rain the more clouds appear but again it will not be ignored the multiplying is inevitable the more you dread the rain the more rain comes the more rain comes the more you dread the rain its a never ending cycle it multiplies itself until theres no longer room for anything but rain clouds and one day youll forget there was ever anything but it washes away everything that once was everything that is and everything that will be every moment before its present every plan before its made every emotion that wasnt born from the rain and every goal before it can be met serving as a constant reminder to stop expecting more than rain eventually you wont even remember the sun which in a way may makes the loss of it easier to bare but while it cleanses your tiny world of everything that can be seen heard felt or thought it never washes away itself its always present its impossible to ignore you have become the rain ive never written anything like this before so i dont know what what type of literature this would be referred to as but i wrote this to try and describe how depression feels to me just thought id share edit typos,1

it feel like an excuse for sure,1
tonight i f drove mph in a zone and kept digging into the gas pedal in the pouring rain until i came to my senses and decided to slow down i know this road well so i knew many sharp corners were coming my way and that going that fast may actually kill me and i may very well topple my top heavy suv over i want to live but i dont have any will left in me either i have chronic illness which prevents me from working i feel useless a burden to my family society and am constantly judged because i dont look sick besides this incident tonight i dream of finally ending it all daydream about it think about it constantly it scared me i havent been in this dark of a place in roughly years im afraid to seek more help i dont want to get locked up help,1
no i dont really think im going to get better im probably going to end up offing myself either way but at least i can die knowing i tried,1
if it wasnt for the fact that my dog has to use the bathroom i would stay in bed all day and not do anything ive made so many mistakes in this last year that i dont know if i can recover i just used my cashapp as my primary bank for a job i just got because my bank account was closed months ago i have a whole month of my life gone because i had to have an emergency surgery that didnt heal properly and the meds fucked me up so bad that im still not right mentally ive lost so many friends and family members because i wanted to live my life how i wanted to i went back to my childhood home to the people who adopted me and raised me after two years of not seeing them for many reason just to see my pictures removed from the walls i dont feel wanted anywhere the only real friends i have left are online gaming friends that live in other countries i have no one around me anymore i am alone i hate it i had everything now im nothing,1
everything in the world is grey and dull my lows are low while i never have any highs in life no matter what i try i genuinely cant feel happy ive gotten to the point where i just think i cant i find myself questioning what ive done to deserve to feel this way how ive slighted god in some way to put me through this daily mental torment theres so much anger so much sadness and pain within me all i want is a friend maybe even someone to love since elementary school ive been heavily bullied that accompanied with my anti social nature and depression and i ended up being an outcast all throughout school i thought things would get better when i graduated i thought id be entering a new bigger world that would give me opportunities to meet new people and finally make memories i can look back on fondly i wish i still had that ignorant bliss as it was the one of the few times ive felt hope but i see now that i had only convinced myself that was the case the world in reality is just a cold dark place that doesnt care about you with no one who will care about you in it ive made a deal with myself that if things dont get better by the time i turn then i dont want to live anymore as of today ive got days left im not going to change my mind on this id rather be dead than live a miserable life,1
im m and have been dealing nonfixable problems for a long time ive seen that extended family is pretty much an arseholes and theres a tipping point where my life changed because of that at the end of uni i realised one thing i feel like i picked a wrong subject thats the time that i realised that working in it back in my birth country i wont achieve anything or can afford anything by myself at the same time i realised and considered my existence in this life i feel nobody could hear my voice nobody cares and so on graduated i ended up couldnt find a job for years literally years i had only two jobs one for months and another for month i never and even up until today feel proud that i worked there i feel like its just necessity to do something for moneyliving thats from i graduated in to years of sending cvs and interviews none of them stick around during that years another major event happened to me and my parents i realised that working in family is a big red warning because how they can treat you bad since youre family thats what happened to my dad he lost his job because he and my mom tried to give a reasonable opinion towards my uncles son their nephew huge debate and my parents ended up losing the job that moment is a tipping point for me i had huge anxiety issue and major depression i went deep down the rabbit hole and i have no point of living anymore until i got an opportunity to move country by myself for study and got a job in it industry for a slight moment i feel better in my life but it went and still goes back to my depression ampxb from here this is the present problem that i have due to losing a job from his brother and being an older people in my country my dad doesnt have any income at all i have to support them just for the sake being a son should help their parents or anything about family should support each other due to my depression i got a suggestion from counsellor that helping people might help me slowly oh boy its a very very wrong advice i ended up losing lots and lots of money helping someone just to get on their feet and still didnt help i cant even afford to rent place house pricing is ridiculous that includes living cost crisis that happened anywhere around the world having flatmates is a nightmare i even tried to sacrifice what i do regularly so they can have things they want like quieter place have their freedom etc but all of them back to the reason why i created this post im tired living like this this issue never ends and the only solution is pretty much having enough or lots of money people just dont care what ive been through and nobody wants to help me as well family friends all of them are just arseholes sometimes i wish theyre gone like literally gone or die my parents and everybody else in this world if it doesnt allow i just wish im dead never wake up anymore in the morning i already wish the same thing every night i feel done and im actually done both physically and mentally stress feeling sick all the time i sleep through the weekend and still feeling tired i have no friends and nobody losing money means i have money problem as well and nothings good anymore in my life i have made peace with death living is a thing that scared me the most,1
everyone always leaves in my life wether its friends or girlfriends and i understand why i try to be the most kind person i can be and everyone treats me like shit i then try to stand up for myself and now have nobody and now everyday im in constant conflict with myself trying to figure out if im just pushing them away but i can even ask anyone because i have no friends i dont know if its because im ugly because a lot of girls i meet we have a sexual or romantic encounters but they always make things just friends i started to think maybe i deserve being alone for like a past life or something idk im just looking for friends i guess and this is a desperate attempt sorry for taking up your time if this is too much have a good one,1
im trying everydayi started to drink a little tonight and i began to remember pain pain that im trying to suppress pain that im scared to see and look at i dont know what to do anymore im trying every day not to break but its getting hard tonight the truth is im scared im scared of death im scared of the future im terrified of myself i look in a mirror and im disappointed disgusted and i hate who i am i only poor my heart out here cause im too much of a pussy to do it to anyone i cant its a hard night tonight im sorry,1
i fucking hate all of this shit i literally couldnt give a shit if she breaks up with me is it so fucking hard too atleast spare some time to your boyfriend for a hug maybe just going out once in a while whats the point of you wanting to be with me if youre gonna just keep pushing our plans back over and over am i that fucking embarrassing to be around am i ugly i workout to maintain a physique in hopes you find me even more attractive but i feel uglier than ever now just end things with me already i literally dont care anymore but i cant just break up with you because i fucking love you and i hate being alone so much you call me your love you call me your man but i just feel like that one fucking friend that no one wants to make plans with you say i make you the happiest youve ever been but we havent even been on a date yet you say youve never felt the way you do about anyone else but you cant even spare minutes after school to atleast hug me i want to love you so much and i want to give you all the attention you deserve i want to keep looking into your eyes and having those weird feelings whenever we have nothing to say you know how much i fucking love you and how much you mean to me but its cutting into my fucking heart that you would rather keep this relationship more through text than have something more connecting like in person you reading this am i fucking selfish for wanting to be loved for atleast minutes am i selfish to want to keep a connection with someone who everyday tells me how much they love me i fucking hate this shit so much,1
but i just cant physically do it at the moment i have so many things going on and i am so overwhelmed i just want to cry myself to sleep but instead of tears i get snot in my nose its like all my tears accumulated in my nose its so annoying i just want a good cry,1
do you ever have that weird feeling where you just have that fear of getting to attached to someone or something like you get this thrill like yes finally something good happened but then in the back of your mind your just scared of something bad happening before you know youll screw it up or something bad will always repeat i found out im moving again and ive lost track how many times ive moved and i recently got this job a few months ago and i am in love with it and im scared that i dont find anything similar to it when i move and another thing im just scared to lose the people im close too all over again it seems like its always like that the people i love the most go the farthest away ive lost a of people in my life and opportunities and im scared this is another one of those things i wish i had a place called home where i can settle and do what i love with the people i love sorry for the vent i just needed to let it out i guess,1
but id like to be able to pretend one day i cant even lie to myself about that,1
everytime i wake up i want to cry for a long time and run away and never come back,1
i dont want to do this anymore just want to die,1
so numb it just feels like any other daily task like taking a shower or washing dishes or whatever ive come close to it but just decided to watch youtube or something else that is more fun get to it later i say ill get to most things later i dont have a future i dont want to explain it fully because i have a thousand times i just dont i dont got family like other people i will be pulled out of school eventually im gonna be in foster care starting within this year i have a lot of trauma and life long medical problems i feel like an animal that should be euthanized already i am in constant suffer my autism is a large factor i do try to be happy it is something i want i also want to feel sad because it means i cared enough about something to become sad over it right now i feel nothin i wish hope would drive me but theres no use in hoping in my situation trying though practicing good hygiene my acne is clearing up taking breaks from school when needed good dose for my pills puzzles sports etcetera might improve so far nothing unfortunately rather die than waste all this time and money,1
pretty much that am homeless im a shelter just getting by want to kill myself half the time but also want to carry on and see what i can do from here,1
im severely suicidal and do selfharm almost everyday only on one part of the body so even if i have band aid on it all the time it wont look as weird if i have several but what i want to share when i think about killing myself the first thing that comes to my mind is how it would inconvenience everyone around me i dont have much people who actually love me like close to zero but i still think about how it would be a hassle for them to like ship my body since i live far away from my immediate family the second thing that comes to my mind is its absolutism and irreversibility im an atheist and i think when im gone i have nowhere to go ill just stop existing no heaven to watch how they will react or if they will miss me or think of me at least i hope i get the courage i need soon to end it all and when i get that courage im pretty sure ill be happy to go,1

everyday i feel exhausted and drained absolutely gutted when i get home i try my hardest to get stuff done but eventually my energy levels catch up with me and i go to bed i always am on the brink of total blissful sleep but always a small peep or a creek or something immediately shatters it it causes me to become enraged literally enraged i feel my heartbeat skyrocket and im immediately ready to fight to the death with whatever entity is in my way i dont know why this happens to me everyday i pray for sleep everyday i come close everyday it doesnt happen i think it enrages me because i know ive lost its over im not sleeping tonight im so close to trying to get ahold of sleeping pills i told myself id never rely on any sort of medication since my father was an extremely drug addicted man but idk what else to do i literally cannot catch a good nights sleep,1
ive had depression and anxiety for years now im and im starting to lose all hope ive never felt so hopeless i literally have no faith left and its scary i dont feel like im ever going to get better and cant see a future for myself im at the point where ive just accepted that this is how its gonna be and im not strong enough to get myself out of this its draining ive tried so hard over the years to get better but it hasnt worked and i feel like i just keep getting worse i give up my brain is confused and my body is in pain i cant go on like this,1

im just living im not constantly stressed or anxious anymore but i still consider suicide a lot and i dont know why i do get anxious and stressed every now and then and when i do it is pretty bad i just got over a couple years of seriously shitty feeling depression that i didnt talk to anyone about really therapist didnt help i was stressing my parents out too much friends dont like talking about serious topics so i just rode it out on my own and convinced myself that those feelings dont matter now i just feel like nothing matters i still find joy and have good days and bad like everyone else but i resort to wanting to kill myself whenever anything goes too wrong or i get too worried i feel pretty casual about it too like i dont give a shit if i die at this point ive lost a lot of faith in god and grown distant from my family i tell people im working on myself but quite frankly i dont know what the hell im trying to do in life i guess just get to a point where i dont have it anymore the other day i was driving home after a stressful conversation with my dad and i just kept driving past my house i went to this road i go on every now and then to drive fast lots of hills and not any people cause its a rural backroad also i want to clarify i can see all of the road for a mile i wouldnt do something if it put others in danger anyways back to complaining about myself i was driving my usual path and i was actually considering swerving into a tree i was honestly losing my shit crying hard for the first time in a while over lots of thoughts while also happy doing what i love i only stayed on the road because of my parents and knowing how hard their lives with depression have been i cant purposefully crash my car and have them live with that but the way things are going i dont know im just driving towards my death im just living,1
graduating high school has made me confront my mortality and the fact that i am trapped to live a loss of hope when you realize this is it this is all there ever will be anyone else relate how do you cope,1
ive been depressed for two years now and my boyfriend says to just take cold showers he says that we was also depressed and he got cured just by thinking it is what it is taking cold showers and realizing it was all just mental idk man he mustve gotten really lucky he also didnt know that sleep was linked with depression im not sure he selfdiagnosed and it happened when he was really young maybe around or im just venting now his words seem a little sketchy thoughts,1
i cant say it but all i do is scream in my head about how much i fucjbuo and if i am a constant reminder in peoples lives of pain and misery i should leave and rot away,1
ive been suffering with anxiety and depression for about years now attempted suicide several times that amounted to nothing ive been in a very serious relationship for over a year and a half and it suddenly came to an end when my girlfriend decided we needed a break my mental health got in the way im an overly possessive and indirectly controlling person and i know i really fucked up i want to fix everything im seeing her soon to hopefully smooth things over and hopefully try again but i cant stand the thought of being alone for the rest of my life i dont want anyone else in this whole world i only lived for her im terrified that someone else is already trying to take her because im nothing ive got no confidence in myself i spend every waking moment of my life thinking about her i want to win her over again ive written down all my thoughts and apologised for the way i acted and ive told her the changes ive made she hasnt seen this note ive written yet but im just terrified that she wont let me start again ive bought some flowers for her that are being delivered straight to her if i cant have her back then ive got no reason to be alive i committed my entire life to her and i ruined it what else can i do to make her love me again i cant stand the pain of not having her in my life i dont eat anymore i dont leave my bed i just lay here waiting for the day we meet and i cant carry on without her shes the only reason im still here,1
i dont know how to talk to people i have tried going to bars alone but i just sit there alone look like even more of a moron than usual and waste money on buying a sprite i really hate drinking soda anymore i really need a hug like a long one but i dont have anyone to hug it really hurts and when i try to tell that to someone in real life it always gets swept under the rug because no one wants to deal with the fact that im depressed and lonely all i do is drag people down leeching off them i know it is all my fault im alone but i cant fix it no one else can fix it either and i know asking for help cant make that possible the only way i will stop hurting is if i stop living i pray every day to not wake up and yet i still do,1
lately for the past months ive been obsessing over the thought of suicide i dont want to die like i want to be happy and live but my brain keeps telling me i have to kill myself like my brain literally tells me you cant live another day like this you need to jill yourself and horrible thoughts this makes me feel like i have to i am seriously going insane yes i have been diagnosed with pure o since age im now im prescribed mg of lexapro but its not working for shit anymore it sucks i miss being stable i miss how i was a couple months ago im scared can anyone recommended any meds i can bring up to my new psychiatrist on monday thank you,1
im and i just wanna die i have a therapist and shes nice and all but shes doing nothing i still wanna die none of my friends ever wanna hang out with me and it makes me feel worse ive been trying to act more happier if thats the problem but i dont think thats working im just so tired of everything my dream is to explore the outside and abandoned places but even if i could get out of my bed my parents would never let me get past the front door recently two guys at my school said i was fine and i thought that was nice but then my friend told me they were trying use me for my body it disgusted me im i feel unsafe at school and at home i know my family loves me but i feel unsafe sometimes my parents say i dont have depression when ive literally overdoesed on meds just to sleep they say i have too many problems not my fault you probably smoked while you were preg mom i hate saying all this but its the internet and you dont know who i am anyways i wanna kill myself and i dunno what to do,1
anyone with me i get home at am and im wide awake and its totally normal for me i dont mind it but it really hurts the rest of my life,1
i had a terrible childhood even now my father is narcissistic alcoholic maniac who used to beat my mother and abuse us beat us sometimes too he still abuses my mother theres always a situation of chaos and sadness in family like were all living in a prison you might be thinking why dont i just leave the house currently im in final semester of my grad degree i dont wanna ruin my career for these fights as i am growing older these things are getting hold of me and im becoming more and more sad lonely socially detached always thinking of how lucky i would be if i just had a easy death instead of suffering im uncertain of future as well which scares me and i find death to be better choice as such i dont have any disease but i keeps falling sick my immune system has become weak so i often suffer from one or other physical problem im constipated always even though i take enough fiber and water still it wont go away my father doesnt care about me enough to take me to docs even though he has money hes govt employee so from outside were pretty rich have own house car my small physical problems are getting worse and worse as days passing by and i feel something is surely wrong inside me and if i get tested something big will surely come up thinking of these phenomena i always feel depressed and near death,1
can someone give me a reason not to die if you say something sensible i will not commit suicide,1

i hope when i go to bed tonight i never wake up again,1
everything seems so dark i cant feel anything i cant smile and i cant cry i am turning into a robot,1
im trying to put myself into a situation bad enough that my only option will be suicide,1
seems to be a theme hear about taking hints a lot of these posts come in waves basically dont choose someone who didnt choose you if theyre fine without you in their life then never take them back when they come back people who are ok with you not being in their lives are not worth your mental wellbeing in the past when i had read these i never really understood them i do now as hard as it is for me to accept because to accept it means its real they never cared they left theyre gone forever they never coming back they never wanted to im their now its been a long road a painful journey one that ill never repeat again in my lifeever it isnt over yet and by that i mean the outcome of me i know i will not be that same i was before i met my ex person i dont know if ill have that positive and exciting outlook on life anymore i dont even know if ill have the motivating desire to want a better in life that i had when met my ex large part of me went silent you could even see a large part of my died the part of me that started to actually want to live and enjoy life i didnt have that part of me growing up even into my early adulthood i listened eagerly to her stories i told her mine i did whatever i could to make her dailies a little easier to give her a reason to smile if it was sending her dinners a random bouquet of flowers with some chocolate and a teddy or just telling her a jokemostly bad ones i tried my best to show my person i loved her to me she was the world my tomorrows my happy my love my life my one but to her i was no one special in her own words there was nothing special about me she took the best parts she got better she had options she chose she didnt choose me i was the one she chose one she had no one else to choose from that was what i was to her that was my value to her i have finally excepted this i cant lie to myself anymore she chooses not to be in my life and she chooses to ghost i dont know what tomorrow will hold but i know i dont want to see it the pain within me only increases they say with time things get better for me it seems to be the opposite ive always been different maybe that is my curse im not like the crowd doesnt seem to be a good thing for me more like a curse i shouldve remain secluded i shouldve remained to myself i shouldve known that no one would understand i shouldve known no one would care,1
i feel like a piece of shit for saying this but its like shit keeps happening it feels like only person cares about me but they dont understand the extent of my pain my heart aches at this point it feels like a black hole swallowing me up i just want to cry amp throw up every fucking day waking up and being alive is a chore at this point i know i cant go through with ending it but the want is there amp never ending please im so fucking tired i dont want this i never wanted it,1
i f have been diagnosed with depression some months ago but i have struggled with it since it got particularly bad last year when my then boyfriend who was depressed aswell broke up with me i was deeply depressed for months i gave up everything that brought me joy because i just had no energy i didnt leave my bed slept all day and stopped caring about my appearance i had always been someone to enjoy fashion and makeup so that was especially hard i was heavily suicidal for a while and it only got better when i started therapy life hasnt been exactly sunny since then either but it got less bad since last week i have been feeling really down again i returned to my bed and i have difficulties to function normally again my old fears have returned and it feels like once again all joy has left my life today i felt suicidal again after a longer period of time of feeling somewhat ok i feel so helpless i cant do this again i am just so tired i dont want to anymore please what can i do i dont feel like my therapist has been really helpful in this,1

anyone else feel like life is a involuntary conveyor belt of grief and boredom we have to constantly distract and entertain ourselves or fall into a rut of despair how many things do we do just to exist without losing our minds vs what we actually like know what i mean im exhausted of breaking my back to make myself happy in an inherently unhappy and broken world had to get this thought out thanks for reading,1
ive already been in therapy for years and its not helping i hate the way i look i hate my face my body and everything else about myself my therapist and family constantly lie to me by telling me im pretty and look normal but i know that im objectively repulsive ive been consistently rated very below average by people online even irl i have never been in a relationship or on a date ever i feel ashamed to exist in public spaces nobody should be forced to look at me no amount of makeup or exercise can fix or help me theres no fixing bone structure unless i were to suddenly become very rich i dont know what to do anymore im too scared to commit suicide but i dont want to continue living in this body while feeling guilty for existing anyone that says looks dont matter is already attractive or average looking i dont know how to cope with all this,1
what is in the depressive hole here is this big brain fog you kind of not care you dont care about anyone you dont care about yourself or maybe care in some way but you dont love you feel like you lack you feel like you are bad person you dont deserve anything you are worthless everything is worthless it just puts you down you feel weak but can you love this depressive hole in some way can you be its friend can you love it can you still love can you love,1

to know that i have to experience every piece of suffering in this universe multiplied out by every possible universe that exists ie infinite suffering awaits everything and everyone and i have to just tell myself that that balances with the infinite good or whatever just wondering if anyone else has had heavy thoughts about existence that dont add up to anything good or if theres some kind of secret combination of words that will undo the past years of overlyanalytical loneliness and selfdirected toxic masculinity i fucking hate the fact that i fucking hate everything theres no escape,1
i so depressed and i feel like i cant tell anyone because i dont want it getting back to my ex he broke up with me a little bit ago because hes dealing with his own mental health stuff he didnt want to hurt me in the process or hurt our relationship and pushed me away i didnt see it coming he was happy with me and us but not himself i thought hed let me be there for him i dont want him to find out im struggling too and worry i just want him to get better but i miss him so much and miss talking and seeing him everyday hes my best friend and i wish we could just be there for each other right now ever since the break up ive just had more added to my plate my grandma is sick my friends who should be there for me right now arent and my work is having more layoffs in an already terrible job market i struggle to find joy in anything right now i wake up everyday just so sad and i cry daily i sleep too much and yet i have nightmares and trouble staying asleep i barley have an appetite ive lost over ten pounds in a month i know he cares and hopes this isnt the end for us too but all the uncertainty in my life is so hard to deal with im just so stressed and sad its so hard to grasp my current reality i miss him so much im trying to take care of myself but everything is hard right now,1
ive never called the suicide hotline before if any of you have was it helpful im not exactly feeling like im in immediate danger but i know the feelings im having could lead up to that and i really just want to talk to someone about why im feeling this way ive heard a few horror stories about the line not being very helpful or compassionate and it makes me nervous to call if thats really the case tyia,1

i m had a horrible breakup years ago and since then ive dealt with depression suicidal thoughts and very low selfesteem ive been seeing progress in my mental state and id say im doing much better than the years since and have better coping mechanisms for my negative thoughts however there are some insecurities that are still with me ive just met someone wonderful about years younger than myself but i cant seem to properly lovetrustfeel secure with this person when she talks about traveling with her friends i get turned off its like i only want her with me i feel a sense of abandonment also i dont have any close friends like hers or i dont think i do my ex called me a loner when we broke up and thats stuck with me when this new girl talks of her successes i feel like shit again and get turned off i want to be the alpha i want to be successful and take care of her i get attracted to broken people maybe because im broken i dont know if its fair to her if i continue this relationship i want a relationship but it seems that im not ready i want a bestfriend i know im wrong in my thinking how do i fix myself what do i do,1
this is a lot of word vomit it might not make sense it feels fucking weird to feel empty sometimes like im just listening to music for minutes and i feel fucking nothing i love listening to music a lot and its been offering me an escape from the world but this week has been hell earlier this week my friend told me something and that was the first time my brain went silent for months it felt weird but after that i feel no joy anymore before that it was hard to feel sometimes but it was there but now its rarely there in the first place i do not want to be like this ive just been slowly getting worst as time passed and i use to believe that it would simply get better but its like every other week some bullshit that ruins me is revealed and ive become practically numb to it but ever since i finally cried for the first time in months i can feel some of those negative emotions finally festering in the worst way possible right now i just wanna be okay i really fucking hate this,1
i recently went on a new antidepressant for my depression and anxiety and as soon as i went on a slightly higher dose my anxiety went through the roof and i basically had a panic attack for three days straight i begged my mom to let me stop taking it because it was making me miserable but she refused until today and surprise surprise i feel better but now ive missed a bunch of school and have a lot of make up work and tests and i dont think i can make it up without late points or just not doing my worki dont know what to do i have to go tomorrow and im dreading it,1
i dont know how long i can keep going ive been lying to everyone that im doing fine i just really want to die the pressure of others wanting me to live is so heavy its suffocating,1

my depression is a constant battle ill be ok for a few months and very sad the others its off and on i cant function when im depressed and anxious i really want to give up because in my mind there is no hope and ive felt this way for a very long time since middle school im now i tried therapy it doesnt work for me i tried meds but i dont see a difference in me but my mom does i cant keep a job because im anxious all the time about certain things i want to do better but i am not motivated and ive tried my hardest in the past and nothing comes out of it help,1
ive had depression for years and after turning i finally got on medication for it i never reacted well to therapy nor can i afford it the medicine is cheaper and much more effective much better than someone telling me ill be ok when im obviously not i chose the prescription i chose to get on this medication and its helping so why am i struggling to take it i dont understand,1
was almost there not earthly unalive but so dead inside where it didnt matter where craving another human didnt happen where the pain had stopped but then he came and i felt alive again people were looking at me at the store again at breakfast this morning people talked to me but its gone now the reason to feel and now comes the fight to shut it back down,1
heard about a couple of people in severe situations where they lostflushed their meds and either became manic or even once had a heart attack is this really true and if so how often does it happen,1
looking for painless clean easy,1
ive been doing so well recently ive been so happy doing all my schoolwork emailing places to try and volunteer studying for my sats im a junior in high school writing my literal college applications that dont even open for more months and it has been going on for literally four days and i can feel it slipping away and i can feel my depression coming back i just need more time and i really thought i was getting better and i scared that im gonna slip into a depressive episode again and i really just cannot do that right now i need to focus on school and extracurriculars and sports and i cant do that when im depressed ive been in the best mental state of my life and i dont want to lose that any advice would be so greatly appreciated,1
i wish i can be somewhat mentally normal and live a fulfilling life and have friends people will never accept me and im gonna die alone imma just kms byeeee,1
i feel so broken that even when i go on medication its not going to help,1
i just feel no motivation to do anything anymore i dont want to play games i dont want to watch shows i dont want to read i cant even bring myself to do my math homework today was a round of acceptances for the university im trying for and i didnt get in and typing it out makes it feel so silly to be this upset like oh maybe not this round but there are two more rounds that you could get in for but honestly this was kinda my last straw i just give up my friend who said that there was no way she would get in and that we should both go to this other university together got in today and i just feel like im not going to get in and im going to have to go to that other university and be all alone because everyone i know got in for the really competitive program i was trying for except me and i just cant bring myself to try in school at this point because i will never be good enough because i try so hard and i think i actually understand but i never understand and because i fuck up one question on a stupid test it ruins the rest of my fucking life i just need to get into this one specific university nothing else matters its just this one but its never going to happen because i was too stupid to not join every club in the school in th grade to become the president of them now because i never took extra lessons outside of school to learn math because im just not good enough i mean i know this one specific university is not the end of the world but it feels like it is im disappointing my family who expect me to get in im disappointing myself because i told myself i would work harder and try harder and cut out all my free time to focus on school but i just didnt do that and now ive ruined my chances i just dont want to keep trying i dont even want to go to university im just so tired,1
the harder i try the harder i fall and the more gruesome the defeat i last felt like i was winning ten years ago since then its been failure after failure im at a point where i try so that i dont regret not trying but not because i expect to not fail the only thing keeping me going is the belief that life in itself no matter how hard is a gift ive lost a lot of people either through death or compassion fatigue at some point people are just fed up of witnessing the shit show that my life seems to be and i dont blame them i dont know if im being coherent but i hope you can make some sense out of my babbling,1
i want to emotionally damage as many people as i can regardless if i know them or not i dont care how good they are it only makes me want to hurt them even more i absolutely hate happy people and its worth the effort of bringing them down to my level,1

im a bit of an introvert but through the years i learned to appear social and outgoing with people in most contexts its positive and useful but in others things turn out terribly for an actually shy and introvert person i sometimes make jokes about memes funny videos etc its a good way to engage with other people at work for example rest of the people do the same its not that im joking more than the rest of the people i never make jokes about the others im very respectful i even avoid any joke or meme that might be hurtful to other people yet theres always a moment where people go from laughing with me to laughing at me for example now people at work make fun about my poor diet i never detailed anything about what i eat or if i had time to cook and some of those people bring canned food or about some of my habits when stuff like this starts happening i feel really hurt its like i thought for a long time i was sharing funny moments with workmates and actually everybody was clowning me there are some ridiculous things about me my voice is high pitched and soft for a man my age and that would be a main thing im gay and that makes it even more obvious but i dont talk about my sexuality since its private i wonder if these aspects make me the target of getting laughed at when actually im being friendly like the others however i no longer care once i get fed up with all this i avoid any unnecessary socialization with people who hurt me i would consider to say what i wrote here in a polite way but its impossible to do that without being looked like a dramatic person so ive decided to not eat again with this people just go outside or stay on my own not the first time it happens to me but the first where i can just avoid it easily i dont know why i trust people again and again i know people are not evil per se but other people can really be hell for depressed persons like me,1
i self harmed myself but instead of dying i ended up in the er i guess thats a good thing but i just want to disappear i have nothing good to stick around for,1
havent renewed my prescription for testosterone because im not sure i want to be alive anymore im so tired of checking the news and seeing how fucked the world is so many bills are being passed out of hatred for the trans and gay community women are being treated like cattle and overwhelming hatred of the indigenous black and bipoc people it hurts i dont know if i want to do this anymore im so tired,1
we used to have conversations on a daily basis we had really deep conversations but suddenly she became sharp i invited her to a museum but she cancelled me the day before since she had some errands going i dont know if she is avoiding me or is she actually busy what concerns me is the idea that ive been carrying thinking im not capable of maintaining a relationship with people that i do enjoy how can i get out of that idea it has been annoying me for some days i wrote this post on depression since i feel a similar hollowness to abandonment so im wondering if i still have some traces of an old trauma ive been dealing for some time typing this make me understand i feel sadness since we no longer have those meaningful conversations but i would love to hear the opinion of others on how to get out of a mindset ampxb thanks for the support,1
im on zoloft and it feels like i have a cotton ball in my right ear this has been slowly developing over a few days and i just read that it can be caused my antidepressants should i be worried,1
i had gone through a lot in the past years facing a horrible dispute with my parents momstepdadand dad and being thrown into a mental hospital after a school got scared of me my parents destroyed my relationship with my ex and my social life making me mentally snap or something afterwards then figuring my dad had manipulated me and ridding of him from my life i took lots of drugs i wasnt supposed to take after everything that had happened and nothing afterwards has been the same i had realized i no longer was happy about the things that made me happy rather emotionless this occurred after me getting out of the mental hospital furthering getting worse after a cycle of rad with mk and a benadryl overdose of mg in the span of two days i have a new relationship life no more problems it seems like but i feel no joy and no happiness towards my daily actions and accomplishments as well as interactions with other people i go through my day seeing my current girlfriend and friends or getting something done but never feel completed like i did something but forgot cause i just did it to do something i also recognized how much i had dissociated it felt like all i think about is the wrong and past because its what i cant fix that was clearly my fault at some times i think too much about what people have done to me making me stay away and never invite people over i often blur out and feel as if im in my own world where nothing exist for seconds up to hours even sometimes forgetting who was talking to me or what i was doing i feel insane i have extremely bad mood swings no i never was diagnosed with any sort of mood disorder but i was on abilify because of alleged homicidal ideations i have extreme anger enough to cause myself and others harm i do not have any explanation to why i have these feelings and want an explanation i have cut myself before because of the anger towards myself and others and dont want to be in the same place i have had unexplained episodes before that felt descriptive to being manic episodes but never fully closed to be just because they said it was the mood stabilizers that caused it the last time i felt homicidal ideations was unintentional and was two weeks ago i started to stop caring about everything problems i had my grades my girlfriend my ex my goldfish and my dog it didnt matter every problem was the same because i felt as if nothing could feel as close as painful as the things i heard and saw from the past years specially and even further in the past with trauma i would be in near death situations even with drugs with almost dying from multiple overdoses with the worst being benadryl i miraculously have woken up every time just glad i had experienced something out of worldly and disconnected more than actually caring that i almost died the benadryl overdose itself actually made this affect worse after two weeks and a half of recovery from it i felt so disassociated and had no feelings towards anything in a bad or negative way similar to what i was talking about earlier but worse making me stop caring about everything somewhat it wasnt the worst considering the days that would viewed the worst by others was just another day for me just like the rest random thoughts of apologizing being empathetic but then being hateful and sad and homicidal also sort of like mood swings its just an array of unexplained thoughts that never get told to the people im thinking about or anyone actually and example of this goes as such i will feel happy i had feelings towards someone and remember what theyve done but then feel extreme opposite feeling such as painangerfearsadness and homicidal ideations i had these feelings and still do as they can happen anywhere ive had them for years infact do they mean anything thank you for your time and efforts of reading my post if you have any explanation to why these things and happening and what they are feel free to comment whatever youd like to,1
i have a good job as a teacher but i dont feel fulfilled i always wanted to be a scientist or mathematician but wasnt smart enough and the other teachers at my job are smart enough to leave and work for top companies and many have but not me the guy i was talking to didnt find me important enough to see me for even a few minutes within two or three weeks he was either too busy or too depressed or in another state i feel like it was easier for him to let go after we finally had sex i feel too scared to talk to another man i genuinely feel scared and i feel like im literally going to do something bad to myself if i experience another breakup i have a mom who is alive but hasnt ever called me whenever i think about her i think about how i wasnt important enough to keep me away from known child predators i feel like i wont ever make enough money to get a house or do any of the things i want to do i pulled out so much of my hair from stress that i had to cut it off and i look so horrible when i wear my real hair i hate myself so much i hate myself so much i know this isnt that much to be sad about but i am and i dont want to feel this way but i do i am not happy,1
this will probably go unseen but i need to write i feel unheard i am alone and i do not like this world i hate people this society is terrible betrayal runs rampant and hatred thrives i feel unwelcomed as a white guy like the world is against me i dont feel unique at all probably because no one tells me i am in fact no one talks to me to begin with and if they do its because i talked first im not sure i want to be here anymore simply because im not sure what i have to look forward too its selfish to say and i feel guilty but everything this life has given me has been taken away specifically human connection it is all i want but i can not have it my friends leave ignore and forget my gf left and forgot no one approaches i feel like a ghost im and im not sure i want to stay around for next month when i turn,1
for the record i am not suicidal but i do feel like i have no way out of this i have a concerning health condition that has been neglected for the past years and gradually getting worse i am on a slow decline in health and will do a more detailed writeup of my life and issues soon i see death as an option to free my body of its ailments and the stupidity that caused it had i not hurt myself i would be taking a different path but im pretty much disabled now and have tried to fight the healthcare system with no diagnosis and been labelled as crazy by every person i meet i wont sing dance look or feel the same way again so for me thats not worth it i always dreamt of doing those things but now i will never be able to do them efficiently i dont see death as a bad thing just terrifying and really hard to process and a way to get out of a shitty life i would rather die than be in a lot of situations really because we all die anyway i dont really want to suffer for too long and the world doesnt care because it will just keep spinning so there arent any negative feelings just logical and impartial situation which i accept everyone will die too so rather sooner than later otherwise i would have a degree in performing arts or music by now and would be performing and doing things with my life sadly that isnt the case and am stuck with an illness that isnt getting better my face is swollen and so is my body my wounds wont heal i cant exercise and feel fatigued every day my veins bulge and i have extremely pale skin my eyes are also bulgingmy brother pointed this out to me and i thought i was the only one who thought this my teeth are cracking and my gums are pale numbness in every single part of my body blood pools anhedonia and dissociation impaired memory and i cant even count or decide what to eat have to double check my spelling and memory and even then i forget bathroom struggles insomnia weak bones head feels full and swollen fingernails have started to club believe it or not hair and nails dont grow blue extremities and struggling to breathe cant hold head up and body feels very heavy to carry sharp pains around my body aching pains blurred vision and double vision i cant even walk anymore and my ligaments crack all the time pre this would not have been the case because i injured myself very severly and do not realise the damage i have done doctors are saying nothings wrong with me but thats not true the problems have built up over time which i suspect is a problem with my vascular system but getting seen in the uk is very hard i have also bought a healthcare plan which is not private health insurance but all that i can afford monthly the extent of damage it has done to me made me realize that i may not ever be normal again if i ever get treated that is and so i feel like my only option is to die i know some people say that people who are crippled and have disabilities can have long satisfying lives but that is not the life for me especially considering there was nothing wrong with me before i always dream to be that way again but i know i wont get that anymore and i wont be happy at all the damage it has done to me probably affected my brain to the point where i dont think it will ever recover or my heart or my bones or my optic nerves so i dont think its worth living if i have longlasting complications and also the cause was selfharm i know it sounds silly but it could have been prevented i was mentally ill and the things i did werent normal looking back at it now and its all my parents fault they convoluted my idea of normal since i was a little kid i never got the help i needed not even for my selective mutism and now im screwed for good im no good anymore and worthless i cant even make or remember memories and this isnt the depression speaking since i had an urge to fix my life and get back on track now i have a wound that will never heal my parents were extremely toxic and detrimental since my youth my only fantasies were ones of running away i dont have much contact with them and am stuck in the house with them in i selfharmed so bad my left side went number and weaker and i have been that way ever since now its caused so many problems because of something pressing on my vascular system causing harm to my entire body but i am told there is nothing wrong with me even by the most toxic people of all my parents they got so sick of me trying to reach out for help my father shouted at me and sent me into a burst of tears i choked on my tea but i persisted and called the doctor and asked for an appointment he took me to the docs but i feel like im in a losing game i dont really have any positive options anymore and am in so much pain ive lost my sight somewhat hearing function mobility emotions and cognition and am basically becoming a vegetable even if i do get treated it will be too late as the damage has left permanent wounds ive shown someone pics before and they have admitted its pretty messed up what i have been through i am struggling for answers but at the least i can get a diagnosis just so i can shove it in peoples faces and prove them wrong but other than that i just dont know what to do with my life anymore i got tired from making this post i took a few breaks and am still lethargic my doctor that i recently visited also noticed that i was looking a bit pale so for me thats been a relief he was quite attentive and offered to give me a blood test which is next month so i have to struggle to next month he weighed meim kg now and we talked about my symptoms and i did mention to him it has to do with my vascular system its now a test of time to see what will happen realistically i dont think my prognosis is too good but people are becoming more attentive to how messed up my body is so i think thats a good but far too little too late now,1
i just started today wondering when i can expect irritating things to start,1
i f lost my mom years ago and my dad years ago all my siblings have their own lives i have four friends who happen to be busy with their own lives as well never had a boyfriend i just started working as a medsurg nurse a month ago and i absolutely hate it my mom was also a nurse my dad was a doctor i did it for them now theyre gone didnt even have the chance to attend my graduation its downhill ever since my parents died been depressed ever since i drive to work every day wishing id never arrive like fantasizing a car crash patients doctors and supervisors treat us new nurses like crap its demoralizing and dehumanizing its an extremely thankless job and that includes terrible pay our ratio is i go home crying after every shift im on a threemonth probation and i wanna quit dont know how much of this shit i could take before my parents passed away i was supposed to go med school after finishing undergrad now theres no way i could afford med school on my own i just feel like a failure and hopeless every day i cant remember the last time i felt genuinely happy i feel like ive been a decent human being my whole life and life rewards me with dead parents a horrible job and no support system so sorry for venting here i just dont have anyone to talk to about all of these,1
i dont feel like theres anything to be proud of in my life comparing myself to others makes me feel awful but even comparing myself to who i was a few years ago just makes me realize how much ive fallen into the cold embrace of depression a few people have said i should feel proud ive simply lived this long with severe depression which i guess that makes sense logically but it doesnt feel like i should it feels like thats lowering the bar to such a low level that anything is good is that really what i have to do to feel good about myself lower my expectations to the absolute bare minimum that on its own seems so depressing,1
ive been depressed for about years and it seems to have just gotten more severe as time goes on ive tried loads of different supplement and antidepressants including methylated b vitamins fish oil zoloft prozac lexapro buproprion nac htp and more nothing has worked for me im still just as depressed and exhausted as i was when i began actually even more now that it seems like it never goes away my symptoms of depression are mainly fatigue low motivation low energy and anhedoniaemotional blunting this has me wondering could there be a root cause or something wrong with me that has caused these problems my life is pretty good besides the issues that my symptoms give me could i have a hormone imbalance or some other problem that causes this i dont want to be throwing medicine to mask my depression if there is some deeper reason for it for all of you that seem to be depressed due to an issue within yourself have you done any testing or anything to find the root cause of the problem that helped im desperate to get help any feed back would be appreciated,1
ever since i was years old i struggled with fnding happiness in anything i did i thought maybe this feeling would pass with time but sadly that wasnt the case suicidal thoughts have infiltrated my day to day life they are everything thats on my mind all day i never found a purpose in life nothing that makes me truly happy all i really do is sit all day and play videogames pump my body with caffeine and sugar and hope for brighter days to come even though i know they wont or that theres a small likelyhood of it happening every day i consider more vile ways to commit suicide which is something i havent considered at all just a year prior my mother calls my reasons for lack of happiness stupid and i havent been offered any comforting words like ever adding to my struggle with purpose i also never had a serious relationship the loneliness and angst grows stronger and i get more sour as days go by i became misanthropic to the point of wishing the worst on people who are doing better than me and i hate these selfish thoughts,1
i was diagnosed years ago or so rapid cycling bipolar since then i have been through dozens of medications that never worked finally after some trial and error good old lithium seemed to do the trick i felt better than i have in years or months ago i did what apparently is a common thing with people who have this disorder and stopped taking my meds i was good i was happy i could take on the world weeeelllllll over the last few weeks a mixed episode that i havent noticed until last night has cause a lot of problems in my life ive been emotionally cheating thats a long story that i cant get into just now girls i was interested in are now no longer speaking to me because they found out i stopped taking my meds ive been sexting and chain smoking and depressed and hateful and spiteful and i just cant handle life right now im in a very very bad place all because i was an idiot and stopped taking my meds i should feel lucky it could have been way worse but i dont know how much worse its going to get i know i need to take my meds now i do i just need someone to tell me everything is going to be okay that im not a bad person that i deserve love and happiness i promise ill start taking my meds again,1
why just why my life is perfect literally the best life i could ask for yet i still want to die why i dont have a reason for it my life is perfect why do i want to die then what is wrong with me,1
im a year old man currently at university im trying to do well and complete my course but some weeks i just stay in my room wasting my life away i either feel numb depressed or have strong emotions which i cant begin to understand or process ive battled with these feelings since a teenager ive had my ups and downs but im loosing faith in the world and the way things are some days i want to die but then the next i try improve and feel better but its a constant cycle i get more exhausted every time i have to pull myself away from these feelings i used to have some self esteem and socialise and build relationships now i struggle to connect to people now and just feel awkward i often analyse social situations and just feel regret my thoughts spiral sometimes i get stuck for hours i have things i enjoy but the world seems cold everyone feels so distant not sure if this is relatable,1
its been and a half year and im still getting ignored by my so called family wtf am i supposed to do here getting treated like this in the whole town is one thing but i want at least one person here to treat me like every other cis girl im freakin tired of this and i lose all the motivation to do anything im born in a country where being trans is like being a demon or some shit what do i do,1
cannot bear the work stress i work with my uncle and work seven days week for around hours a day since i moved into a new city i have no social life do not go out anywhere and since i do not know anyone i am anxious in going out itself i think work is taking a mental toll i cannot quit this job i like it and there is peer pressure as well no idea what i am supposed to do i go mad on sundays sitting all alone in office any advice would be most welcome,1
lets see i definitely need a less toxic job but im afraid everywhere is gonna be that way or it is me i just cannot function in a workplace im too dumb i dont learn fast enough im not allowed to be human and make one damn human error that in the scheme of things is fucking inconsequential it is probably me i cant do anything right i am so freaking riddled with debt that any place that credit checks for employment like everywhere is gonna yeet my resume into the garbage i just want to run away and live in another country but between pets and my husband it just wont happen i low key started packing up my desk i really just want to blow my brains out in the office lobby not today though,1
ive been depressed my whole life i remember when i was in elementary i felt like i didnt want to be alive anymore i couldnt see i point as i grew up i became better at convincing my self that i should hang on just a little more like maybe after this next game comes out or or after i see this movie etc but im now and the coping mechanism ive developed are starting to fail me now and i struggle with finding anything else to keep me from going over the edge and ending it all it has gotten to the point where i was waiting for a train the other day and i heard the train coming and for a second i felt the urge like my body tending up waiting to move as if to jump in front of the train i ended up thinking to much and didnt jump but the feeling was real and i was scared i dont know what to do anymore,1
ive been poor most of my life and even though ive been working hours per day and spend as little money as possible for many years ive only managed to pay back my student debts two years ago since then ive been focused on saving more money and maybe one day be able to have a better life lately ive started becoming more and more jealous of people who grew up rich crypto millionaires and lottery winners like the yearold girl who recently won million the first time playing the lottery are you kidding me i often fantasise about having bought btc when it was cheap or having mined a few coins or having been part of the gamestop spectacle i know that its wrong to be jealous but honestly how could we not be when it forces us to work hours every day and affects the rest of our lives im trying my best to be happy and have positive feelings about others anyway but i find it increasingly difficult,1
i am making no significant strides to become better or get my shit together i think the possibility of suicide has been looming over me for so long that im using it as an excuse to not get my shit together if that makes sense like oh i dont need to figure out a career path cause im probably going to kms my life is going no where and i dont care enough to do anything about it i have absolutely nobody im just a disappointment to myself and my family idk what im waiting for,1
i am a piece of shit who keeps talking when i shouldnt i say the wrong things i cant thibk properly i do the wrong things i look the wrong way everything abt me is just wrong i hate myself so fucking much and im isolating myself even more i dont wanna cry again its really fucking pathetic on the last day im june im going to jump,1
im failing school have no talents and therefore dont do any extracurriculars live in a dysfunctional family that always fights and yells and even beats each other i have no friends and im in introvert who cant make any im diabetic and my crush recently humiliated me publicly when i confessed this world is fucking shit and im tired of it whoever said it gets better lied and im not sure how much longer i can do this ive been fighting my suicidal feelings for so long but it finally feels like im starting to fall to them,1
i didnt go through with it i didnt even have a plan i wrote it because i knew in that moment i wanted to end it all everything is collapsing around me and im disappointed i exist,1
i cant do this anymore this constant feeling of self hatred the dissociation the want to isolate ive shared my story many times without a single person noticing or helping ive dedicated so much of myself to helping others not feel the way i feel ive gone to therapy ive picked up hobbies and ive done all the things they say will cure depression yet here i am lying in bed having called out of work again i didnt think id ever feel this way again but i just want to die i want to disappear i want to be forgotten about ive gotten rid of all my friends my girlfriend just thinks im sick and i feel like i cant share my deepest feelings with her because of the stress she already goes through my parents dont speak with me i feel like if im not doing something for others they dont want me all this yet im too afraid to die its pretty pathetic,1
so i dont really know where to talk about this and even if no one reads this its okay so ive been struggling with depression and bpd for years now due to traumatic experiences ive had with my family mainly physical and mental abuse i still live with my mother who has caused a lot of pain i was told by a therapist to just accept her because i live here in which is the same way she dictates the household anyways so ive been dating my boyfriend for years and although ive seen to be getting better my mother and i had a physical altercation in which lead me to a downward spiral it caused problems in my relationship as i know i dont have the healthiest means of coping many time we would have arguments that i could not emotionally handle because my depression has been getting the best of me and i know i am to blame but bear with me my boyfriend and i had a fight because i snapped at him over the phone it wasnt his fault and i felt really bad so i apologised but he said i was just being unnecessary i said i was sorry for being unnecessary and he said he didnt care eventually he said he was over it and that we were okay but it left me feeling low because im not in the best of mind states i recently lost my job and been struggling to find another because not many places are looking at the moment and my mother has been on my head about it my mental state has been pretty low and im mostly disappointed in myself i tend to put myself down a lot as i really wanted more for myself i had a breakdown after our fight because i felt like i was being a burden to everyone including my boyfriend i said i felt worthless and that i was sorry he had ti deal with like this and overall just going over how i felt like life would be easier wo me he said that im always living in this self pity and that im never going to get better he said i work on his nerves paraphrasing because he said it much vulgar and that thats all i do lately in the middle of my break down and i just cried harder this was over a video call so after he said that he just watched me cry clearly annoyed i said we could end the call if the crying bothered him and he said just end it because im tired of you i really feel so broken and like every aspect of my life,1
apparently my depression is so severe that not even the most potent medication can cure it i still feel as depressed as i would be if i didnt take it i also dont even feel like trying to do anything anymore because im just gonna fail again for the millionth fucking time it never goes away it never stops,1
someone once told me three things i needed to learn in life number one nice guys finish last number two nice guys finish last number three you get the picture i wished i could be more selfish more callous more an ahole because it really sucks worrying about everybody else and trying to please people,1
i have a great job and a potential promotion happening very soon but everything else outside my career is so sad right now the only reason im still hanging on is because i dont want another failed attempt and to look like an assshole or lose my job my relationship is basically over my grandfather is dying in hospice with bone cancer and im slowly feeling like im spiraling even worse than before i have to hide it from everyone in my life because everyone has something else more important going on i really need to get to a psych and a therapist but scheduling feels impossible where i am located i feel like i need immediate help but i have no way to get that even if i could i wouldnt be able to get myself there because i cant afford a car and my credit sucks are there any temporary solutions to numb the pain until i can get myself help that will not continue to hurt everyone around me or cause for alarm what do you do to get through the days,1
i m dont want to continue this anymore i got out of a year relationship back in august i left cause i wasnt happy anymore and hated myself to the point of not loving her anymore i was lbs when we broke up and now im lbs i go to the gym for about hours a week sometimes more im stronger than my friends that got me into the gym and that makes me happy sometimes i see a therapist every other week and i dont even tell him about some of these deeperdown issues about not wanting to live anymore cause he is a school therapist and i worry that i would get a restriction on campus cause of it i have been on one date since the breakup and i really wasnt that interested in the girl i met her on an app and just went on a date so my parents would get off my back about not going on a date since the breakup i feel invisible to women im actually attracted to that in the gym or around campus i try to smile and make eye contact but i can count the times anyone has actually looked back and smiled on one hand i feel like my depression ruined my one chance at love and not im just a fat ugly person who is going to die alone no matter how much weight i lose no matter how much better i look i dont think it is ever going to get better i did get with my ex for a moment but i think my heart is truly empty there were no new feelings of love i think i need someone to kick start it i need someone new to care about the bring those feelings back i dont know how long i can continue this life i feel like my peak is going to be years from now when im still single and alone and graduate from school and am making k and have a nice scat pack challenger in the garage and my ram parked outside in a luxury one bedroom apartment im on the apps and i get like maybe likes total a week over all of the apps im using and i usually get ghosted after the first message since i updated my pictures recently i have been getting likes from much betterlooking girls and i dont even message them cause i feel like they look too good for me and probably swiped the wrong way and i dont want to message them and they ghost me cause they did swipe the wrong way i know that is the dumbest thing but its how i really feel you dont have to comment or say anything i think i really just need to type all this out and post it somewhere,1
none of the things i used to look forward to or would cheer me up even make me the tiniest bit excited to think about anymore i cant even think about staying alive for my animals too sad to even want to cryi just want to disappear ive never been so lowfunctioning in the decade ive been depressed all i do now is sleep idk why im even still trying to reach out to anyone tbh,1
im wanting to kms and i dont know what to do i asked my friend and he said i call dibs on your pc and i dont know what to do at this point,1
we both female have been together for years and married for during the course of our relationship she has had periods of non diagnosed depression well she did go to the doctors maybe years ago and got a few counselling sessions but never went back she can be fine for over a year and then something switches in her and she just shuts off this recent episode has been since last tuesday and she is pushing me away we have a day off planned tomorrow and she is telling me to go into work she sits up on her own drinking and listening to music she says things have changed between us yet only a few weeks ago we were immensely happy and texting each other how much we love each other yet she is saying we dont do anything and sit in silence i know this isnt true we go on lots of walks together we stayed overnight in a hotel and had a theatre trip at the beginning of the month i have been away with work for a few days and had a holiday with friends this month too she usually loves to make plans but is showing no interest in anything she also is quite on top with the house and is not really doing anything other than getting by she has issues with her mum who has treated her appallingly throughout her life and they are currently not speaking and she lost a close family member months ago so i know things are getting on top of her im petrified that she is going to end the relationship but i am trying to hide this and stay my usual upbeat self ive told her ill stick by her in whatever she needs she wont see a doctor or consider a therapist and i just dont know what to do she isnt very good at vocalising her emotions and just says she wishes she could have a break from her life for a month i suppose im looking for answers from people who have felt like this or had partners similar to this so i can figure out if she is just falling out of love with me or is this depression and we will recover sorry this is a bit all over the place,1
i have had countless changes in my life and came in terms with at some pointbut i myself changed a lot not in a good way thats what ill never recover from i wasnt the best with emotions of people that time but atleast i was happy and functional i have tied my worth to a lot of things which i no longer have that made me question worth relentlessly i think everyone deserves to be happy despite everything in life but i cant say it to myself all conditions are different for myself i deserve to starve if i dont do well i deserve to not meet anyone if i messed up somewhere i deserve to be treated like shit it took me a while to realise how i came to accept being treated badly by people i am working on myself but will i ever be able to get my old self back no im stuck with a version of myself who cares about everything except herself and it fucking sucks,1
im i will be in november and i havent done anything with my life im still at university because i reproved years and i still got more years hopefully to finish it i have no friends much less a girlfriend i used to hang out with my school friends till about but nowadays all of them have moved on with their lives at university i made no friends the first years and now is impossible because everyone already knows each other so there is no get to know each other moments not only that but because i fucked up so many times at university i lost access to the government grants and i must pay for university with my money which i dont even have because i dont have a job but even if i had one it wouldnt be enough i dont do anything the whole day nor do i talk with anyone i havent had a conversation with someone other than my family for about years im only eating once a day because im short on money i hate going outside because i dont have anything to do but i cant even watch a movie or play a video game because is just not fun anymore i often just keep opening and closing the movies or games now that im i just feel way too old to do most things and feel like i dont fit anywhere im not good looking and people just ignore me i feel like i just missed the boat on developing social relationships and its too late for me now,1
hi been prescribed zoloft for month now to treat depression that started after my tbi brain chemical all messed up now my period is weeks late and the home tests say negative anyone else have this issue ill get a test at the doctor in days,1
wtf am i supposed to do now,1
has anyone experienced something similar or is this just how my brain works i had been taking the antidepressants for less than three weeks and then decided to go cold turkey its like if i had a constant brain fog i cant concentrate nor do anything i wish i hadnt started taking them in the first place,1
i cant do anything i have energy for nothing i havent worked out for one year i cant maintain a routine sometimes i only have drinks for food nothing solid sometimes i spend the day without eating i developted pseudocushing as it seems and the only truly efficient method would be for me to work out but i get extremely tired after just minutes even if i eat healthy mind you im not morbidly obese nor do i have anything that prevents me from moving my body correctly sometimes after trying to exercise or after a day in which i move a lot i tend to sleep for more than hours straight the doctor told me about the possibility of having to give me venvanse if i dont get any better which is a more dangerous medicine for me im diagnosed with hypercortisolism pseudocushing depression anxiety ptsd and in the process of getting evalued for autism aspergers but ive never had symptoms of adhd or anything only some things that overlap with autism like sensory issues so im scared of getting addicted to it or not being able to get off of it at the same time i really want to have energy for stuff not motivation nobody needs motivation to do stuff i just want to not be lethargic all the time,1
going to be my last week of living cant be bothered if everything i do and people dont stay gonna head to this cliff i know in the morning and jump cant be bothered anymore been dwelling on my predicament since i was bullied ugly no friends and autistic complete loner year ahead went by still the same but found someone honline suppose not talking to anyone irl dew to social anxiety and self hatred left me in a pit of disappear suicide ideation what i did a few time almost fatal saw how my family reacted so i continue till im here they are enjoying life and i still feel out of place ive given it time and tried no one stays nor can i find a reason too gonna head to this cliff i know in the morning and jump cant be bothered anymore,1
i cant function anymore i dont get out of bed i can hardly get anything done it is too much day after day after day i sleep in dont show up to where im supposed to be i have no interest in things i used to enjoy and all they do is make me anxious everything feels like a burden i have no answer to why i dont show why i dont do nything on time i dont have any answers and i know none of this is gonna end well im gonna be in such deep trouble with my college my attendance they could hold my exams even for this i dont know what to do anymore i used to like to do stuff i used to enjoy but i dont anymore im so anxious that im not where im supposed to be and at the same time i just dont care my mind feels numb everything is a blur days are just passing by me and im just stuck im losing track of time im losing touch with friends and family im slipping away,1
im m broke ugly alone and single when i was in school i had something going for me i was smart top of my class good looking went to school for computer science and i ended up hating it after i dropped out at i worked job to job dropped of school again and now im a couple years out working for dollars an hour and starting to realize how much i ruined my life you need money and education to have any sort of chance in life you are better off not even going to college because once your a failure in life it consumes you in every aspect of life family wont treat you the same girls wont even give me a chance once they know and once you realize this you see life move without you what are you supposed to do if you cant make more money or have a girl to live for there actually is not reason to live your friends move on with there lives i truly feel like its over for me i know im exagerating but at the same time im not its over in the sense of ever being successful and happy i failed at the most important time in my life the days never get better they only get horribly worse so this is probably the end of the time for me,1
so i am a year old male i have had depression on and off my entire life more on than off but my off periods were fantastic i was capable of pure joy energy zest i could be the person that lights up a room sorry to toot my own horn i have always however had health anxiety worried about this and that many medical tests etc over the last year other than the months i was on zyprexa which i guess should be very telling i am exhausted beyond belief i am crying all the time i almost never feel wellrested i want to sleep all day but even when i try to nap i rarely fall asleep i just lie there and remain exhausted physically so exhausted last year i had a stupid pulmonologist sometimes they dabble in sleep medicine suggest to me that i had narcolepsy as a person with health anxiety this was terrifying i got separate medical opinions all of them from major universities they all said i didnt even close to have narcolepsy and that it was my depression causing it my tests overnight sleep study and daytime nap study werent close i didnt believe them i was in denial i think because i used to have times when i felt great and the depression lifted this had to be something different however if i try to look at things objectively i have to see that in the last year i have become a caretaker for my mother with als who is rapidly progressing i have become more isolated and hang out with friends less and havent been working on my passion music as much has anyone else gone through depression denial and tried to find a medical explanation for their somatic symptoms lethargy exhaustion brain fog crying all the time only to get every medical test in the book and have all doctors and friends and family that know you best and love you tell you its depression side note i went for a run while crying lol yesterday for the first time in two years and it totally took away my brain fog i still feel tired but i feel clearer that was new,1
ive always been known for my kindness and empathy and in my opinion that was the only thing good about me but lately ive been rude sometimes and making jokes who hurt other people without thinking about it my intention never was hurting them but i say what comes to my mind without thinking how it would affect others as a sensitive person i feel like a piece of shit because i would not like if the things i say were redirected to me thats i know they are rude im afraid im turning into a horrible person because im losing my common sense and its making me conscious because the moment i realize i did that i feel the worst person on earth i want to be a kind person again,1
i feel like shit i never rly knew how bad depression can get until now when ppl say they cant do any including bushing their teeth i never understood that feeling but now i get it i dont want to do anything i feel like breathing is painful i dont want to leave my bed i dont want to study i dont want to go to school i dont want to talk pplnot that i have anyone to talk to i cant even tell anyone cuz idk what to say i want to tell my bf but hes falling out of love and hes already going though it im asian so mental health isnt a thing in my house my finals are in a months that determine my college and i physically and mentally am so exhausted i think killing myself is much more easier then existing i cant eat i feel weak constantly i feel fat but also so light i just want to die,1
does anyone know why i feel like im suffocating if anyone knows can they please help me,1
i have asked this either on this reddit or another one a while back and never got a response i am a relatively healthy person although i dont have a set doctor or do yearly checkups or anything so i dont exactly know how i go about finding someone to give me a evaluation cause i definitely feel as if i have some really bad social anxiety and it has really been affecting my overall happiness but sitting around diagnosing myself doesnt exactly help the problem,1
i made a posthttpswwwredditcomrdepressioncommentsykdjjustthinkingaboutlifeutmsourceshareamputmmediumandroidappamputmnameandroidcssamputmtermamputmcontentsharebutton five years ago about some thoughts i had at the time reflecting back on them im surprised with how articulate my thoughts were back then more importantly the feelings i harbored have changed for the worse im still nave to the adult world im only but ive lost all my innocence by this point i think the hardest thing to do as an adult is maintain friendships and socialize even working was easier for me i still consider myself a failure in this all and ive lost hope by this point in any personal success its no longer fine ive stopped paying attention to the world outside its still broken and ive no hope that it will be in a better state in the future people will struggle at one point or another for varied lengths of time im still struggling im still a kid who never grew up im immature im not smart im not capable of great things ive wasted too much time thinking about useless things like what the future may hold and what purpose i have in this world this reality truly is tiring i still dont believe this reality is for me im not fine ive not been fine this whole time even though ive been doing my best to get through it all i still see suicide as my only way out and still struggle with ideation fearing that i wont be able to integrate into society like a normal person im still afraid to go through with suicide even though im physically hurting almost every day from living and i dont think ill ever be able to go through with suicide because of that fear i will forever be trapped here until i die from natural causes or an accident its become more difficult to live and i expect it to be even more difficult as time moves on i find it hard to get out of bed until hours later where i feel regretful for staying in bed for too long i dont have the motivation or strength to do things that would benefit me like showering consistently cleaning or eating meals i cant even push myself to find work i feel bad for telling people this stuff and i dont trust any professionals with this either i want to improve but i lose motivation easily i dont have anyone or a support group to keep me on my feet i cant do this by myself i dont know what to do next to make things better for myself,1
my problem is that i am lonely but also that i want nothing to do with other people i am permanently stuck in this conundrum i feel like i wasted the first years of my life and i am terminally behind socially and will never catch up part of me does not want to i am stuck in a never ending cycle of anxiety and sadness alcohol in the rare times ive used it calms me down it makes the anxiety surrounding my circumstances dissipate i dont see how making drinking a habit will worsen my life usually alcohol ruins your relationships but i already dont leave the house or have much human contact it stops you from solving your problems but i already am doing nothing about them it poisons your body physically but i dont care about my physical health it will hold you back in your career but i am already halfassing it at work i dont see how alcohol is going to make my problems worse,1
ive been waiting my whole life for things to get better ill be in july and just dont see the point no friends to talk to and only time my family calls me is when they need a babysitter only person i have to talk to is my therapist and while im grateful for her i feel incredibly lonely i feel like the only people who care about me is my mom and grandma my grandmas health is declining and while i appreciate my mom she only has time to talk when im having a breakdown everybody says things will get better but no one says what to do when they dont no one says what to do when you get so tired of waiting everybody just says better days are coming and youre supposed to believe it i wish with everything in me that i could be happy but that dream is light years away i wish i had guidance i wish being lonely didnt weigh so heavy on my heart,1
i want to kill myself but i am to afraid to do it i just dont want ot exist,1
everyday i repeat myself doing the same shit again n again i dont know whats going on inside my brain i can see its functioning like a system doing its thing but i clearly dont know what its doing and why im stuck inside it made me curious but i started thinking what if there is only one voice behind every person or any living thing on this planet like there is one spirit just experiencing itself of its variant energies in its own creation of all forms of life on this planet and that we are all one but part of the play how do i stop my consciousness its painful to be awake in our sleep we dont know where we go also forget we even have a body and that there is consciousness literally what am i thinking about anyway all this seems like a dream but the game is running slow one day the battery will drain out and i will finally experience the real me which i think is pure awarenessconsciousness of infinite energy,1
i contacted him in the hopes that he would let me stay with him so i can get a job in massachusetts since i dont like living in texas with my mom who is also abusive ive been texting him and he keeps demanding respect from me and said that me saying hey to him through is disrespectful and that i should call him sir even though he says hey to me whenever he calls me he thinks he has power over me despite me being hes currently renting and moving to an apartment in gloucester massachusetts with his other family members for us to live in i bought a mattress and a bed frame on amazon and shipped it to his address there today i asked him if he could take another picture of my mattress since it arrived a few days earlier and he blew up at me asking me why i dont trust him because my bed is already there and telling me i shouldnt disrespect him considering this interaction its pretty easy to tell that he would yell at me for the smallest thing if i went there it wouldnt surprise me if he hit me too hes like the last person i could rely on and it turns out hes just an angry piece of shit althought i should blame my mom for being a whore and cheating on her husband with my dad and bringing me into this hell everyone around me even other adults and therapists tell me that i need to forgive her because shes my mom despite her beating me since i was younger for no reason watching me get sexually assaulted as a child and making me believe this is all my fault ive been trying to be open minded but i cant help but believe that christians are all fucking disgusting pigs that shouldnt exist since my family is full of christians who do what they do for god i bought a rope a few days ago in hopes that id have the courage to hang myself but im scared my birthday is in days would it be better to try it then i might cause permanent damage to my throat if i fail have ti be hospitalized but its better to try then ill have the courage to end it all completely if anyone knows a good place or forest in fort worth texas where i can hang myself without anyone coming to my aid id appreciate that although i doubt many are gonna read this im kinda desperate as well cuz i said that i was going to kill myself to a suicide hotline person out of anger lol although its a good thing i used a fake name but if they arrive to my house and figure out its me theyll throw me in a psych ward again instead of the person who ruined my life i dont want know if i want to go to massachusetts anymore i just cant take any of this seriously anymore i had another account where id make posts begging for someone to kill me or rpe me in hopes that some deranged human being would agree but ive had no luck if you want to motivate me to end my life please dm me,1

ive been unemployed for months im k in credit card debt ive been dealing with severe depression amp anxiety and inter generational trauma for my entire life ive been doing my best to apply myself these last few months and despite my best efforts i just end up at rock bottom time and time again i have no motivation no desires and time feels like its just passing by in the most painful way life feels like one giant blur and nothing feels like it matters medication wont work and my therapist helps but at the end of the day he can only so much so what to do every day i wake up and feel time pass by hour after hour as i sit on the couch the first couple of months i went on walks cooked read journaled hung out with friends but after months i kind of just wish i were dead living life in this meaningless unfulfilling way is so pathetic and i dont want it anymore,1
i think they might help me but im just awful at sticking to taking meds i start off taking them everyday for maybe a week then i quickly fall off and start forgetting to take them im not avoiding them i literally forget that im even on medication plus medication in general tastes horrible or the pills are huge and get stuck in my throat and just hurt going down in general so i almost prefer to forget and even when i manage to finish a whole bottle it doesnt do my lazinessmotivation any good because i will then procrastinate asking my doctor for a refill and procrastinate going to the pharmacy or sometimes i dont feel like taking my money and spending it on meds that week or something always comes up and the longer i put off refilling the meds is more time my body is without the meds and whatever effects they mightve been having are never able to reach their full potential and for the short time that i take these meds i dont see much change in terms of helping or even side effects they may as well be placebo and since i get no benefit in the short term it makes it hard to stick with in the long term im not motivated enough to keep taking them i can never stay consistent with medication which makes it difficult to even get better i just feel hopeless i have all these problems but cant stay consistent with the possible solutions to help me and always end up back at square one,1

hey all im getting worse ive been battling depression ever since i finished high school and its been progressively getting worse i thought getting a girlfriend would fix it it doesnt nothing seems to help ive come to realize life is pointless and it doesnt matter what i do to myself ive been hurting myself cutting etc and lately ive started drinking it started with just a couple of nights of drinking on holiday then i realized hey i kind of like alcohol started to have a couple of beers a few times a week now im having them every night and bought my first large case of them just in case i wanna have some beers the next night i know this is a step to the worse and that i could stop right now with minimal discomfort i just really dont care anymore and i want someone to notice im not okay because i cant really talk about it myself to the people i know at the same time i dont want this to turn into full blown alcoholism because that would be bad but at the same time i dont know if i even care that much anymore if i didnt have my family i would more than likely end my life thank u for reading this far i just needed some outlet and if anyone has words of comfort ill happily hear them,1
i was made fun of over my appearance ever since i was young i was just a child and had poor self esteem and confidence even though i didnt know about those concepts yet i was afraid to interact with others and felt like everywhere i went people were laughing at me this lasted all the way until i graduated high school years of maturing and some plastic surgery later i dont feel as self conscious but the damage has been done i hate myself i feel grotesque and worthless i want to die so that i stop feeling this way i constantly wonder why the universe would allow me to come into this world and live like this am i being punished for something i did in my past life i have tried therapy but the relief was only brief i would take a picture or catch my reflection at a different angle and be reminded just how ugly i am i want to accept it but its so hard i find myself mourning my younger self and it makes me even more depressed to know that there was no hope for me from the start,1

i screwed up for the past years depression and anxiety hit me hard on and off due to loneliness and the want for a relationship the past years iv been on and off several dating apps with zero success adding to my depression fast forward to just over a week ago and i finally match with a girl in my own town we talk for a week and exchange snap that day i finally meet her at a slight house gathering party and im up all night talking and having a laugh for the first time in what i felt like was forever then last night i did something incredibly stupid we had been talking pretty much non stop on snap ever since and she goes to a local pub with her friends and stops replying to me fair enough she can have fun then sends me a snap saying shes going to some friends house and half an hour later another snap of her extremely drunk on the toilet saying im fucked and i immediately start to worry i ask if she is ok if she is safe and has people with her and she doesnt reply i try to call times with no answer then minutes later she sends a very inaudable snap that i dont even know what she was saying almost spitting saliva everywhere and my worry gets worse for some reason in my manic worry i decided to get in my car and go to the house we met in origionaly because i didnt know where she was and they might have turns out she was there and in her extremely drunken state was wondering why i there when she was just trying to have some fun i tried to explain but she just wouldnt listen i apologized this morning but even though she said she still wanted to talk to me she has been very distant and not messaged me back all day i feel like i just want to curl up and sleep everything feels weak and even i can hear my voice sounds literally depressed when i try to talk to someone idk what to do,1
food does not taste good the sunshine doesnt warm my skin as it used to exercise leaves me only drained not satisfied i cannot live properly but i cannot die i have a loving family and i cannot do that to them i am hanging in a superposition a hell of routine that is not longer designed for me but for who i used to be my study turned my passion into mindless work i am too broke and too far down the study to stop it now i have one year left therapy does not help and i do not trust depression meds i am lonely surrounded by people what does one do when negativity takes over i was told depression means i am not in the right place that my lifestyle needs to change yeti am barely managing to do the little i am doing i am trying to take responsibility for my situation and change what i can control butit all falls short i feel like i am chasing something but even when i stop and appreciate the moments it is just a fleeting break from the endless torture it feels that the world is going mad each year they discover something else that we humans broke from microplastics carbon emissions to the impending doom of nuclear war i would say that i am losing hope but i am already hopeless yetthis is not how i felt just a few days ago it comes and goes for a few days i feel like a human and then i plunge back into this torture like on a rollercoaster i am pushing away the little friends that i have because if i stay silent then they still feel somethings up and when i open up they just dont like the negativity i dont even know why i am writing this post just to kill time before it finally kills me,1
if you dont like playing some game you simply click a button and leave it if you dont enjoy being at some random party you just go home do you see where im going with this this life is the same fking thing its just an experience its nothing special its not what all these people are making of it literally this life is utterly miserable objectively for the majority of people and i dont care if some minority gets to enjoy this life and squeeze max pleasure from it if i dont want to be here than its fking obvious that im not obligated by anything to continue to stay here and its not only about me not wanting to continue its about this life being such a fking terrible painful shit that its unbearable to even exist there something or someone clearly designed this life this certain way so that we cant leave this life any moment without pain without fear without any aftermath whatsoever they even called it death and gave us this stereotype that death is so dramatic its so scary its so bad you should survive and avoid it like its objective truth that if everyone had an ability to simply end this life whenever they want nobody would be depressed there would be no suffering no misery we wouldnt even have this conversation i mean imagine even having to fking talk about this miserable shit i mean existence should be about having fun to be happy to have beautiful memories not to be stuck in this shit and wondering what the actual fk is this there is not one asshole that will tell me that i should live this life if i dont want i would beat the shit out of any bitch that would hesitate to even suggest to me that i should do something that i dont fking want i know exactly what i feel inside and its just billions time stronger and more powerful and makes much more sense than any kind of shit that this world propagates even if billion people will scream at me that im worthless piece of shit just because i dont care about this life i would give a single fuck because i know that im right i know for sure that no sentient conscious being with empathy and logic would even suggest that this abomination what we call life is great,1
hello today i m fully realized that i cannot function properly as a human being unless im directly seeking acceptance in others this translates to me not showering not brushing my teeth not shaving not even washing my hands when no one is going to see that i am clean and normal i recently started college ive been making friends and generally having a great time this if u look at it from the outside inside my head i just cannot get the sense out of my mind that someone is going to think less of me and criticize me physically because of my clothes my face my hair because i have a gray shadow even after just minutes of shaving because somehow i smell bad etc i have crippling anxiety just thinking about someone criticizing my looks in their heads and dont let me start with my personality basically all this converts into me having a sort of double life when i need to go outside i do all the work i can possibly do to try and look nice smell good and be a nice person but the moment im in my home my mind unconsciously switches to a gross side i dont take care of myself in any way type or form suddenly i am mean lazy antisocial and want to die once again the cycle repeats day after day ive been trying to make myself go to the gym and eat better for months now but my body just doesnt respond every fiber of my mind tells me that i cant do anything right i will always be kinda ugly kinda fat and kinda gross so why bother trying maybe nothing of this makes any sense sorry english is not my first language and im just trying to cope somehow,1
when i was unemployed my life had no structure the only reason i ever did anything besides rot in bed was my cat now that i have a remote job this is all i do i just exist my week is a blur my weekends are sad and structureless i have nothing else i dont talk to anyone except my parents because i live at home another reason for my misery today my boss met with me to talk about my long term goals meanwhile all day every day all i can think about is leaving this earth how can i think long term if i dont even know how to get through each day anymore all i want is a way out i had to be so fake and act enthusiastic it hurts so much,1
those questions about what drives you what makes you passionate theyre going to keep me unemployed i cant even fake an answer literally dont know what to say,1
when i was i had moved out because i has a strained relationship with my family i moved away because i wanted to put distance so that the relationship could be repaired i ended up moving across state lines and then eventually moved down south halfway across the country at my fathers suggestion for an easier life while i worked and got my degree and the distance did exactly what i wanted it showed my parents that i was strong and capable and mature and that i was an adult but it also created a great longing for home life was easier i got a better job i bought a house and i live comfortably with my husband but we dont like it here we like the small city the restaurants the proximity the healthcare etc but the environment and climate do not align with us we are northerners at heart we like the seasons fall and winter the hills the mountains the streams winding through the forest we miss it so dearly it hurts sometimes but i also miss my family i miss my parents my brother my nephew i miss my childhood best friend and her family i am heartbroken seeing years pass and i am missing from their daily life and they are missing from mine i am just incredibly lonely here and i want to be with them there has always been an obstacle preventing us from moving back but the biggest one being how expensive it is there and we would have struggled unless we were finished school and in our wellplaying fields so years pass by and we stay here while wishing we there well now my parents are getting older approaching their s they want to retire but they dont want to retire there they want to retire in the state im currently in so then becomes a new dilemma do i stay in this state that doesnt make me happy so i can be with my parents and potentially my brother in time do i move back home and enjoy my brothers company for as long as i have it i have my friends my climate and my job either way im giving up something that feels nonnegotiable for my complete happiness im overcome with this intense sadness that ive spent all the years where i could have had it all being away and now they are gone and i feel as if the life i have worked so hard in my degree and in life to get back to is gone ive tried talking to my family about staying in their current state or maybe moving to another state that i know they love and enjoy and that we do as well and they dont budge this is their plan i feel selfish when i push too hard i dont know what to do im overwhelmed with sadness i just accepted a job in my career because i just graduated but its even further south and even though its an amazing career opportunity i feel like its a step backward in the life i wanted,1
i am a year old student in college studying in computer science who despite being in his th semester is still stuck in the nd i am unable to make any lasting connections with any other students ive met during those semesters the only people i talk too are people i have been friends with in high school and their friends this is our last semester together has the have chosen a pre university to then follow their ambitions and have the job they wanted i have become so tired and hopeless that i am just barely following the classes anymore and recently i started not going to any of them if its one of those days i never thought i would make it past honestly and im even more surprised that i havent gotten to courage to attempt to end myself again i am just so tired of all of this all the things that i used to love means literally nothing to me i keep getting overwhelmed by everything at the middle of the semester i keep self sabotaging so bad that i just lay in bed all day or do nothing productive at all ive never seen myself in a future where i could be happy with the others and ive lost all my hopes and dreams over the years i have developed the worse eating habits as well as letting my negative self talk become louder and louder to the point when sometimes when i wake up im already defeated by it so i see no point in getting out of bed or do anything at all why even bother if its pointless anyway i dont even get why i am becoming like this i barely understand how i feel how think or what the hell i am even doing i thought i could prove my thoughts wrong by proving that i could do stuff but im coming close and closer to accomplishing another self fulfilling prophecy each time thinking about death being the only way out of this since its the only way to stop existing although i think this is true i know deep down that its also a lie i envy those who can just wake up go through life and enjoy it idk how they do it but i wish i could experience it just being alive for once being human without ruining everything that i do i want to be able to convey emotions again cry instead of blocking all of this sadness in my throat without having to bottle everything up until i breakdown be angery at stuff due to how wrong some of them are be happy and have way more better days than what i am having rn and laugh at how everything is just absurd with other people i dont want to stay as this subhuman filth that i have become but every step i take takes me to nowhere so i am just here standing still while watching everything else moving forward,1
i have a situation that i wont go too much detail but ill probably write a lot about it my gfnow ex ended things last weekend because of her severe depression after she was crying about everything and didnt want to put me through it she told me she always pushes everyone away she lost her two year old boy three years ago and never got help to grieve we also found she miscarried just before the weekend too however before this she told me she was not wanting the baby the day after this happened i shut myself off from my phone and apparently she tried to contact me raced around to my apartment and was shaking giving me a big hug thinking id done something to myself wasnt my intention since then ive felt down about it i made it clear to her that i want her but i understand that isnt important right now and her getting better is key that i would stick by her no matter what she appreciated this and said lets see what the future holds but that she needs space between us i agreed and respected this she also said she still loves me she came over a couple of days ago and i was on the phone to customer service when she spoke to them they asked who she was and she said his partner which confused me she invited me to ikea after i finished work so i could help her with buying stuff we went and got some food and overall we had a laugh like our earlier days im trying to give her space but she keeps contacting me about things in the apartment etc her mum had asked me to reset some laptops for her but i was given no deadline and had been very busy lately my ex tried to call me multiple times this morning about the laptops but i was working i called her on my break and she was very aggressive on the phone i mentioned doing this as a favour but she called me an inconsiderate cnt because of what her mum had done for me she also complained at me that if it wasnt for her nothing would have got done in our apartment and that she was in there today sorting stuff what originally caused her to leave our apartment and go back to her mums were these low moments shed have lashing out because of her depression my issue was id react to it turn it into something more and walk out the room so when she was being like this on the phone i wanted to be the opposite and tell her itll be okay and ill sort it she spiralled into a meltdown with me and hung up i sent a message after saying itll be sorted tonight and ill drop the laptops off that i do appreciate everything her and her mum have done i just dont know what to do i feel like this is a further step back and she now hates me she seemed to be warming back up to me when we were at ikea i still want to be there and support her when she needs me but i feel like after this depression aside why would she even want to consider making a go of things with someone she sees as inconsiderate dragging feet etc i plan to keep giving her space until she reaches out again but i keep thinking that in the long term ive severed any chance of her returning i want to show her im not like that just ive had to juggle everything so im finding it difficult to complete jobs she wants alongside balancing my own life i want to support her through her depression so much i love her but it just feels like she hates me right now,1
i cant fucking take this anymore,1
i don have no idea what to do,1
starting to become a deeply resentful person and i hate myself for that,1
ive forgotten who i was before all my memories feel like faded recollections of a dream i had ages ago i dont have much of a personality anymore or opinions on anything i feel like a child ghost among human adults pretending to fit in maybe i should just forget about it all and try to become someone new but im scared and i dont want to completely lose myself,1
i made plans to end my life this week i didnt get to bc my partner has been here and i know hes not going to let me and im not sure if its because i cant get it over with him here or the depression itself but ive been really irritable his jokes arent funny anymore i get visceral when he play fights with me i get so angry at him i want to cry and be violent it just sucks because he was the absolute last thing thats brought me any type joy these pasts few weeks i guess it really is time to go i cant continue this miserable existence for much longer and i truly dont plan to,1
i dont know what to do anymore i have no friends no family when it comes to trying being strong i do i really do try but when one succumbs to his own mental thoughts it can be detrimental how one perceives life im currently homeless and have no one to rely on except myself even though im homeless i do have a job and want a future for myself but sometimes its to difficult to move onand im taking about mentally being surrounded by your own thoughts can be detrimental to ones health,1
they all leave they say they are there for people but when you actually are in that place they say nothing and stop talking to you it is so hard to struggle every single day and to have people see you struggling but choose to do and say nothing they say open up to us when i do they explain it away depression is hard because yoy are completely alone its like being stuck in a desert theres no hope and no respite just death,1
so my prior job turned extremely toxic back in november due to new management it devastated my already shitty mental health in january i couldnt take it anymore so i quit im years old and i have a mortgage and i live alone with my dog theres no money coming in and my house payment is days late ive tried getting a new job but due to my depression i can barely make myself go to the mailbox and get the mail more than once per week ive only left my house once in the last months ive had interviews lined up but i couldnt make myself go so a couple weeks ago i had the idea to start a business i failed to get any investors so i said fuck it and started using my credit cards to buy the tools and equipment i need im currently just about out of money and im nowhere near ready to start the business making and selling things basically is the business model ive been really starting to feel the full weight of this decision and the pressure to not fail is insane i dont know what to do if i fail ive had plenty of suicidal thoughts since back in november but i was able to push them away my dog and my dad he lives in another state and has health issues and hes pushing are the only things keeping me from swallowing the old bottle of ambien in my cupboard pulling my car into the garage and just letting it all go the part of me that wants to live is getting smaller everyday ive discussed all this with my therapist and one friend but even then i have a habit of sugar coating things i just dont know what to do i feel broken and empty inside out of nowhere ill just break down and cry i cant remember the last time i thought hey maybe things are gonna be ok i guess thats the end of my rant thanks for reading this far take care everyone,1
i dont know why im on here guess i just needed to get it out of my system i think im finally done done trying to be okay i just want it to stop everything im trying so hard to protect my peace but is just not working anymore trying to rebuild myself into a better me trying to find my spark again but im just done i dont have the energy for it anymore i dont know what im doing anymore im trying my best to take care of myself eating better and making sure im taking care of my body sleeping good hours and taking my meds but its just not worth it anymore im so disgusted in myself im so disgusted that i dont want to keep fighting for everyone i love i dont want my family and friends to experience me just leaving i dont want to put that pain on them i dont want my little sister to grow up without me i dont want her to not understand why i dont come to visit her anymore i want to be there when she has her first partner her first heartbreakwhen she gets her license gets married and has her first kid of her own i dont want her to ever know what its like to loose someone like this i fucking love everyone but ive just tired everything psychs meds spiritual journeys taking it one day at a time nothing works i just cant do it anymore im fucking exhausted,1
forgive me if the title is graphic but i cant tell who i am anymore if the voices are me and why theyre all so different and treat me like this whole other person i cant tell what kind of person i am and im losing myself it feels like my mind has shattered and my body is being shared by the different people in my head where did i go is this me who feels this way,1
i have intention of living ive never been able to view life the way others view it and therefore never really enjoyed much in life to begin with after cracking my brain for countless of nights i still cant come up with whats stopping me for doing it this may come off as me being ungratefulselfish for my familyfriends but i cant live this life any longer just for them it has already gotten to a point where theyre starting to blame themselves for how ive turned out and its just not fair to them yet despite knowing all of this and wanting to die with all my heart i still dont have what it take to do it i cant even wrap my head around how pathetically weak my mind iscant i just do something right for once,1
ive been in community college for a few semesters i was finally gonna go to my dream college this fall but i needed a scholarship to afford it i worked really hard i got extremely high marks good enough that my professors here gave me early congratulations yet i just got the news today that i got nothing i wont be able to afford it i cant go and its a pretty hopeless field without a good degree i just feel so broken and lost no idea what i did wrong or what else i could have done i was finally starting to feel better about my life and now i have no trajectory again i dont even want to finish my current semester im just done its over,1
i was struggling with depression for years and i got out of it by going to therapy making lifestyle choices and shifting into a mindset of i deserve taking care of myself i still had a lot of anxiety and insecurity but i could at least moderately function and feel joy and happiness im feeling myself slip back into depression partially due to a lack of fulfillmentaccomplishment at my job a long with realizing that im not living up to my very high expectations on a personal level any tips for not falling in the hole i know that every day i dont do anything about it will make it so much harder to get back to a normal level of functioning,1
i woke up over stimulated today i dont have the energy to even explain why im so angry and tired of everything we dont have money they cut the benifits on our food stamps from the pandemic help thingy now we can barley feed ourselves and its not a matter of reapplying that wont fix that i need to get a job but no one is hiring i dont have a license because no one has the time to take me to take the test i love with my mom and little brother who both have health issues especially my mom im afraid to leave them alone because if something happened while i was gone that would be my worst nightmare but its looking like i need to get a job somewhere close by where i live get my mom to sit down and reapply for social security she keeps putting it off it more infuriating and new ways i just feel strongly about closing my eyes and just disappearing i think that would be nice but i cant so im happy that people think its so easy from the outside looking in that im just complaining for nothing that im lazy and scared that i need to grow up trying going from a family of to a family of three in a matter of months and see how you deal with those deaths and traumas i started a new medication wellbutrin idk what to think of it yet its only been days but i already feel so angry that always happens when i try to take depression medication it makes me manic and angry more easily irritated i guess idk im just tired of people talking to me about my life like im a clueless child like i havent already tried all the obvious answers over and over and over again like in a fucking idiot,1
as the days go on the more i think about everything thats happened in the past years i can honestly say that i regret being so weak i absolutely despise the moment in my life when i let my feelings take over telling myself it was okay to cry when shit got tough telling myself it was okay to shut down for a little this world has shown me that itll never stops kicking you even when your down and having to learn how to be strong again has been a journey trying to better myself hasnt been easy and i know that as life goes on it wont get any easier,1
i cant do this again,1
so my partner recently got diagnosed with cancer hell be ok with treatment but still awful i went the docs amp got back on meds as the stress was crippling me now all i want to do is sleep or punch things i feel so angry all the time which really isnt me amp i hate it everyone around me has noticed the change in me amp said something which make me feel terrible im just ranting because i dont know what else to do,1
ive been struggling with severe depression for a long timei had a traumatic childhood my parents didnt had any kind of love and were always shouting and fighting i was always alone and nobody wanted to go out with me watch a movie with me or spend time with me now i suffer from multiple personality disorder its getting so severe now its like one moment im very calm talking and greeting people nicely with a huge smile and always willing to help but as soon as i see anyone happy i literally get terribly rude and feel like choking the life out of them in this personality i literally feel like unaliving people as if i would really enjoy it its getting so bad now that others have started to notice am i becoming a psychopath what can i do i feel like im living on a limited time,1
hello im in menopause with teenagers one in crisis thats been going on for at least a year my husband travels frequently so its hard to depend on him for daily hands on support but he is very supportive otherwise im taking wellbutrin for sad but im now considering staying on it for the time being in the past two weeks my teenager in crisis has needed much more support than usual which is incredibly draining and stressful for me despite the fact they have a good team in place ive noticed that my muscles have become somewhat frozen like i cant really move about like before and a bit achy i dont have a temp or covidjust wondering if this typical of depression,1
have you ever felt like that i dont fit into any friend group and im very extroverted but somehow i dont have any friends and ive felt this way since i was im now makes me sad seeing everyone going out with friends with genuine connections knowing ill most likely never have that at this point i think its me i would catch myself in middlehigh school going from friend group to friend group sometimes eating lunch by myself that makes me feel like a total loser,1
thats it im tired of living like this im tired of how much energy and restraint it takes for me to not just end it all i think its time to let it go and accept its over for me,1
i dont have any strength in me,1
ever since i f was younger i struggled with emotions id cry whenever frustrated or angry and still do to this day my parents would often say i was a drama queen for this reason kids would also talk about me being overly sensitive and crying too much but i was genuinely hurt nowadays whenever im sad or cry those memories get in my head and i convince myself that im faking it like my feelings arent genuine like i am doing it for attention even if i am genuinely hurt i feel like i cant trust myself i struggle with ocd depression and anxiety im taking buspar for anxiety ashwaganda and did some ocd therapy for about months weekly the ocd aspect somewhat improved however my depression has skyrocketed ive always been able to make friends easily however it wasnt because of my personality but the way i can match others energy i can get every guy to like me not because they like me but because im easy to talk to i feel like i dont even have an identity a personality i dont feel like a person and therefore dont feel deserving of love or anything i struggle with being insecure sometimes as well in eighth grade these boys who i thought were friends of mine came behind my chair and repeatedly called me ugly until i cried that moment haunts me forever another moment i love my mom to pieces but something she said killed me i was a rotten girl growing up again i was mad at the world i felt no one understood me i had a strict dad who is emotionally unavailable and a helicopter mom not like this anymore we are best friends now they again would always make incidents my fault for being too sensitive one time i went too far with being a rotten preteen and my mom said you know i used to always dream of having a daughter and now that i have you this is not what i wanted along those lines heartbreaking to hear all of these experiences have made me feel like no one like im empty like no one really cares for me my family doesnt even care to talk about what i learned at university the place where i spend hours a week at i feel somewhat invisible i feel empty but so full of sadness i lack empathy and feel awkward when others express their emotions i want to be happier and feel joy and excitement and empathy and i just cant i feel broken i have friends and supportive family they know i struggle but they dont know how bad i cant afford to break down everyday i feel traumatized by life and feel unmotivated to keep moving forward i wont do anything to end it im expressing its really really hard for me right now i just want to know is this forever side note only hobby i have time for is exercise atm,1
my therapist f and i f havent spoken in a long time in the end of our last appointments she always said she would message me a date for our next session later but she didnt text me this happened at least times and i only got my next appointment when i texted her since im in therapy for years or so she kinda became my second mum and it hurt every time she forgot to give me a new appointment i always had a really good connection to her and it clicked the second i saw her as i said we havent spoken in a long time now because im hurt and dont really want to go to her anymore i dont want to look for another therapist either bc its exhausting to talk about all of the trauma again so i wait till i can go to the clinic in a few weeks what would you do in my situation if you think i should talk to her about it how do i do it,1
my current life is nothing but constant lonely monotony and working all the time and i fear thats how the rest of my life will be ive fantasized about gathering up all of my savings booking a trip to vegas staying in a nice airbnb and having as much fun in sin city as i can for a week before i end it all i need at least one last good adventure that i can look back on and be proud of id rather spend the last week of my life living it to the fullest than spend the rest of my life in depressing monotony,1
dear world i am writing this note with a heavy heart seeking and begging for your forgiveness for my pathetic and weak existence i am sorry for the pain and disappointment i may have caused you all through my cowardly acts and weak display of character my entire life has been a complete failure i have been consumed by fear selfdoubt and discouragement that it has rendered me powerless in almost all aspects of my life i have tried so hard to fit in and be accepted but it seems like no matter how much i try my efforts are always not good enough i am sorry for all the times i let you down for all the opportunities i squandered and wasted because i was too timid to seize the moment i am sorry for all the people whose trust and love i lost because i could not face my shortcomings i know that taking my own life is not the solution but i cannot bear the pain and the emptiness that i feel inside anymore i cannot bear living in this world that expects too much from me when i clearly cannot deliver i hope that one day you can find it in your hearts to forgive me for my cowardice and inadequacy i hope that you can move past my shortcomings and failures and remember me for the good that i once was to my family friends and loved ones i am sorry that i couldnt be the strong and dependable person that you deserved i hope that my death brings you some form of closure and relief from the burden that i have become in your lives i will leave this world with a prayer in my heart that one day the world will be a better place where acceptance kindness and love abound may nobody else ever feel the isolation and pain that i have felt during my life i hope that when i am gone the world becomes brighter and filled with more hope and happiness goodbye world please forgive me yours sincerely liam,1
i think im finally ready to kill myself im not scared of going to hell anymore,1
,1
i know that taking an nsaid with an ssri is not advised but given that do any of you still take something like ibuprofen or naproxen anyway im not asking because i plan to use the comments as a permission slip for me to do the same im going to ask my doctors and work with them i suffer from back pain and naproxen is super effective for me id like to restart zoloft but im concerned about the impact on my health when used with an nsaid i have a couple of doc visits scheduled to see what they can do for me and if there is any way i can do this safely or with minimal risk but in the meantime im curious what your experience is does your doc make you do blood work every so often while you take an nsaid did they put you on a different med do you just stick it out during pain and not take those types of drugs do you do physical therapy etc im aware there are other pain meds out there such as tylenol but im asking specifically about nsaids due to their antiinflammatory effects,1
im suicidal well i havent self harmed so it mustnt be bad ive started self harming i havent gone deep enough so it mustnt be bad love that,1
im in a depressive episode ive already used gout as an excuse this time im using a concussion as an excuse clearly im not comfortable sharing my mental health does anyone else have a go to excuse,1
im trying to find a girlfriend because i want to settle down but its impossible i met a girl who loves two hours from be but of course its going nowhere per usual i hate life i do not want to end up forever alone but thats how i feel,1
been depressed since i was years old its been years and my family still thinks its a phase i dont understand why i havent died yet because i dont have a reason to be here except to rot away,1
i dont have it in me to do absolutely anything in my life not even kill myself but if i wasnt so broken maybe i wouldnt need or want to what a fucking curse,1
conflicted self inflicted misery has made me numb i thrive off academic validation having become stagnant in every way possible and unreachable has made me cold hearted the only way to numb the non reluctant pain is through expressive amount of work at all times ive had depression for ten years and have the diagnoses of chronic depression being a remarkable student doesnt fix the pain it numbs it if i dont indulge in work then my depression hits filling my brain with work excludes me from killing myself the amount of work does at least give me an accommodating future being caught up in this misery of perfectionism is ruining me what i fear most is summer vacation i cant stand vacation the time where i drive myself nuts on my own signing up for lecture after lecture i really am in misery but i am too numb to cry i am waiting for vacations so that i can work myself to an extent just over manageable an extent that makes people worried if they knew even though people only see a little glimpse of my sickness i am very very sick i am aware but also so sick that ill always keep going,1
i recovered from my depressive episode years ago i was actually happy for a long time now im back here and i cant believe it i cant do it again i just cant,1
i been having a tough two years because of a really bad break up that made me question my life and worth i feel like i dont really belong here they keep telling me it gets better and ill find someone better but it hasnt i feel alone im a background friend and ill always be a second thought i want to disappear but i cant seem to do it because i have a twin we do everything together work together vent to each other i would hate to have to leave him alone in the world without his other half im scared how hell have to plan my funeral and bury me to have him cry for me and tell people i had a twin or be around our coworkers and he wont enjoy his job because he used to see me walk around i cant do it ill just keep holding on,1
i am the happygolucky type of person i have a good life with a fantastic wife a very nice house a lovely dog and a great car i have no financial issues either actually you could say that im pretty rich in life financial but mostly generally in life also i am reasonably healthy i need to work out for some stamina but i hardly have any overweight dont smoke dont drink i eat healthy sounds great right i was burnt out in because i worked for many years and even though it feels like the burnout is mostly gone i cant really get myself to do anything and its starting to get to me i am feeling frustrated about it more and more honestly dont feel like i am depressed i feel happy and mostly relaxed wo anxiety i am absolutely motivated to do a lot of things both in the work and private spectrum maybe i even want to do too much stuff i really want to do all the things in my head and achieve new goals but i sit on the couch and then when i want to start with something i just cant get myself to do it and when i do i dont finish it examples are typically i have some great online business ideas and i can start them all myself from my home office i start the projects but i never finish i have a great gym at home and i want to work out at least a few times a week but i just dont do it daily tasks are not an issue and i do them with pleasure eg cooking cleaning administrative tasks garden work etc its not a problem at all i am guessing because they are small isolated tasks that i can finish and then move on anyway i had intakes with a couple of therapists and they all say that they think i seem very good and not depressed that i should do more fitness and are not sure they can help me any further and even though theyre right i should get more fit but i really doubt thats what is keeping me from actually doingfinishing things maybe its just the last burnout issues i am experiencing or is something else depression anyway or something related thoughts,1
theres nothing for me,1
i m am at my lowest point in life its been years since my brother died and i still think about him every fucking day i have a gf who cuts herself and has her own issues i dont know how to help her since she does not want to seek professional help i have zero motivation at school and have lost all my friends not sure why i dont want to kill myself but i just want to sleep forever im so tired of pretending im fine when im fucking not its been like this for some time i thought it was a phase and that it would pass but it just keeps getting fucking worse and worse every fucking expression i make is just a mask hiding how fucking horrible i feel i dont remember the last time i truly felt happy about life,1
i am years old and suffering from depression for a few years i am unemployed and having gender identity issues i honestly am trying a lot harder to get better but today is one of those days where i am alone and want to commit suicide i feel like a complete loser since i have no friends available anymore i hated college and every job ive ever had i feel there is no place for me in this world i want to live and meet my online partner but thats pretty far off and doesnt stop the fact i am a poor loser with depression and nothing going for me can anyone help me im just wanting to die a lot and im trying to get it to go away by it never does long im pushing people i used to know away more and more i went to highschool with them i know they dont care so im removing them all from my life my family wouldnt support me if i was trans ive dropped hints and they all shut me down and tell me im not or that they would be disappointed in me im on meds and in therapy i want to kill myself nearly everyday my mom said if i go back to the hospital again or cut myself she would send me to live with my grandma because she cant deal with the stress of me being depressed and she cant watch me all the time what do i do,1
ill be honest i was buzzed and didnt know what i was doing at first its like you dont try to stop the intrusive thoughts anymore for a while i was at peace next thing i know i was on my bathroom floor deeply cutting myself on the wrist and arm a few times some were just light slashes that werent deep at all once i realized that i actually had to deal with all the wounds and the mess its like my brain had just stopped i frantically tried to treat myself and clean the blood off the floor because it was so damn horrifying and painful but after a half assed job i got so tired and slept i woke up dreading to find out if last night was actually real i couldnt sleep properly the next few days and got real sick right now i have some energy but honestly i just want to sleep forever,1
okay this may seem like a dumb question to a lot of you but just hear me out and please keep the judgement to a minimum im sharing this because i genuinely want to change for the better after living like this for years for a little background i grew up in a household where my mother and i werent on the best terms and all she did as i grew up was work occasionally and sleep in bed all day long microwave dinners were a regular thing for me and my brothers i did pretty bad in school blah blah blah the big thing was i was never taught good hygiene as a kid it was never required or encouraged enforced i grew up and went through high school without showering regularly doing assignments or even engaging with many people outside of school because my mom didnt allow me to get out of the house much id spend my time playing games reading and a loooot of media dont get me wrong i wasnt a weird smelly kid in highschool surprisingly with the whole shower thing i didnt sweat or anything and always used deodorant and perfume clean clothes etc i had a lot of friends that i talked to daily up until senior year my senior year was when covid hit and everyone was in quarantine when school started back up i never went because it was online that same year i moved in with a new bf and his dad and uncle and since i was so accustomed to staying in a room all day without socializing or doing anything thats what i did there i dropped out of highschool and lived with my new boyfriend at the time for two years and to this i realized that i still never leave the room i stay in even when my bf has a job that requires him to travel for work i stay in the hotel room still having horrible hygiene habits although again not smelling bad or anything and consuming lots of media from the bed id have moments where come to the realization that lve spent days weeks then months doing the exact same thing and wasting the entire day away doing absolutely nothing its only dawned on me now that something could be wrong and i should hear others opinions on it of course im using a throw away because sharing this is embarrassing enough ive never considered myself depressed and honestly i never want to but every time hook up what lm dealing with sucide and help websites pop up i dont know how to go about this and i genuinely want to do better so if anyone knows some steps i can take to doing better id really appreciate it ive been like this my entire life because its just how grew up but dont want to waste away any longer,1
when i was i had the best year of my life only time i was hopeful and happy now im and ive spent the last years listing to the same songs from when i was i keep chasing that dragon but its just making me crippled with depression and suicidal thoughts how can i move on,1
im and im fucked ive had a really bad drinking problem for over a year i smoke a lot of weed and i have cut myself before im on holidays with my girlfriend and cant be happy i havent smoked in weeks and its killing me my drinking is just as bad up here except im trying to hide it i havent drank in days and im struggling my best friendcousin died years ago and i cant start to get over it i have massive retroactive jealousy and i hate it and i hate myself even more for it ive been bullied by family and friends and colleaguespeers since primary school ive never fit in or had friends anywhere every time i think i do they turn their backs and leave me my dad hates me and doesnt care if im alive or dead and my mum is depressed and i cant help her everything i do in my life is just mediocre and meaningless i cant be good at anything i have terrible luck wherever i go and whatever i do im so over feeling like this and being so fucking sad i cant get over my addictions and i cant feel any better with anything im fucking over it and i dont know what to do with myself anymore,1
you know the kind that is buried deep and you know its there because from time to time it makes you feel a great sadness for a moment or two thanks for reading,1
im struggling to understand whats the point of anything i feel like any goal i can hope to achieve in the future is pointless everyday i wake up i question why im still alive i must be alive for some reason but i really dont know what that is,1
the title explains it all i just want to want to help myself but im struggling and i feel like it would be best if i just wasnt here anymore,1
what are you meant to do when you hit and realise youve achieved nothing and never will that youre not special or creative or talented that the world will not change in the slightest because of you that fiction is depressing as these characters you love would scorn you for being useless and average and pointless i feel like as a kid i used to dream i could do something make something but here i am unable to make anything of worth doped up on prozac and working a basic admin job which i could do in my sleep but i dont know how to be anything more i dont have a mentor i dont have support or guidance i dont think i ever did im so unfulfilled i doubt im alone i suspect many people are like this which makes it worse really escapism hurts because all i can imagine is my beloved characters loathing me but i cant make anything in the real world as i dont know how and i dont have any real talent and absolutely no drive or passion sometimes the only thing i think i contributed is that being nearly menopausal at least i have never and will never breed so no others will feel like this i dont want the point of my life to be a negative i wanted childfreeness to give me the freedom to be worthwhile in my own right but i just am not i wanted to be a creator not a mere consumer all my friends are successful some famous some highly qualified some just with good jobs and fulfilment and i am without doubt the group loser im so tired im so jealous all the time i want to make something to give to people that they want and like but i have no audience nobody who cares or wants anything of me i cant even hold to any faith i cant believe i hate being atheistic i hate the lack of meaningful beauty to me im fully aware of the but nature is beautiful type arguments but without any animistic sentience i guess it doesnt matter to me but i cant do it i hate the doctrine of make your own meaning its illogical if ones self has no meaning then ones madeup meaning in turn has no meaning i used to love loving the gods but i cant feel them any more i miss my faith so so much and i cant make anything of myself in the real world the emptiness is so much,1
night time is always the worse the fear of tomorrow makes it hard to fall a sleep when sleep finally happened it is but a brief moment of peace,1
i am seriously regretting my decision to go to grad school i thought i was prepared for it but im wasnt i was an academically strong student in my undergraduate program and went straight to grad school after because i really enjoy academia i found my education to be so fulfilling but now the spark is completely lost ever since starting grad school my anxiety has never been worse i have always struggled but not like this i have panic attacks just from opening up my computer to do work the thought of opening my email makes my chest hurt anxiety is showing up in other areas ive had panic attacks because i was just convinced i was going to die within the next few days because i just felt it i have panic attacks when someone calls me thinking they are going to tell me theres been some horrible tragedy im convinced i see people with guns pointed toward me and i am going to be a victim of a mass shooting i know theres something really wrong going on right now and im so depressed i have no drive to do things the fear of consequences is building up my anxiety but the thought of doing the thing just seems like the most impossible feat ive barely submit any assignments i keep trying to get them done i tell myself that today is going to be the day i tackle even just one small thing but this horrible feeling inside my chest and stomach just paralyzes me from being able to get anything done i tell myself in minutes ill get up it turns into minutes to hours then the next thing i know ive exhausted myself from just thinking about what i have to do amp i decide that i will try again tomorrow each time i try again i fail i wish there was a way others could see how much effort i am putting in even brushing my teeth and taking a shower are demanding tasks eating isnt even enjoyable amp food doesnt taste appealing to me i nearly gag with every bite trying to feed myself i wish i didnt have to feel like this i want to enjoy school and pursue my passions i was so proud of how far ive come only to let is all crash and burn now,1
f every step i take forward gets fucked up one way or the other theres never a time any good thing lasts i think im a weirdo moron that most people dont like they think im so weird i get called a drug addict thats how off people think i am which is always a laugh because the most i do is drink wine at night i always thought it was my anxiety that made people think it but i think its because im just trash i have a year old daughter i have lived for since the day she was born and i just cant help but think shes better off without me doesnt matter how kind i am nobody cares about anyone anymore i just want it to end,1
everyone always saying things like im here for you dont worry and then when push comes to shove no one knows what to say or do to help you feel better i know they mean well but its almost annoying to hear treat yourself exercise do something to make yourself feel better all the time then no one understands why you cry so much arent up for socializing or are easily agitated im trying but its hard to do anything when it literally hurts to live sometimes i can still find glimmers of happiness here and there but the depression is overwhelming im not trying to blame those who dont understand i just dont think they truly understand how you feel unless theyve gone through something similar themselves,1
im a survivor of childhood sexual abuse so ive dealt with depression anxiety and ptsd my entire life i was bullied throughout all of school never had a girlfriend barely graduated and by my senior year i was ready to commit suicide someone told me it gets better and i need to hold on for the better days so i did here i am almost ten years later and my life has gotten monumentally worse im a kissless virgin at with no stable income and couldnt even finish my college degree because of finances my entire life is a waste and all the suffering was for nothing can any of you seriously say i should continue living,1
i am so mentally and physically ill that i cant keep jobs or go to school the realization that i am never going to feel better after the years of medication and on and off therapy because im so poor i cant afford healthcare its not even worth it anymore nothing makes me happy and i cant imagine myself actually managing to live a normal life because my brain is so messed up and wrong the thought of not existing anymore with all the every day stress makes me feel better and i dont want to exist anymore,1
this is a pretty ignorant question but is there a distinction between internally induced and externally induced depression for instance internally would be those cases where your neurochemicals just betray you youre moving through life just fine then suddenly youre bedridden with catatonic depression and only after being heavily medicated can you function externally would be a concatenation of failures or disappointments or miseries which blacken your view of humanity and existence itself to the point that you no longer see the good in people or the joy in experiences and eventually an reach a point where youre also dysfunctional and need to be medicated has anyone experienced the former,1
just my personal observations ive been in the mental health sphere a long time diagnosed with depression over years ago when i was a young teen social media these days seems to give a lot of attention to anxietyrelated illnesses especially postcovid absolutely justified and nothing wrong with it but i hear many more people say they have social anxietypanic attacksgad symptoms vs classic depression i see it in advertising and in my own circle as well maybe its just where i live my age im fortunate to not have both like some do i just cant relate and i feel like my friendsfamilyacquaintances with anxiety just cant fathom what its like to just have depression,1
i have written this message multiple times over the last few days finally decided to make a throwaway so i could have the confidence to post it i am a late ish male living alone with my dogs and cat i live in a collection of duplexes im stuck between a rock and a hard place the property was sold and the new owner is kicking everyone out under the pretense of massive renovations the new rent would be triple what im currently paying but the problem is i cant find anywhere i can afford thats not double my current rent the few places i have what were close dont allow the pets that give me motivation to keep living its gotten so bad that im not able to get up to go to work in the morning i dont know what to do ive been considering the cowards option but i guess thats why im writing this life sucks and i wish rent wasnt so high,1
just a personal win i decided to share dear journal i got sick again the same cyclical vomiting and upper stomach pain i had before yesterday and last night was the lworst of it im just now starting to feel slightly better my biggest regret is how quickly i wanted to end my life this wasnt a little pain by any means the last time this happened i had a psychotic break in the hospital and tried to cut myself open this time wasnt as severe or long but still the pain got so bad i wanted to end it all i even thought of how but by some stroke of fate i talked myself out of it citing mostly that i just wasnt ready i spent the rest of the night repeating that it will pass all storms pass this will too i know it sounds sillybut either by distracting myself or blind luck i started to feel better ive always believed you gotta do what you gotta do last night i had to survive and i did i dont know how or even why i managed to talk myself out of it but i am grateful i cant say ill always have that power it didnt even sound like words i would say i mean this will pass how clich but as the night passed and dawn broke i knew i made it just a reminder for anyone that needs it youre not fighting alone we can get thru this together,1
i wouldnt say it ever left me but the depression has gotten severe these past few days why me why cant i just feel happiness and live a somewhat normal life im a m who hasnt had a girlfriend since my early s i just dont see myself getting better the depression has consumed me and i feel terrible for my friends and family like maybe i am a root of the bad energy in the friend group i still live with my mom i have money saved but i have no clue what to do my appetite gone again all the weight and progress ive gained from the gym has been lost and i just have no energy or motivation at the moment i work part time and even at work some days i just feel so unfulfilled with my job i just feel like a freaking loser and im letting those around me down i am hoping it will either get better or i just die because im tired of feeling like this,1
i ask because ive been in therapy for depression anxiety secondary to aspergers for over years this shit dont work cbt schema therapy etc etc well it works for a very short time and then its back to square one with another depressive episode the last therapist even fired me as a client why because i didnt do my homework hilarious considering im a medical specialist and ive been doing the extra homework since i was in preschool whatever,1
i f have been struggling with severe depression and anxiety over the past few years the thing is im able to push through it all and put it on the back burner to interact in public settings im funny social and endearing with people who im not that intimately close with doing this i know its not how i genuinely feel but what people want me to be i just cant do it with people i love and are super close with it feels fake and like im deceiving the people i love that being said i met my bf and fell in love the whole nine yards and weve been comfortably dating for over two years ive grown to trust him and show him the parts of me that are slowly dying problem being i feel like the social persona i build is too fake for our relationship im struggling to maintain my half of the relationship because of this im so depressedanxious all the time and i cant bring myself to act and look happy ive effectively gone hermit and cant seem to navigate having a bf that i want around while im trying not to ya know i can fake it with everyone else i just dont want to have that fake mess with him i dont know what do bf is aware of my mental health and is understanding but i think one can only be so understanding for so long im also on medication for over a year and therapy,1
hello guys i was wondering if just cbt alone can help with moderate to severe depression in case drugs are of minimal help ive never actually engaged in a proper cbt plan since i was feeling like absolute shit all the time and i didnt believe that therapy would help and i wanted a drug to give some energy and motivation to go on with therapy more easily so since ive tried everything under the sun combinations etc and i dont have almost any positive effect it is actually minimal to be fair i decided to engage in therapy in order to treat my depression accompanied with extreme anxiety as well it is actually my last hope what do you think,1
im going to start dissociating soon i can tell when its about to happen i feel like i only exist for other peoples benefit im just a paycheck for my partner im just someone who takes the kids out on the weekend or helps put them to bed at night im just there to help and then when im done helping i need to shut the fuck up and go away and stop being needy and annoying nobody has time for me nobody gives a damn what i want but everyone needs me to exist is it worth living when you have nothing to live for and nothing to look forward to im just existing for the sake of existing id rather not exist anymore my feelings are not severely painful by any measure but they are constant and gnawing its this constant low level pain that is grind me down its hard to describe its boredom and loneliness and resentment mixed in with regret at all the choices ive made that lead me to this point in my life,1
i have pitifully low inteligence and iq im ostracized from people outside of internet as i never got friends since kindergarten and its mostly due to having lowiq ltthis message took me min to write its simple but to me it takes longer to thinkchoose wordsunderstand what i wrotethink what i want to write i struggle with major depressive disorder i dont discard others depression but by the look on social media it seems everyone else at my age has gotten a snippet of how it feels to be a complete failiure they still maintain to have proper hygiene as they should by time when elders taught them or self cleaning was their interests after stressfuldepressing night it seems that im fallen out of that area to be able to take care for myself as i mentioned i have low iq so job college is out of option cooking for myself is out of option im soon gonna have abscess tooth cuz of large sugar intake sugary drinks juices to cups of cofeee per day with table spoon sugar intake ive seen people who claim to have crippling level of depression while having well astounding life long achievements that didnt impact their regular life style such as washing themselfs brushing teeth wearing clean clothes cleaning rook every kow and then having friendships having not lesser healthier life styles than me while going through their self proclaimed worse period of life when i show how fucked up i live how fucked up im gonna be in few years nothing will yet better i cannot treat my depression cannot afford therapy while they discuss which therapist will suit better for their problems after many failed connections and attemptsconnecting with the right therapist all of those so happen to be highly inteligent people low iq people dont matter they will be thrown in special education classes later to be forgotten unlike gifted who get support from teachers from their parents from therapist they get to have friends who are relatable to their own level of inteligence while i was in special education my gifted brother was getting free cookies trips skipping classes more sleep i had to be in the same cafeteria as him my cousin was there so my familiy and relatives knew the whole ordeal of lonely me eating by myself while brother and cousins had friends to speak to even if i had companion to be with i wouldnt have anything to say cuz im dumb as fuck i have no mental map,1
i dont know what to make of it,1
i havent felt anything in so long i dont remember what it feels like to be happy i dont even think i care anymore i dont feel like myself i feel like a robot going through day by day i dont even have control of myself sometimes i just randomly regain my composure and im doing something i dont even remember doing i dont even feel worried i just feel numb i dont want help i just wanted to kind of vent,1
id like to stop trying i want to just accept it and try to live with it why cant i accept it,1
ive been stuck in another depressive episode for months now my last one was years ago and i really thought thats the end of it i dont understand how i got here again i cant live like this and im lost on what to do im just trying to exercise everyday but i feel awful,1

im barely lived i know yet sometimes i feel as if ive endured too much ive been laid off from two jobs and every day i just sit and procrastinate i constantly miss deadlines for my assignments and when i do my dad gets upset and yells making me feel like the stupidest person to ever exist or my siblings crack in insensitive jokes that completely destroy my self esteem my teachers constantly telling me that im behind my grade level or im not prepared enough for my senior year or that if i continue on this route i might have to retake a few classes even though this may sound like easy issues to some people it really ruins me every night i cry and think about how terrible of a daughter or sister and student i must be or how retarded i am to be failing almost every class now the only thing i think about literally ending my own life because i just dont care to exist anymore even if i was doing good in school id just be on the road to living a typical boring life where i work at a job that i hate and suffer until i reach my death bed a huge part of me just wants to end things now but for some reason i feel too scared idk but this was my little rant sorry if you came across it,1
first of all i dont believe in tarot reading it usually just reads current energy but future reading is usually just for guidance and would change afterall our future ultimately depends on us and our actions i am not clinically diagnosed as having depression because of lack of funds but i had a test last year from our office and i scored a level in terms of depression i guess thats the most one can get i think i got that score because because i scored a yes in terms of harming i never really thought of committing suicide but sometimes i think of what if somewhere some truck would just hit my car and id be in a car accident going back to tarot reading the reader never answered my question and it became a psychic read where in some spirit comes to talk to you she asked about my dad i said my dad had passed years ago she described how my dad is and telling me about my current situation how i am carrying everything and i need someone to depend on and help me this made me realize that as much as i have a close small group of friends ones whom i trust i really dont have anyone that i can truly depend on like who can i ask money for should i get to an accident etc none my mom and my brother is there but i really dont want them shouldering my problems i also realized that i am not living for anyone but why not live for myself its just a problematic life and i honestly wont mind if my life ends here it made me realize those people with children having all the will to live because they need and have to if you see me out it looks like im living such a good life i look good i dress well on weekend i go to brunches i watch musicals opera attend art galleries and eat good food i smile and i laugh but i also dont have money and i live paycheck to paycheck with lots of debts i need to have a thyroid operation which my healthcard cannot pay for fully so i will need to line up on a public government hospital last year i have a colleague who i used to be friends with we drifted apart because of work which is okay with me because you wont be friends for life with all of your friends some friendships has an expiration date thats just reality but it seems like groupings have happened at work and its really annoying sometimes in my head thats okay and ill just work the friend i have in the office also just got retrenched something happened at work again today and as much as i say i dont care about it as long as i know im in the right then i dont want to even think about it but i cried and honestly i just want to resign lay in bed look in the ceiling and have my thoughts run around i thought about dying again but i cant resign because i dont have a dollar to my name and bills i just need to tough it out until next year,1
i wanna die so badly the only reason i havent jumped off a cliff is beacause im the only one my mom has if i died she would be left all alone to mourn her dumb dead kid i wish i was never born why am i so useless ive realized that ive never really worked hard on anything i always try to take the easy route im homeschooled and i havent done any proper school work in a year im extreamly behind in school and idk if ill be able to graduate i want to sleep forever i feel like time is passing too fast and i just want everything to slow down i keep trying to catch up buti trip over my feet like a dumbass i got a job and i cant evn save money i spend it all once i get it and i cant stop what can i do to make sure i dont end up leaving my mom behind,1
i called off work today just hitting extra hard today i feel really sick and im in a really dark place i dont want to feel like this,1
ive been struggling with depression and anxiety for a good years now with the worst dip taking place a year back im slowly starting to get better but lately something weird has started happening the worst part of depression for me is the sadness that i cant seem to shake its not the normal kind of sadness rather the romanticheartbroken sadness ive not been in a relationship for a long time and im not well enough to be in a relationship at the time i still talk to girls like i used to but in a much more restricted way one person recently wrote to me and we started talking nothing intense or anything when that person doesnt answer or say something i could interpret as something negative through mental parkour my heart breaks i get the biggest pit in my stomach and i get completely engulfed in the sorrow this happened the very first day of us talking i am not in love with this person we dont really know eachother nothing has happened i dont even know if what were doing has any romantic side to it at all most of the time i can understand why i feel the way i do even if its mostly negative but this anxietyridden pit in my stomach wont go away and i cant reason with it so i guess the tldr i become unreasonably romantically attatched after just a few words over text which leads me to feel constantly heartbroken am i just lonely and i havnt realized it,1
my depression has gotten worse over the past few months ive been a major disappointment to my family and it seems like no matter how hard i try im not getting anywhere i dont like the thought of harming myself but im tired of this life i cant see myself living more years doing this anyway i know i need help i want to try getting on medication but i dont have insurance im poor af and dont currently have a job even though for months ive been trying to find one that doesnt cause me anxiety and pays decent enough one of the main things that makes me a disappointment to my family i want to know how do i go about finding freelow cost antidepressants and mental health facilities,1
i am just wasting my time i have great difficulty learning new things and remembering stuff from recent memory theres a point in time before which i remember everything nearly years ago now i just sot around pretending to work,1
i dont know why but i just feel like im gonna get judged in some way like if im gonna try and get help that ill just be told some sorry excuse of a conclusion that they came to by looking at a piece of paper i had to fill out in the waiting room the only way i can really describe it by is that i feel like im not good enough it just makes me feel even more helpless than i already feel i know im probably overthinking this which in itself is a whole other problem but i cant stop myself,1
i just hate what my life has become i remember being a happy kid and having goals for my life but everything went downhill since i was a teenager i made mistakes and i hate my life now i hate the decissions ive made why i have it so hard god,1
you try so hard in life so fucking hard and for what to face rejection in every facet of life only to be teased and ultimately let down again and again and again why fucking bother even an eternity in whatever version of hell is real sounds better at least you know what to expect there fuck life fuck people and fuck the instinctual desire for belonging because none of them have ever showed kindness to me without wanting tenfold back and not giving a minute to try to understand what someone goes through or how they feel time i return the favour by taking what some people are obligated to give a shit about the state and the family do not love unconditionally,1
or get in the boat or take a bicycle and just go no matter where im so stressed with my current life and its killing me like depression makes existing hard in itself but all this stress actually drives me to the edge of killing myself the thought of just going wherever not having to worry about anything is so soothing of course i probably wont ever do it im just daydreaming but thinking about this helps me relax a bit,1
on a work trip got paid to sit in my hotel room all day at night these thoughts overwhelm me a few years ago i met somebody who changed the trajectory of my life he was so beautiful he had such a beautiful soul he was so unlike me i was obsessed with him we even dated for a while i made his life a living hell i never treated anyone in my life as poorly and callously as i treated him im sure if he stayed with he wouldve died honestly he probably wouldve killed himself he ghosted me not a day goes by i dont think of him i wish i could go back and fix things and never say a word to him i miss his face i miss his voice i miss his hair so much im sure those are all long gone as he transitioned more and more of what i fell in love with would fade away i cant even imagine what he looks like now its sad the thing i miss most about him is the way he tasted what kind of human answer is that im a monster a devil i would kiss him for hours until his lips were bruised i would take the anger i have for this life out on him i could still hear him gasping for air i look at my hands and wonder why ive been depressed my entire life it was cruel of me to spread it to him he was an angel and i set him on fire to keep me warm im a walking black hole who tried to destroy him but he survived he has a pretty good life now it looks like well from the outside anyway but my soul wont heal and i cant forgive myself and he never will he never should i cant care about anything anymore my parents loved me so much my friends and family too but i cant feel it i dont deserve it anyways theres no reason why or how someone like me could be so evil i feel like a murderer this isnt depression these are just consequences you wouldnt say a murderer serving his sentence in prison in solitary confinement has depression hes inhuman he cant feel a thing,1
i learned this as a journalist covering suicide prevention groups as a depressive i can tell you that suicidal thoughts and thoughts of dying are a symptom of depression meaning our psyches are unwell normal function really seems to be about avoiding injury and deathself preservation i havent killed myself because i have to try for everyone else who struggles and because i have seen actual survivors who were glad they lived xo,1
i want to be successful in my life i want to teach live abroad and anytime im asking for advice or talk about it people destroy me entirely i dont get why they never want to see you shine,1
i just need to rant real quick everything sucks ive been stuck in dpdr for about years now its been bad but its gotten worse my home life hasnt been great for a while now my parents have been fighting a lot and recently told me they were going to divorce soon my sister constantly degrades everyone in the house and will sit around all day and refuse to go to school my mom is having work trouble and my dad has kinda been the punching bag of it all fighting and yelling has become a regular occurrence i cant stand it ive been trying to keep myself together and come off as calm so maybe some stress could be taken off of everyone but im actually falling apart inside my theory is if they see that im calm they will have one less thing to worry about im always anticipating the next fight between any of the three and it sucks i actually feel a sense of relief at school because atleast im away from all this but schools not any better ive gotten to the point where i dont recognize myself in the mirror i dont see me i see a shell i want to get out and run away from everything im only so thats not an option though nothing feels real and i just dont want to be here anymore i just feel stuck and i have no one to talk to every time i would try to talk to my mom about my dpdr she would say ive been looking at the internet too much i dont want to talk to her about it because im scared shell say that again or explode from all the stress she also dumps all her work problems on me and that just adds to the stress im just scared i dont want them to divorce i just want things to go back to the way they were i dont know how much longer i can hold it in i was diagnosed with depression a couple years ago and have meds but im so tired and drained that i cant remember to take them i just dont know what to do anymore,1
weed snacks falling asleep on the couch not brushing my teeth or doing simple chores fun times being depressed and making my own life worse anyone else,1
thats kind of it ive made a lot of discoveries about myself in the last few years and ive also had a lot of unfortunate things pop up and while i dont actively want to die i can say with certainty that life almost never feels worth it anymore i wish i could go back to when i was depressed but still had structure to fall back on to and things to be excited about to when i was just a kid and didnt knowthink so much now i just cant seem to get and keep a hold on anything i dont want anything for myself not anything thats within reach at least i feel so alone life is so tedious and adulthood depression is a different beast,1
i started developing fears first i got really claustrophobic to the point where my dad exchanged an rv we bought because i couldnt sleep in the bunk beds due to panic attacks there were also other reasons for the exchange main ones being the need for more space and storage and now ive developed a fear of the dark i got used to just leaving the light on in the hallway if i got too scared but today i went to bed without the light and looked out of my door im used to sleeping with it open and saw these stick figures and im telling you it scared the shit out of me i literally felt my heart drop thankfully it stoped after a few seconds of terror turning on my phones flashlight pretty much saved me now that im thinking about it it might be due to the fact that i havent slept in hours but ultimately i feel like living is hard enough without me being constantly in fear of things that i know arent real but my stupid brain still wont let go of also my doctors know im not taking my meds anymore it was my doctors plan to get me off them slowly i just kinda skipped the whole getting off your meds slowly part and went cold turkey i guess i just needed to vent,1
in what world is this worth it slowly sinking in to poverty and being told just try harder i am legitimately angry with myself for not being brave enough to kill myself i hate it here life is a joke i hope every night to die in my sleep and wake up disappointed im so fucking tired this is all for nothing,1
im years old and i feel so lost confused and like a major failure a little backstory i graduated highschool at age took an month break before starting with university and when i started i had to move to new country and manage everything by myself at i started slacking ever since i had arrived tbh i barely did my work cause i had no clue where to start or what to do but whenever i had an understanding of the work and what to do id get really proud of my outcome but moving on from that i was barely attending my lectures and doing anything by the end of the year so i had failed my first year i wasnt very proud of myself however i did it to myself so i had to accept and move on from it and figure out how to do better im now repeating my first year and classes have in the beginning of this month and i feel like its almost the same thing as last year ill be turning in a few months and i feel like a shit human and i actually am trying but i just dont know what to do with myself if youve ever felt like this and had gotten thru it please give me advices,1
i dont feel love and affection from others anymore before i could talk to girls i was interested in and enjoy it now i feel nothing but boredom and apathy when it comes to romance i dont get it makes me think ill be alone eva,1
if u reach out to someone trying to help do not compare the severity of yours and their mental issues offer them genuine support,1
i really wish there was a way to make quick money without working or having a business because with those you still have to wait for payment even in emergency situations with loan companies they either deny you or take you through a million applications just to steal your info im tired of living this hard life,1
this time i made myself sad because my roommates dog wanted to play i started doing a tug of war with him with a rope and suddenly lost all heart because i knew i wasnt going to get my fat ass out of the chair to play with him hed only get an arms length of attention so i dropped the rope and he just looked at me and then left why is it all im wiling to do is sit around and feel sorry for myself the only thing i can feel is sorry for myself,1
so tired of being stuck in depression limbo bored to tears and no will to do anything,1
how do you handle when youre trying so hard not to let your teenagers depression get to you when youre also depressed how do you not fall apart and give up,1
i honestly am about to kill myself i just dont care anymore and dont want to breathe i just want to feel pain theres nothing here for me anymore i dont care what anyone says,1
ive been through a lot in my years of life things never really made sense to me in th grade i told my mother i didnt want to be alive anymore she found a therapist and i started medication for add it helped and i continued taking it until i graduated in my freshman year my friend had committed suicide it never really hit me until his funeral where i promised to myself to never cause that much pain to the people that love me i swore that day i would never commit suicide while i still have friends and family that love me just so i could never cause them that much pain but ive realized something changed in me or rather hasnt changed in me since that day im not living for me i havent been living for me in such a long time ive only ever lived for the people i care about recently my year long relationship came to an end i tell myself its for the best that i couldnt treat her right anymore that we grew apart but she understood sadness and depression she lived with it for all of her life and i failed her by letting my resentment of our relationship get the better of me im proud she was able to leave me i couldnt ever leave her i wasnt strong enough so now im left with the realization i have been living my life months at a time never looking further because i feel that i will be dead by next year feeling like it doesnt matter what i do ive set myself goals and im getting therapy for the first time in over a decade but i cant shake the feeling of failure the feeling that no matter what i do it wont matter because ive masked this feeling since i was young because i believed the lie i was telling everyone and now that lie is witness to the world so my question is is anyone truly happy is anyone actually happy because for me happiness was chasing a feeling of being wanted being appreciated respected i could only catch small instances of it so now i ask how do i become happy again tldr is anyone really happy can i feel happiness again how do i be happy,1
i feel like i am living in a loop i have no friends all i do in life is do things i am supposed to do and cry myself to sleep i thought going to the gymwould make me happier but it got fuckin worse the only difference is i became physically healthy and mentally ill,1
fuck human nature why does my pathetic brain care so much about what people think of me ive been lonely most of my life and it can be comfortable at times but i can never be whole for as long as i have to deal with this,1
used to be able to find the good in the day now i just wait to go to bed in a house by myself,1
it sucks being mentally retarded theres nothing your good atyour life has no value and youre incapable of learningyour brain is useless and doesnt operate how its supposed to,1
because i am trying to not think about all the negative things that i am going through and as soon as someone asks me this question it reminds me that things are not okay and i get sad not only that but times people ask this question because it became a habit and not because they actually care how you are it has become just an addition or an alternative to hello i only ask people how they are if they seem to not be in a good mood and i would actually care to find out whats wrong someone might say what if they may not seem sad but still have something wrong with them then that most likely means that they are hiding it and that they would rather not talk about it like many of us i always say that i am fine just because i dont want to explain to them my issues because they would not understand at all and i know this because i have tried this many times i believe many people here also feel the same or at least something similar to this,1
you go out into the world because you have to you spend the whole day trying to muster the energy to be social and push past your social anxiety you know you still dont have the sufficient social skills or enthusiasm about life necessary to be attractive to women but you persist with this life anyways trying to learn what you can from the men you see around you who seem happy able to confidently express themselves who bring good vibes who have something to say and are interesting and then inevtiably you look at where you are in life what you know what you are like you are trying to change but its not working really you try to have a real interest and love for things in this world but it is not coming naturally due to whatever mental or developmental reason you constantly forget about the things you try to learn about moat of your brainpower is being used trying your hardest to be socially acceptable and not seen as an awkward teenager in an adults body constantly thinking about self presentation and body language always knowing that it is your outward presentation that largely impacts your opportunities in life and at the end of the work day you come home you are exaughsted but your job doesnt pay well so you are supposed to use the time after work to study and work towards a better future but you feel beaten down and tired when you get home you can barely muster the energy to work out if you do it takes forever because you are tired and you cant focus and if you are me a day spent among the socially competent and likable is enough to send you into a negative thought spiral googling about how to improve social skills feeling tired when you read about what you have to do you are already tired it is a compounding tiredness you know it isnt your sleep or your diet both of those are in check its just life a life that you are having trouble with feeling enthusiastic about in the first place every day the nagging thought that you will always be alone is ever present in the back of your mind you cant stop thinking about those women who you did not have a choice but be attracted to romantically not in a very heavy way they were just someone you actually wanted to shoot your shot with and you know you failed with these women and during the time you knew them you sat and watched as the aforementioned likable charismatic men of the world easily swooned them entertained them freely loved them and their love was accepted and you look at that and see that you are not like them you will never be like those men you can try every day to painstakingly get there you can try as hard as you can to relax and be a fun person to be around but you never quite reach that state of being you often wonder if you are not mentallycognitively capable of being like those men and you realize that all of this is making you tired still in addition to feeling essentially doomed to be alone in this world you are confronted with its relentless challenges and you wonder what is the point of it all is this life worth living is there a reason to smile when you are the kind of person that you are in this world and you cant seem to really change despite your absolute best effort which you painstakingly put in every day only to return to the same sad tired state at the end of the day its difficult to get excited for life when you feel socially incapable and generally unlovable when you feel unable to bring value to other people as a friend as a companion another day wasted a day of work is to be followed by a day of work towards a better life for which there doesnt seem to be any energy my mind is tortured with the thought that i am not fundamentally a good enough person to be with this thought never goes away i will always be alone,1
i was talking to an acquaintance about my new job i talked about how i enjoyed it and i seemed to be good at it i started to feel selfconscious because i thought i was bragging but at the end she told me not to be so hard on myself and that i should have more confidence has anyone else had an experience where they thought they were too confident but it turns out they werent confident enough,1
i feel as if i am nothing more than a general nuisance to people i say this because i had a falling out with someone that i once considered to be my best friend while we were both away at college last fall ive known this young lady since high school and i had a lot of trouble trying to make connections and new friends and thus she was the only person i really had up there because i was so lonely she felt that i wasnt giving her any space and that i was too intrusive and as a result it feels like she wants nothing to do with me anymore sometimes i question if she really wanted me around i remember during her birthday last year she had a bit of a celebration and i only found out because her then boyfriend posted it on instagram i felt left out she said that she didnt want a large group and thus only invited people her parents didnt know and planned on celebrating separately with people they already knew when we did just that she texted me two minutes before i was supposed to have her up that she was at a pizza party and would be running late she did not show for another two hours this past month ive tried to reach out to her in an attempt to make amends she barely responds to me i asked if we could be able to talk in person over face time or over the phone but i get no response because she seldom responds i feel i have to start the conversation all over again its stressful and it hurts my feelings meanwhile before i went up to college i worked as a lunch monitor at one of my local elementary schools this was immediately after i finished high school while i loved working with the children i had some problems there some of the kids were defiant and very stubborn in their defiance in the months before i went off to college i tried to start a bowling club but most of the kids would not even listen me and would just rough house and fool around but the worst part was the treatment i was received from two separate staff members during the school year when i started working at the school lunch was held in the classrooms and not the cafeteria in the kindergarten classroom i worked in there was a young boy who had trouble remaining seated and the teacher got angry with me for two whole months she would scream at me calling me irresponsible complaining about how i cant be trusted and how i must be firm when i decided to be firm which was what she wanted she had another adult in the room at times while i was there if she felt i was doing something wrong why cant she treat me like a normal human being apparently she would go around and tell other people that she has to yell at me i filed a complaint against her to human resources and apparently they felt she did nothing wrong,1
hello everyone im slowly losing touch with reality i dont know if its important but ive been diagnosed with depression and social anxiety since when i was hospitalized for six months due to burnout since then i dont know if im truly happy or just pretending unconsciously i started dating my boyfriend in but we broke up in late when he cheated on me with my best friends exgirlfriend it was the first time i lost control over my actions and thoughts i was sometimes treated as the perpetrator even though i was just existing in that state i stopped eating and felt no energy to nourish my body and even when i tried i couldnt i was on the brink of doing something stupid fully aware of how foolish it was thankfully i ended the relationship i distracted myself with friends some of whom were also going through breakups i learned that alcohol could help me cope with my social anxiety at least for a few hours where i could enjoy the happy feelings without overthinking i did this for about months almost every weekend with friends and it helped me try new things and gain new experiences however i always had a nagging feeling that grew into a thought as i try to be the motivator in the group and the funny person i feel like my problems are underestimated externally and im becoming lonelier each week i realize that i couldnt confide in anyone with all my thoughts i always talked about my problems objectively but never let myself break down because i felt it would be too exaggerated and too intense now that i miss those weekends i feel more isolated every week i also have other things that bother me at home making it hard to feel comfortable my parents also only understand depression as a common cold that should be cured after hospitalization i dont know what to do anymore i feel like a stone,1
ive been seeing this person for about months and until recently everything seemed to be going really well between us we texted most days and hung out around times a week on average which felt like a lot considering their time off and energy levels about a month and a half ago they told me they were having a depressive episode ive never had a partner with chronic depression and was pretty ignorant to what it can do so i was taken by surprise when they started ghosting me about a week ago it was very abrupt and everything seemed to be going really well until then since then ive tried my best to learn up and it and it seems like this kind of thing is pretty common among people with chronic depression especially those whove had a long history of partners who do not react well to their depression normally i would not tolerate someone ghosting me but reflecting back on everything theyve told me about their depression and how theyre dealing with it made me realize how much effort they put into trying to address their depression and maintain a relationship in spite of it theyve confided in me a lot of trauma theyve had to deal with in their life and the type of thoughts they struggle with last time we hung out in person i could tell theyd been really struggling with some of those traumatic events recently even during this episode they had some pretty traumatic events happen back to back but still made an effort to hangout and talk to me with everything extra they were now having to deal with i would like to make an effort to keep contact with them for a reasonable amount of time and hopefully get back to how we were before the depression got this bad the ghosting still hurts and its totally possible that they are just being a bad person and not telling me they dont want to see me anymore but after researching it and talking about it in therapy and with some of my friends who deal with depression i think its more likely theyre pulling away due to the depression over the past week i sent two messages trying to be supportive and let them know that i respect their space and want to interact with them in any small way they want however ive learned that these longer texts more than a couple sentences can be harder for a person going through a depressive episode to respond to and might make them feel worse for not responding definitely dont thing the messages were bad or anything and the people i shared them with agreed but it looks like going forward i should keep messages shorter and easier to respond to with an emoji or maybe even a small response given all this id just like some advice from those also struggling with chronic depression about how youd like a partner who youve been seeing for as long as ive been seeing mine to communicate with you during situations like this my current plan is to keep going with my life but text them again a week from now and maybe continue doing that for months or until they tell me to stop i dont want them to feel overloaded with my messages and push them away but i do want to keep the idea in their head that im still here and want to be with them thank you all in advance,1
i cant quite describe the exact feeling but its like an infinity engine i feel sad my stomach starts roiling i continue to feel awful i dont know whats worse the physical symptoms or the mental ones,1
i had everything some friends i still went to school a good job a family that loved me and now what do i got nothing i tried i really did but in the end i menaged to lose everything,1
im just tired of being alive im dealing with so much shit at a young age i dont know how i can live like this it all started when me and my ex broke up i figured out i had chlamydia which turned into reactive arthritis because it was left untreated for so long before that though i was diagnosed with gerd which messes with me sometimes and then not too long after the breakup i hit a dab and got nerve damage in both my feet and handsat one point i couldnt feel my legs or hands for a week and i still dont know what i havei have mouth ulcers that wont go awayim too depressed to even shower or just take care of myself hygiene wisei believe the chlamydia was left untreated so long it caused permanent fertility issues so idk if ill be able to have kids in the future or if i even want any because i cant trust another female and time and time again my doctors kept telling me i didnt have autoimmune issues yet i get nerve damage from hitting a dab like wtfi had dreads but they started to thin and fall out so now my self esteem is at rock bottom especially after my ex left and i still think about her till this day and dont think ill ever get over her and all the long term illnessesdiseases im dealing with i dont think ill ever get over those and im only does anybody have any possible advice they can give me because im seriously just thinking about unaliving myself like no one understands the constant turmoil i go through on a daily basis i need some help,1
ive recently moved to another country and ive been really upset about it i have to go to a new school and that new school has very little natural sunlight its almost gray i dont know how to explain it compared to my older school it was really bright and pretty this new school just makes me have so much negative thoughts for whatever reason its just so visually unpleasant dull and gray it just makes me so weirdly sad to be there does anyone know if this is normal,1
the slightest inconvenience will send me into a negative spiral i am so incredibly weak i dont know what to do,1
hi im f ive been downl for a long time ive never actually been diagnosed with depression but professionals have said i show severe signs of it although the last time was a while ago i see a therapist every few weeks but i can never get across things properly when i see her and she tends to talk more about herself i have these episodes where i am so so upset and only the one family member i live with has seen this its pent up frustration and sadness with my life i know this sounds absurd but ill pull my own hair hit myself i have massive bruises all over my legs currently because i was hitting myself i feel crazy after and think wtf is wrong with me but in that moment i absolutely cant describe the feelings its just absolutely frustration with my life im so lonely i regret with all my heart not going to university last september like everyone else did working part time since then was ok but i have no friends anymore and the ones from school were horrible to me now i have no one loneliness is a bitch and i cant describe how stuck and trapped i feel i used to self harm with razors but i stopped idk how but i did and i feel tempted to relapse but now i resort to hitting myself and scratching myself i wish i could get help but idk what anyone is supposed to do im trying to get on antidepressants that my therapist suggested but idk if itll help am i the only one who does this or am i rlly just messed up,1
the fact that there are people who are motivated and passionate about stuff feels so alien to me any one else think this way,1
i often feel if i could accept my depression that i wouldnt struggle as much as i do i wonder if the fight and the hope however dim that light might be are the reasons why i cant seem to shake the bone crushing sadness its so physically uncomfortable now i havent handled becoming a full time caregiver to my very sick wife well i havent grieved having to walk away from the work i love to do so i havent managed to find any peace with the idea that i might never know physical or sexual intimacy ever again my depression anxiety agoraphobia all predate these turns of events but the way theyve been amplified and my inability to effectively cope has caused me a shit ton of distress i find that i tend to isolate even more than usual because i genuinely cant imagine anyone wants to spend time or energy on someone with such a low self esteem i have tried to take steps towards combatting the loneliness but every time i get close to breaking the cycle ive created for myself i run away and hide i do wonder if this is because i know i cant handle another heartbreak or rejection and so ive subconsciously determined the risks are too high that connection with anyone else could push me over what it already a precarious cliff i just want safe connection someone who knows what and who i am going in and accepts the subsequent ups and downs while remaining as committed to my well being as i would be to theirs i come here and post sometimes but nothing much comes of it i guess i hope that one day the right person will see my post at the right time and the universe will connect two lost souls so we can help each other navigate out of the hell that is depression is that you please feel free to send me a message if you have the same fears that i do i promise you that i will work to ensure we have a safe space to talk to figure out to growi dunnois this all wishful thinking i guess i want something more tangible to cling to,1
i feel like my life is falling apart my relationship just ended and my belongings are stranded in that persons house i just left a job that i loved as i had no future there i have literally no money my meds are completely not working and the new stuff i tried made me sick and wanting to hurt myself i feel like im drowning and i cant pull myself up,1
the story of these years of my existence is a long one ive been loved have loved back and have experienced happiness and joy countless times i am grateful for that but now i must go for my suffering has become too much to bear,1
everything is as fine as its going to get i just want to go home and blow my motherfucking brains out,1
ive been trying to get back to work again because it seems my severe depression and anxiety wont go away and there is only so much medication and therapy can help me of course i havent tried every kind of therapy but what had been offered to me at low cost but ive tried many medications anyhow i feel very frustrated because after trying couple of online part time jobs like writing marketing stuff on websites and finding myself not motivated enough to work sufficient hours to make ends meet im trying to start from zero again and do some career tests to find what motivates me but those tests dont offer some magical information but just rely on what youre passionate about like they give you questions and ask you how much you like doing different activities like installing cabinets diagnosing disease in people giving financial advice to someone wanting to get a loan helping a disabled person get dressed playing a musical instrument in front of an audience taking care of sick animals etc etc etc i hate them all none of these activities excite me because having a job is always about what others expect of you but mental illness sucks so much of your energy that there is so little left for the job like if im a cashier my high anxiety and depression and the various thoughts and emotions and physical symptoms i experience will take so much of my energy to control and nothing left to put on a smile and make a customer feel welcome and at the same time do my job of scanning items very quickly and correctly thats why ive been trying to find jobs that are just online and things i can do on my own time so that whenever the damned mental health issues give me a break then i can do the job the problem is there are too many people doing these jobs and they pay so little that ive had to start looking at other options damn it i dont know what i want to hear from you to be honest i mean i already am so filled with selfhatred and hatred for the world i am working myself into anger just writing about it,1
i have been dealing with some difficult things lately and have recently tried to get my meds increased but long story short doctors suck and they wouldnt talk to me about my meds anywho i also just lost my best friend of years tonight over some religious beliefs that i hold i dont really understand why especially since they werent things i even brought up often unless asked never delved into unless asked whatever because regardless i am having suicidal ideation although i am not actually considering suicide and am feeling a strong urge to self harm again for the first time in years how likely is it that getting myself committed would help the situation for context i have called hotlines in the past and their methods make me feel worse do mental hospitals take a similar approach what have your experiences been i am a hospice cna and would prefer not to have to take time off work if i can help it as well as i have patients that need me,1
i cant stand being sober my thoughts and feelings consume me with every waking moment and they infiltrate my dreams i finally got out of the abusive household that was killing me i have a fantastic remote job that pays well i have a full scholarship to college im not paying a dime back in student loans i have a girlfriend who loves me and cares about me i have physical freedom calmness peace and serenity my girlfriend recently called me a hourjob my career sucks the soul out of my body i am selfsupporting which means i have to work fulltime and maintain excellent grades in my honors university classes i dont have a moment to breathe i wake up in a frenzy during the night and i just relapsed after years of sobriety because i couldnt take it anymore i have no other friends nobody to call when i need help im a social outcast because i spend so much time working and doing homework that i have no time or energy to form new social connections im suicidal because i think im broken beyond repair theres no sense in crying over spilled milk but i relive trauma from my past over and over again my parents use me as their trophy child therapist and emotional punching bag my girlfriend uses me for validation and money im weird and unlikeable the only way out for me is death no matter how much i achieve or where i relocate i take my broken brain and personality with me,1
i have people i can reach out to right now but im not going to im so terrified of being a burden yadda yadda yadda thats what support is but i refuse to be that person that drags people down ive seen how ugly it can get how it destroys the people that want to help you to theyre better off without me,1
i am currently taking a lot of psych meds fro treatmentresistant depression i feel so sleepy all day i literally fall asleep again and again even though i sleep the whole night stimulants like coffee make me even more sleepy i dont know what to do my exam is almost here i dont want to fall asleep in the middle of it i am tired of this my meds are bupropion mg venalafixine mg lamotrigine mg paroxitine mg,1
being alive feels like a punishment and being ugly just makes it worse i feel like ive committed a grave sin just for looking the way i do i feel like such a fuck up right now my social anxiety just keeps getting worst and its even worse when i go out in public and i keep thinking about all the mistakes that ive made and how im seen as less than everybody i hate my fucking self rn i hate my fucking face and my life and just every fucking thing about me i hate that im mentally unstable and im so tired i really dont want to die but i dont want to really be here i wish i could restart my life and make better choices maybe things would be better for me rn i hate that i expect myself to be perfect and then get all frustrated when i cant meet those expectations and just beat myself up,1
i dont want to feel like this forever,1
im and recently ive been very anxious and depressed maybe because i overthink all the things but recently my gf and i broke up she told me that i have to deal with my shit to be better person days later she texts me saying she was wrong and i forgive her she told me that the real reason that she broke up with me was because i made cry her bff but it turns out that i never did that it was and old coworker that talked shit about me i thought that with that clear everything would be good but the last days shes been so cold ignoring my messages and all those days she went back where we used to work with tye coworker that talks shit about me and i dont know maybe hes telling more shit about me maybe thats the reason shes been so cold maybe i dont deserve her i just dont know my anxiety is killing me and i just dont know what to do,1
this is probably ridiculous but im curious any gothsemosmetal heads find a treatment for depression that works for you and still stay emo or did your astheticsmusic choices change when your depression symptoms were relieved im a metal head grew up emopunk its my biggest personality trait and music is my main hobbypassion its the biggest thing holding me back from getting treatment which i know sounds ridiculous but i dont want to lose this part of myself,1
i was told i was too empathic but also selfish and a piece of shit i was told im too giving but also selfcentered i just cant stop caring i know that for a fact but i cant stop being a dick and messing up its something i have no control over im drowning into these voices and things people tell me i am or im not im not a good person but im also not bad but i need somebody to save me therapy wont save me my non existent friends wont save me so now what i cant stop caring whether it is what you say or other people say i just cant stop caring taking other peoples shit with me like its my personal baggage i just cant stop caring for or about others,1
the door snapped off the hinges after like seconds i was totally ready to accept defeat and yet here i am i should have tightened them first,1
im so tired i hate working and i hate how little im paid i cant even afford rent let alone my own home or even food everyone wants me to do this or that and i cant im so tired of not being able to afford even the simplest of things why is it so hard to just get a good paying job let alone survive,1
basically i dont feel very smart or that my brain functions as well as it should and so i eventually was able to get a neuropych evaluation the results were that my scores were generally low overall but they said depressionanxiety is what could be causing this that was kind of a bummer to hear since i feel my life is extremely laid back and i dont feel depressed but somehow im supposed to be smarter with the help of therapy does this make sense to anyone to add to that im not currently working but one recommendation is to find purpose through work but when i was working making good money and in an environment i seemed to really enjoy i still felt just about the same smartswise,1
i am barely holding on the sadness loneliness depression anxiety and grief is just too much to handle i cant take it,1
most of the time i dont feel any kind of suffering i just feel like nothing is ever going to make me happy and like the future holds nothing for me im so used to it at this point i feel almost nothing from the thoughts im so irritable and sensitive now i cant even talk to my friends like i used to i always just thought this was normal or just part of me but i was diagnosed with severe depression recently and its just so depressing to think about the future like no amount of success or money or anything would bring me happiness lmao i really am just hoping it gets better for me i wanna be happy,1
yup thats right depression is my only friend its so great to feel so unwanted insecure hopeless lonely guilty anxious fatigued and emotionally unstable depression is my bestest friend in the whole wide fucking world i love it so much its so great its the best thing that has ever happened in my useless pathetic existence yeah its so great i hate my fucking life i just want to die,1
im so fucking sick of all of this shit tbh and i dont wanna hear it gets better because it doesnt ever since ive moved to a new city its been back to back dog shit i got bullied lost all of my friends in my old city lost more friends that i made and ive never been able to make a decent friendship i used to think it was funny how i would always meet with the wrong people i would joke with my cousins about it well im sick of it now im sick of being the only one in the family with no friends even my deadbeat brothers have friends i have only my cousins and trust me i value them but do u know how much it hurts to be on the phone with them but theyre also on the phone with their friends too im sick im also sick of liking girls i am a girl but i dont like boys im tired of hearing my mom want grankids or for me to have a husband even though ive shown no interest for guys or children at all in my fucking life i was also depressed this entire month except my birthday and after that and i came home because i went to miami i got severly depressed again i even tried to cut myself just to feel something but got scared i ended up just deleting all my social media and going on dnd i just wanna die i never asked to feel all these emotions i also hate achool i cant hqve my phone cant wear the clothes i like and i do unnecessary work that wont matter in the long run im sick of everything i wish i could just stay home and rot in my sleep but everytime i just keep waking up and having to repeat the same shitty day again wake upschoolwalk dogssleeprepeat this will never end,1
i literally just dont care about anything nothing gets me excited or happy for example i used to be obsessed with the beach only got to go a few times last time i went i tried so hard to get myself excited but i just didnt care nothing felt different i was just in a different place time before that i physically couldnt sleep and i was so excited and when we got there its like i was so happy it was this magical amazing place it doesnt matter what it is fairs reading a new game that comes out days off nothing is happy or fun or interesting everything just feels the same and its so empty i havent felt genuine happiness in over years and even that was only temporary when i was with my then boyfriend and im so scared i might never again,1
i feel like i dont matter theres a lot of sadness here and there too idk i dont see myself hanging in there for any longer i guess im just tired of people hurting me mentally and projecting their ageism onto me because im a f i dont even think thats old everyone is just weird nowadays but i try not to let it get to me,1
im going to keep this short because im having a mental breakdown right now so it takes tons of energy to type so basically im a guy and im which is one of two things that make me the most suicidal i cant accept that im always going to look ridiculous no matter where i go im going to have to move to east timor or something country with the shortest people when all my life ive wanted to move to italy i just dont know what to do i would give anything to be even thats why it pisses me off so much when i see guys who are complaining about how theyre not or taller i shouldve killed myself years ago cause leg lengthening surgery is quite dangerous and that still wouldnt make me tall enough to be taken seriously,1
so i enjoy journaling for a few different reasons and as i continue to do it and get better at it the more natural it feels allowing you to really make use of it and get something out of it before this recent journaling expedition i had never journaled maybe stupid little doodles and quotes from songs or something in notebooks but not really journaling or for any real purpose i was somewhat curious and interested in the idea as it had always been suggested to me by programs institutions therapists etc however i couldnt get past my biggest hurdle which was how to begin journaling without feeling really really silly or like some teeny girl in highschool writing about people she doesnt like or her crushes or whatever it just felt awkward and silly i debated on doing it for a while and i think one day i said to myself to just do it see how it goes and do it day after day or just twice a day even if all i write is a sentence or a gratitude or a to do list the idea was just to start doing it and developing the healthy habit so my first entries were very crude im looking at one now and it basically says thc nj is cool apply to jobs start new rpg gonna cook steak start reading do androids dream of electric sheep finished it that week this is my st time journaling may add more later lol talked to lily billy need to more often then l stated a short gratitude for the day this first journal entry i was grateful for reddit cause i believe i made a post prior to writing that entry asking for tips on how to journal i posted on a few mental health groups a few addiction or drug based subs and a few writing subs and got all sorts of helpful tips but my first few entries remained pretty crude for a week or so my first entry was on so ive been doing it almost daily some days multiple times in one day and some weeks ill go or days without journaling like just recently but i dont like doing that cause now i notice a sort of disconnect from myself when i dont journal habitually its constant confirmation of all your thoughts and beliefs and you see how your idea develop and progress thinking something and thinking something then writing it down on paper physically putting the idea into the universe helps establish it i skip a week or so into my journaling and now im talking to it more like how traditionally people think journaling goes like raw free thought sort of thats definitely a very important part of journaling though you can and will develop your own entire journaling style based on your needs or what you want out of it i thought i would hate the free thought aimless formula but its what i use the most now because the habit of writing allowed me to get comfortable with it and explore its benefits i just moderate it by usually including short term or long term goals gratitudesor something but not always if you dont feel it you shouldnt force yourself you dont wanna say a bullshit gratitude just to write something for gratitude if you dont feel it dont write it so yeah fast forward in my journal and im talking about the day we went to the park after group and we smoked a bit and played football and frisbee and saying how nice it is before that some goals and gratitudes short term goals i begin to write about accomplishments ive made and things i see different in myself i talk about some of my inner growth but ill mention a specific think like in how the past year and a half ive been fucked up like of those days or how i feel my brain is finally begin to repair itself cause i can feel some sort of natural euphoria at times dopamine release is finally becoming more regulated ill write how i finished a book in a week and thats also an accomplishment a big accomplishment i had to write down was hygiene when i was in heavy active addiction or even sober just severely crippled with depression id go a month without brushing my teeth weeks without showering so i wrote down that accomplishment it effects self esteem ego and confidence when you go back and read goals you had and accomplishments youve made on a daily basis you get to physically see growth or change in yourself instead of just feeling youre doing better you have written proof youre logging your mental state everyday and you go back after a month when you forget what you wrote and youre like oh shit wow i cant believe i actually accomplished that or shit i cant believe i even wanted to accomplish that being able to go back and read what you wrote after you forgotten it is a visceral feeling theres no real way to journal and im still figuring out my best way but it changes some days its free thought one day its lists and goals and gratitudes sometimes a healthy mix sometimes its something funny that happened that day good to go back and read on funny moments youd otherwise completely forget about it can immortalize them so to speak sometimes its topics i wanna go down rabbit holes on youtube and ill mention it in the journal so that if i forget ill come back to that page on my own at some point and remember i could imagine how amazing it would be to have years worth of your own personal journals now must be pretty fucking cool get to see huge change in yourself and never forget where you started reddit gave me an overwhelming amount of good information and i took what i thought would work for me still plan to read more on journaling tips soon as i wanna evolve it further and do more for with it but ive been doing it for a like a little over a month so ill keep learning and adding journaling objectives as i continue doing it all in all journaling serves to strengthen your relationship with yourself i know my explanation wasnt the best so i recommend also searching reddit or google on your own for more journaling tips that work for your needs the end,1
i dropped out of high school let me explain when i was a freshman covid happened and i did online school up until i was a sophomore then schools switched back in person but ive always struggled with it id get bullied my friends would ignore me and id just be alone all the time the teachers hardly helped me they always favor the popular kids its not their fault i tried a program for my junior year they said theyd help me get the credits i needed it was all online at first it was okay but after a month they dropped the bomb i got a bunch of homework that was due within a week then they wanted to do a test that was a huge factor in my grade and they wanted me to turn on my camera and answer every and any questions they had and based on that they would give me my grade it gave me bad anxiety i wasnt learning anything the whole thing was just do this do that so i gave up since then ive been thinking of getting my ged my oldest sister got her ged my friends brother got his ged so maybe i can get mine but im scared to go back into any sort of school setting my anxiety was so bad in high school i couldnt walk alone in the hallways i felt like everyone was judging me or laughing at me i could never make it to class even if i did id end up leaving theres a online option for getting my ged but im scared itll just be like that program i did and i wont get any help that ill just leave it again and never finish my school but if i do in person i might have a breakdown or disappoint my parents again i hate that look in their eyes when they found out i had given up on school like im a disappointment what do i do i feel hopeless i wish covid hadnt had happened maybe i wouldve pushed myself to stay at that school if youve gotten your ged or have info on it or advice please please please tell me,1
title explains most of it i wake up in the morning and think fuck im still here fuck another day in my life i never thought i would be this depressed in my life ive had bad anxiety and joked about toaster bath before but now it seems like i genuinely just dont give af i never thought this would be me and that just adds to the sadness i just dont even want to build the strength to keep moving forward the one thing that brought me happiness in my life is gone everything i based my life around i dont care about money or a job or anything like that now it feels like im just forcing myself to do things i dont want to do because its expected of me,1
these last years have taken such a toll on me that i just dont have the will to go on my father was never in my life much and my mother was more interested in alcohol and weed than myself and brothers wellbeing the only paternal support weve really had is from our grandma she has always done what she thought was best for my brother and me though she wasnt always able to give us the emotional support we needed ive struggled with anxiety and depression since i was a teenager and never had any sense of self worth or respect the friends i had were their for convenience we shared some similar hobbies and i was willing to do whatever they needed if that meant we could hang out when i was i started hanging out with a kind of bad crowd we mainly got high and went to festivals and got drunk downtown there were fun moments but eventually an incident happened at a festival and i stopped hanging out with them i did coke for the first time at this festival and they all left me alone for the day afterwards i stopped hanging out with them more so out of getting my head straight but none of then reached out to ke even to this day i still see them from time to time around town and theyve all moved on to become better updmstanding people still hanging out together without me after that happened i focused on work did a bit of job hopping started being healthier lost a ton of weight i was obese from middle school up to and eventually my brother and i moved out into another apartment together with our grandma he soon met a woman and got married and they moved into their own place so it was just me and my grandma i did eventually meet a girl and after a year i also moved into a place with her when i was it was good for awhile but her mom hated me i wasnt extremely religious im not against it in any way but i dont need a book to tell me how to be a good person she judged me from our first meeting especially since i didnt come from a good stable background im glossing over a lot but it had a significant impact on our relationship we live there together for year i dont know when it started but we would get into these intense arguments she had a lot going on with her family and job and along with covid and isolation the stress was too much for us to work through after months of living together we broke up i left the apartment and went back to my grandmas place we tried to stay friends but ive realized that the changes in her personality have become too toxic for me she knows my struggles with my insecurities my depression my anxiety and even my family issues up until yesterday she used that to manipulate me into being there for her emotionally i kept struggling to break away but she would bring up my past mistakes in our relationship and guilt me to continue being there for her anyways i went back to one of my old jobs and was there until this past january i left because i felt like i reached my peak the customers were getting worse we got a new manager who complete changed everything to their liking i was overworked and felt undervalued i didnt have a game plan i just knew that for my mental health i needed to leave since then i havent found any kind of job since i left school i dont hsve any qualifications except for retail fast food and other menial jobs in the past year i gained back all the weight i lost my body has been going through certain issues that i truly cant even afford to go to the doctor for my grandma bless her heart hasnt been too pushy about me finding a job but i can see her irritation in her eyes i know shes concerned about me isolating myself in my room i dont even play games much anymore i just waste my days browsing online looking for jobs and then just laying in bed thinking of my life i have no one close around me i have no friends no so and i cant even talk to my brother about my depression i know hes going through his own stuff and hes tried to get me to play games with him but i feel like he should just focus on himself the last two days ive been contemplating my life my place in the world ive come to the conclusion that i am just someone who doesnt belong im not destined for a good life not even an ok life when i felt it was good it was ripped away from me despite all my efforts to fix everything im starting over from the bottom living with my grandma again overweight jobless and no real worth i always felt so shityy for it but i finally made my peace ive struggled with suicide though a lot lately i was afraid of actually going through with it because of my grandma and brother even my mommombit i know they will be heartbroken i know it will take some time for them to recover but they will eventually my grandma is so emotion strong and my brother while he will be more hurt from it is also stronger than me emotionally he also has his wife there to support him we used to talk about suicide when things were bad and he always said no matter what happened to us he would never be ble to go through with that i used to think i couldnt eitheri guess i truly am a weakling i know itll be hard for them but i feel that their lives will be so much easier once they dont have to worry about me anymore ive made peace with it they were the last things holding me back but i dont feel worried anymore theyll be able to live their lives when im gone and i wont be a burden for them and for myself anymore im exhausted every day is such a struggle to get up and try lately ive been having nightmares theyve gotten worse and i feel this is the only way to stop im tired of fighting im tired of trying ive accepted that im not meant for anything and ive accepted i dont deserve happiness im ready now for the first time in years ive bought some wine i hate wine with a passion but it aas on clearance and i just needed to get my head to stop thinking once she leaves for work tomorrowi think ill just drink myself stulud i dont know whatll happen maybe i wont go through wjth it but this is the first time ive felt good about ending it all i can think of is how itll be overoveri wont have to suffer anymore i wont be a burden anymore i wont be worthless anymore ill be forgotten which i am ok with if you took the time to read this i thank you wholeheartedly i know its a bunch of ramblings but it feels good to get it off my chest i feel like with this i can take that step and i will finally achieve peace i hope if you read this dont be like me i am a weakling but i hope you can use this to push on do what i couldnt do i wish you the best of luck,1
any advice or suggestions on what i should do hes dropped out of college because he have no passion in anything he hates learning and have no friends hes always in his room and refuse to leave he would lock his door and turn off the lights when my parents asked him if he wants to go somewhere he just screamed no repeatedly at them sometimes when we come back home and i check up on him he told me he regretted it and said hes a horrible person i suggested him to get professional help im also seeing a therapist to try to better myself but my brother told me its a waste of time and he doesnt want to talk about his feelings all he does is play pc games from morning to night even till am my mom comes home from her night shift and when she saw that hes still awake they started a screaming match their loud voices would wake me up and i try to stop them and it never works now i just check up on him and try to have a decent conversation with him i would talk about video games with him or other things hes interested but most of the time he yells at me to leave his room i think he has a lot of pressure from my mom she wants him to go to college in the medical or engineer field it might be partially my fault too my mom wanted me to be a nurse but i got a degree in art even my relatives told me you cant have siblings in the creative field there has to be a balance your brother should be in stem i asked my brother and he actually wants to be a writer i feel bad i dont think im a good older sister im i focused on my own issues for a long time now i also tried defending him against my family but he told me to stop my brother ended up yelling at me that im a failure because it took me years to graduate got a useless degree and tons of job rejections so he doesnt want to take any advice from me about college he always tells me this when he wants to be alone because i ended up crying to my room or the bathroom,1
simple question for people with depression how do you feel on alcohol or other drugs if so which drugs how often do you use them do you believe it affects you depression in any way long term short term im interested in any answer from a person who uses drugs on how it affects their depression but particularily people who dont use them regularly does it make you feel happiness does it make you feel things you miss out on in daily life why dont you keep using them of course know a lot of good reasons not to use drugs in daily life even if youre depressed im just interested in the answers,1
so i often have depression episodes that can last for days sometimes even whole weeks i am currently on my fourth day out from work i just lied and said i had the flue but now i just feel horrible and have so much anxiety about having to face my boss who i lied to i dont know how to navigate this anymore and its taking a huge toll on my life i finally have a good job that i like yet it feels like i am just self sabotaging or something i dont know i have had this problem for years now and i just want to be a normal functioning adult how can i end this cycle,1
i used to try and act so upbeat and happy all the time but lately i just cant im miserable all the time i dont have the energy to talk to people anymore i dont have energy to spend time with my friends they probably think im avoiding them im losing the only people close to me because id rather spend my time alone im miserable at work im miserable around friends im miserable at home i just cant put on a happy face anymore i wear my mask all the time because i cant bring myself to smile this shit is eating me alive im so tired of it all,1
so you need a stable social environment to get better but people ditch you when you stop entertaining them so how should this environment look like in the st century when people are obsessed with fun and dont want to deal with issues they dont want to deal with their own issues and they definitely dont want to deal with someone thats not fun so obviously we without a family that cares for us are fucked,1
this fucking word i hate it utterly i can barely bring myself to pronounce it every last one of its four letters what with the shit it entails itll have you entailing rather which is a character wholl never be as respectable reliable and upstanding as youd be had you never asked for for that that thing there in the title you know the one we all need and so desperately at times even though thats not even what a great deal of us needs but really what everyone should have for granted a basic human right youd call it a necessity as eating or drinking or fuckingfucking yes fucking or lest i sound too coarse or even border vagueness as i mention fucking i meant loving what help its love i want love i dont want to be treated as i need a fucking ramp going up a staircase or given a discourse of pity like im disabled somehow or another because im depressed i just want love none but love except great thats even more shameful to ask than help itself and you do it once youre marked for pitiful clinginess death so to publicly ask for help is something lll never dare again oh no i wont you may find yourself comforted warmed even upon your request for help among friends but if youre a man with any kind of zealor anyone with such vigor really then the moment youre elevating yourself up ever so slightly in a competitive manner again that fragility youve shown is going to be used against you in every single fucking regard and youll never make it back to that league you once held your held high on so id rather suffer proud now even if it kills me at least itll be a literal death a clean wipe opposed to this sick sort of castration,1
even only a year ago feels like a dream i was so deluded so arrogant and unaware id do anything to feel that hope again everytime i wake up i have to remind myself that this is all real that i am stuck here and its all my fault everything they said about me was true,1
hey i came to reddit for advice idk i just feel drained from school people girls work i dont know what to do anymore im losing focus of my grades im confused and just tired in general i came here cus i do not have no one else to tell my problems too i have everything i wanted friends family a truck but i just feel empty i cant explain it i just dont know im and yes some people will tell me to be great full for what i have which i am but it doesnt mean im not happy am i selfish i dont do drugs but some times the thought comes to my mind and i wonder would everything be better i have also wondered what would happen if i just disappear i know i would be missed by my friends family siblings but i dont think i would care its selfish i know but im being honest life is on repeat of you know what i mean i wake up go to school get home eat go to sleep and do it all over it again its fucking tiring i have thought of suicide but its a dumb way to go out tbh im only here cus im scared too die and my mom needs me like im great full yes but i just dont wanna be here you know i would never do something that would hurt my mom please can someone just put sense into me or just give me advice anything,1
hello tw suicide depression anxiety i want to start this off by saying im f ever since i was young i dreamt about having an exceptionally great life i dreamt of finding the love of my life being rich etc lately ive seen my brothers getting that kind of life and also lately i was met with anxiety i barely cant sleep at night im extremely depressed because i just have no hope in the future like i feel like ill never live the life i want or find the love of my life because i feel unloved i feel i dont want this to sound stupid but i feel way too smart for some people yet too dumb for others im extremely depressed like i hate how everyone is living their best lives and im stuck in my home with my mentally ill jobless mother depressing unloved without anyone cause i practically have no friends and my brothers just have their own life so im truly alone and i have no hope no will no fun i want to kill myself,1
let me start that i used to feel shame and embarrassment about my depression i used to hate myself and feel like a freak and that nobody else ever went through the feelings i did i was terrified of people finding out i suffered from depression like it would make them think less of me and that i should be avoided and pitied at some point i had a certain epiphany if you will i concluded that depression is a normal thing that affects everyone i have a feeling anyone who says they never get depressed isnt being honest or just afraid of judgement everyone gets depressed and it shouldnt be anything to be ashamed about im aware that although everyone experiences depression it doesnt affect everyone the same some people such as myself have closed themselves off to people and made themselves a victim of this idea that they should feel ashamed of their depression and hide it from everyone lest they be judged and ridiculed for it but not me not anymore at least i think depression should be normalized or at the very least accepted people shouldnt be made to believe theyre broken and need to be fixed depression isnt something that needs to be fixed its something that needs to be understood the truth is my depression isnt going to just go away its a natural human emotion its a part of the human condition and only someone completely devoid of emotion would never go through it i get it it sucks to go through it i know all to well and cant tell you how many times i just wanted to die but i dont regret my depression because i believe it gives my more humility i believe that by being more open and accepting of my depression i can open up to others going through those painful difficult times i can show them that even though depression may never go away for good there are ways to manage it healthily and effectively i think it just starts by learning to understand and accept depression as a normal human emotion that everyone goes through dont ever think youre the only one or that you have it worse than everyone else if i could do it you should be able to too,1
every single day i keep thinking about how emotionally numb i feel about how rich and vibrant life would be if i was not so depressed i constantly feel robbed of my emotions especially after i felt genuine human emotion and joy for just one day i felt happy just to be alive what happened man i wish i could just feel happy to be alive again and feel joy and happiness from the littlest things,1
and i cant get rid of that feeling why do i need to wake up why do i need to have any goals why do i need to live we will all die one day why prolonging the inevitable theres surely nothing after death and theres yet still nothing fun being alive too we live in a world that doesnt care about you and your problems everyone wants you to be productive and useful and when you suddenly understand how useless it all is they call you mentally ill,1
hey guys so my long term partner just broke up with me today i dont blame her i was emotionally crazy and always depressed she was my only friend and my only light sometimes but i know i put her off a lot i understand my faults i usually would go to the gym and stuff but i dont hate this girl or feel wronged if anything i wronged her by taking her for granted either ways i feel all alone i have no one and no one close enough or comfortable enough to talk to and confess my emotions to i guess its just me and my crazy thoughts from now on then,1
i feel so defeated everything that could possibly go wrong in life has gone wrong im not living im just existing nothing brings me joy i cant do it anymore,1
if anyone will be around later tonight just dm me,1

im too tired to carry on university is too difficult my disability is such a burden my mental health is spiralling my acne is so bad i am afraid to look people in the eyes my social anxiety is awful and im such an awkward person ive been sick for months and its made me become super negative and withdraw from my friends im quite shy and it makes people look down on me and ignore me i was bullied all throughout primary school and basically ignored after that i wish a car would hit me and itd be all over quick and simple no pain i know by this point i am the problem and im not blaming anyone else for whats happened to me in my life its just so tiring,1

as the title states i hate my fucking life there is nothing redeemable or meaningful about my existence i clean toilets for just above minimum wage to get by everyday is a sisyphean nightmare i scrub the literal shit just for there to be more shit endless shit such is life its funny because everyone tells me i can do so much more but is that truly so i hate everything about everything yet have no real motivation to change im just so tired all the time little background to paint the pathetic picture im in my late twenties and live with my parents ive had no remaining friends for several years now for the better have had a suspended license for years and my only sibling hasnt talked to me in years my parents and girlfriend are the last remaining positive things in my life yet personal guilt blocks my appreciation of them i honestly dont deserve them why they havent discarded me like everyone else is beyond me im a pathetic selfabsorbed alcoholic blister the only time i dont experience crippling anxiety and the hollowness of my self inflicted sadness is when skirting the line of a blackout i have embarrassed my girlfriend and parents countless times despite my best efforts im not a likeable person even when sober i hate that i have to not drink two days a week otherwise the familiar beast of physical dependence comes knocking on my decrepit door im not sure why im even bothering to write all this its not like im capable or even worthy of change i got cleaned up and worked a step program rigorously for over a year in the past tried to convince myself that i could even make healthy friends and live a normal life i also went on prozac which made only a negligible difference except for the broken dick that facade quickly crumbled once i realized that people like me are simply not meant to be happy i lived in nothing more than a hopeful fantasy all that time in the end there isnt much else to say life just isnt fair and i havent the energy to even complain anymore the yearold who locked yearold me in his garage and shot me with a bb gun is a rich corporate lawyer the highschool teammate who regularly beat my ass is an investment manager for merryl lynch if there werent losers like me then there wouldnt be winners like them,1

my depression has at this point taken everything that was honestly important to me in my life my education is a mess i cant seem to care for or bond with my friends anymore everything that i liked to do i stopped doing and now i have no hobbies i have an awful relationship with my mother so that doesnt help and neither of us cook me mostly because i cant do anything and her idk because shes busy i guess so my eating habits are shit my sleep schedule is reversed at this point and my hiegene is shit too everythings just gross and neglected now and i feel this insurmountable amount of guilt and shame about the fucking embarrassing shithole my life has become and i cant bring myself to go past this feeling that im a waste and that ive let myself down i had many dreams and many expectations i realise that im sentimental and idealistic by nature and i really do let my imagination run wild when it comes to how life is supposed to look like but ive never imagined this even in my pessimistic scenarios i avoid going to my therapist because i dont believe i want to get better anymore i dont know if i even can and i wont let anyone help me or choose to get better and it just feels like im watching this person live my life for me and i disagree with everything theyre doing but somehow im not strong or bothered enough to stop them ive built this cycle that keeps me afraid and frozen all the time so i never do anything that could potentially improve my situation because that requires stakes and effort and faith and im afraid of all of those now i just find myself grieving who i am which i know sounds completely ridiculous but i will literally look at pictures of me and i swear to god i will grieve how pretty i look or how i talented i was at something or how fun a certain memory was as if im no longer here or not alive like im in deathbed wishing i had done different and keeping myself in the position of a perpetual martyr its really fucking weird,1
i wake up every day and log into my online college i go to work i shower and some days i brush my teeth but most days i cant sometimes i put on new clothes but usually i dont i go in my room and i turn off the lights and lay in bed on my phone i eat every other day i sleep when i cant take being away anymore my foster parents are moving to miami so they passive aggressively kicked me out im i dont have any dreams i dont have anything anymore i think of suicide as a simple solution im not sad i just feel nothing i cant remember when i was truly inspired i cant remember the last time i cared im a burden to everyone i know it just let me die already,1
im only but ive struggled with very bad depression anxiety and adhd and it honestly sucks i hate every second of it and ive even used recreational drugs but antidepressants help i took bupropion xl mg for four days and i was happy i went from suicidal to happy in two days medication can help and if you dont want to because you want to muse drugs example when your on it is much easier to stay sober and staying sober helps a lot with keeping a stable mood i just wanted to say that if you need help there is something out there for you i used to be against antidepressants but they help so much its crazy i was happy and looked forward to the next day instead of waking up with dread i would literally go to bed early i used to make up excuses to not get the help i needed because if im being honest in was scared to be happy i was so used to being depressed i was scared of change but when you get on an antidepressant that mood lift makes you realize that change is what i needed and it was just my depression holding me back,1
i dont know why im even sad but i have been like this for so long that now it doesnt matter im just tired,1
i cant face going back on an ssrisnri ive tried most of the common alternatives they all turn me into a zombie with zero memory in short order except mirtazapine that turns me into a nomemory zombie with food cravings doctor is also willing to try secondline treatments of vortioxetine trintellix bupropion wellbutrin ampxb is buproprion a bad combo for someone who suffers with depressionpoor sleep driven by anxiety and chronic stressraised cortisol im mainly concerned about the impacts on sleep although from what i can tell it seems ir may be better,1
what is the point of taking a day to yourself as a parent its like a day pass from prison you know you just have to go back how is any break supposed to feel reviving when the life you leave and also the one you take with you feels worthless and pointless im basically just going to feel shitty in a different location self care is worth shit,1
its like i had a breath of fresh air i was sober i was productive i was task oriented i got constructive things done and even worked on hobbies just a smidge it was so nice to breathe yesterday today i started off well and i kept giving myself projects to do i repotted some things and made the mistake of posting a pic on reddit i wanted to share a cute lil repot i did now i know i cant take things on reddit personally and some people left positive comments but some people were judging what i did and telling me i was wrong for it i sort of lashed out and started to respond to them but someone told me off for it and i realized i was being unreasonable its not the post or the comments that got me its just that i was trying to do well and be happy and share a little of myself with something or someone outside of my bubble im a home maker f and im alone all day i have long distance friends but no one nearby my friends dont really check on me we are all mentally ill and i usually put myself on the back burner and stay quiet so i think they lean on me and dont view me as needing helpi wish they would reach out more and ask me how i am i feel so incredibly alone i have felt such immense depths of pain in my life i am still fighting to grow and heal i wish i couldve taken my therapist with me to the new state when i moved i wish i had just one person who understood the depths of what i feel and how crazy and chaotic my brain is i wish i could friggin breathe right now i wish it was yesterday again,1

my close friend and flatmate has depression and she has in the past two days out of nowhere shut herself out from everybody including me who prior to this hung out with her almost daily she has also stopped going to university i am worried and dont know how to approach trying to talk to her as she has not reciprocated any messages of going for a walk or for food i know it may be best to leave her be but as her friend i want to at least talk to her face to face and help her with any emotional support or comfort especially since we live in the same flat ampxb should i just knock on her door or just leave her be and keep texting to check up on her every once in a while i do understand that depression can sometimes be better dealt with alone as not to be overwhelmed but i cant help but feel worried for her ampxb all her replies to messages of concern are i am alright and along those lines any advice would be greatly appreciated,1

weird how spring is approaching quickly yet i can feel the darkness coming again in the mornings i wake up as late as possible so i can spend the early hours in my bed either unconscious or dreaming without pain without the burden of reality the rest of the day i spend in a haze of hating myself escaping reality through videogames and starving myself losing weight makes me feel good again i deserve the feeling of an empty stomach and at the same time restricting my calories is the only thing that i can control in my life these days im very forgetful too i forget appointments and run late for the very few things i have left in my life my family gets angry at me a lot to them i am a nuisance they dont understand why i am slacking they dont know that i hate being alive and their anger makes me want to end my consciousness even more the evenings are the worst though because they are filled with regrets im wasting time im ruining my s im isolating myself from the world and soon i wont have anyone left but i cannot change im powerless against the sadness it doesnt feel like spring,1
i want to talk to my friends and they talk back and we have a fun and nice time i want to be happy and drink water and get up early and go to university every day and go to work i cant do it i have support except my girlfriend but i cannot class her as any kind of psychological support i am going back on my meds soon because i was okay for a while wo them but ive been really really bad its like i have a baseline feeling of sadness and not good but then it really worsens for no reason just from the most random triggers i want to be fucking normal my social skills have been fucking depreciating so bad aswell like i just want to have a nice chat maybe but i just push people away and i want to not do that,1
its just a constant struggle the degree isnt even that valuable and i havent been to my classes for a couple weeks now i wake up and sit in the shower for an hour make some food and play games i have two dissertations due in may along with other assignments and exams no one seems to believe im depressed my boyfriend says im not mentally ill im just going through a hard time but everyone else handles it better than me i have to work at a bar thats open til am on the weekends and i finish work at then a half hour walk back so at the best of times i fall fall at i know that this job is making my mental health worse but i dont have long left at uni now theres no point in quitting in the uk the government give you a maintenance loan to help pay rent and cover living costs most people get around k per year i get k because of my parents income but they dont even make that much and they cant help me financially the k doesnt even cover the rent for my place so my part time job is paying rent food laundry transport clothes when i need them etc and other things im managing to save up my money without spending over budget but thats about the only thing that seems worth it actually making money with university there is nothing to motivate me other than guilt or shame my first year of uni was during the pandemic and the second year was heavily affected as well third year is just full of strikes the free university bus never shows up so i miss my classes when i actually try its all so demotivating the one time i opened up to a friend properly he distanced himself from me because i didnt text him back for a couple days and he took it personally even after i explained everything to him to be honest he was a terrible friend anyway but ill save you the details my parents dont understand it theyre in denial that their kid is depressed and anxious probably because they are too but my mum always tells me im just being silly when i open up so not much hope there i just wish i could sleep through it all i feel like i have no control over my life at the moment and i feel like a waste of oxygen i dont know if this would be helpful to anyone but i hope someone else can relate,1

where do i even begin ig st for apologising as this will be a mess and ive never used reddit before so idek if im even doing this correct i just cant do this shit no more like im pathetic and my life is so deplorable that im alone no cares for me every hates me and im a failure even to my parents ive already tried killing myself once before and i couldnt even do that right clearly that was like months ago and nothings changed in fact its probs worse somehow i just dont know what to do from being friendless through my own doing from being hated by my family from being attempted robbed by knife point less than a week ago from being a complete failure and disappointment i just dont know anymore funny thing is everything is so much worse than months ago but im still here fighting as if things r gonna get better when ik they aint all i do is overthink abt every lil interaction conversation and how life could be such better that it consumes all of my energy to the point where i cant concentrate at school bc all i can think abt is killing myself and how i just should what makes it worse is that this is only the nd time ive ever talked abt this shit bc i cant not even to myself whenever some asks how i am once in a millenia i cant be honest i just smile and say generic bs when im not ok i just bury my head in the sand and pray it gets better that itll go away it never fucking does not in yrs it hasnt so y should it change now the voices r winning and idk what to do i just want to die the world would probs be better off anyway let me go thru spotify once more and i think im done ty and sry,1
whats it all about i can get by ok outside even sitting in a room with friends or family at college etc but once in my room and i spend a lot time there as not very social and introverted i end up fapping all the time as it makes me feel good but its not healthy or ideal i used to be happy playing video games movies tv etc but not getting into them so much now i feel as im older not a teenager and at parent house will be for at least more years due to finances and study perhaps its not right im not sure even if i had a flat would it be any different when i have a gf i dont even care about sex but single i just think about it all time its weird haha tbh when im alone i find i just want to fap and think of sex maybe having a gf would help that aspect i dont know even still im just not losing myself i movies and video games proffering to study etc which is fine but should have fun stuff to i make music but cant be bothered that either i also notice my hair thinning and think about that all the time which gets me down a lot and makes me feel ageing maybe a root cause of my depression anyway overall its like i can walk about my house fine but as soon as i go into my bedroom my mood drops so low and my room is nice open lots of fun things tv games music etc maybe at my age bedroom just for sleeping now but still it is what is why cant i be happy room maybe i just not got a good balance due to my crap hair i stopped going out at night or weekends which was fun and common when younger i just feel ugly old and depressed to go out now when i used to go out i found that i was happy home in room for few days as no desire to go out then go out and repeat now i never go out so could be issue to so i feel always in my room balance was better before also not just my hair but im older and lost many friends who have moved on married had kids etc so going out is not really a thing anymore anyway im so lost right now,1
i over eat amp under eat cant sleep at night and sleep during the day when i have an episode i hate to call other people because i dont want to bring them down sometimes i feel like i cant do anything but lay in bed i always worry about something bad happening to me even though i have hobbies and try do make healthy eating decisions etc just ranting because im crying for no apparent reason and need to vent i hope everyone is ok,1
sorry in advanced for the rant of anyone even reads this lol m i used to use this app a lot to talk people out of hurting themselves or give people a chance to vent when i was really depressed as a coping mechanism i guess i started feeling better as i graduated high school with honors and began moving towards an exciting and new time in my life there were ups and downs sure but i was probably happier than ive been in years since entering college i found new hobbies met amazing friends worked out etc i even finished the semester with all as thats why it hurts even more to still be in this place nearly all of my online friends ditched me like they always do half of my real life friends just stopped showing any interest in me i cant find a reason to give af about school and ive stopped all but one of my hobbies piano its like once i get a taste of feeling okay everything falls apart and i know what i need to do to fix it but i just feel so alone and i need so badly to share my thoughts with someone but despite being in a school of ten thousand plus people theres not one person i feel okay turning to for help i just want it to end it never gets better and it hurts so much because i have a lot of love for other people and i just never seem to have that love reciprocated i never leave anyone but people always get bored of me and move on to the next i just want someone to love me man,1
the zoloft appeared to stop working months ago after years so i stopped cold turkey and switched to wellbutrin which i was supposed to take with the zoloft but now i feel even worse than before its been over a week and the crying self hate and thoughts of self harm and suicide are too much i just wish i could have some mental stability i cant deal with this anymore i feel alone in this experience and consumed with horrible thoughts should i go back on the zoloft and take wellbutrin and zoloft together i need to be mentally well asap so i can focus on my responsibilities but its been difficult,1
seriously theres nothing keeping me in this area anymore so why stay im seriously tempted to just full the tank and just drive and drive with nothing other than my thoughts to occupy me,1
i am struggling with going out of bed in the morning and starting the day when i dont have to leave the house right away besides drinking my coffee i absolutely dont have a routine in the morning i just dont know what to do with myself after i turned off my alarm i wanted to ask you guys what are the small things that help you in the morning do you have specific constant morning routines how do they look any other thoughts about that topic,1

i been dealing with depression for a long time now since i was about or so my teen years were the worse for me as thats when i actually felt suicidal as around that time my parents were having a divorce and i was failing school never got the treatment i needed for this as my mother didnt like the idea of having to use drugs to make me better and never got me therapy either so i was left to somehow fix myself on my own for many years which i had to do many many google searches to figure out what is wrong with me right now my depression has been getting worse due to my godfather passing away on new years and i had to put down my year old cat weeks ago and that has been hitting me hard i also dont have a job sadly to keep me busy and i dont have too many friends that live close to me that i can go out and do stuff withi do still try to talk to them through text tho but i was thinking on finding some kind of distraction like exercise but i havent found that motivation on moving forward yet i did finally set up a therapy appointment for myself but it took a lot of work to even set it up im kinda just spitting word vomit out right now but one of my coping mechanism is maladaptive day dreaming which if you dont know what that means is a behavior where a person spends an excessive amount of time daydreaming often becoming immersed in their imagination lately i have been stuck in my head a lot making up a bunch of stories and just wishing i could be in my perfect world that i made up and sadly its just making me even more depressed because i know i would never be able to live in that world like i would imagine myself being a superhero with powers but then i end realizing superpowers will never exist and i end up sad so basically i was wondering if anyone else has dealt with this before and what you did to make it stop because i want this to stop very badly as with my own selfawareness i can see where our world is a nice place and you can experience a lot of things but i never have the energy or motivation to experience it sorry if this is a lot to read but im at my breaking point and i dont know what to do with myself and i really want to make this emptiness inside me to go away im tired of living in a dull boring world,1
i feel like shit i feel like i have nothing left i can do nothing i have no options and i ahve no choice over my own life i dont want to exist everything in life feels too stressful and like too much i cant get a job i am out of school i dont have the capability or option to to either i have no skills and no motivation for anything i used to enjoy nobody understands more nobody knows the real me i cant talk to anybody my family dont understand i have not friends i see no reason to continue i am a burden on my family theyd be better off not having to deal with me i basically dont exist so there is no reason for me to try to i want help but i cannot get any i cannot reach out i am unable of talking to people i literally cannot speak to most people my family wont belive me or take me seriously and im scared of them i want to die but if i do then i will die as somebody else i just want to be me but i cannot i have been trying for so long i have tried to keep going but i am reaching a point where i feel like im going insane i want to scream and destroy something i want this feeling to just end but it wont i dont want this life i wish i wasnt me i wish i were just normal or just had never existed i should have never existed we should never have been twins i am only an inconvenience i am disgusting i dont deserve my life i dont deserve to eat i dont deserve my family i dont deserve help i dont deserve to be loved,1
might delete later in case they see this i dont think theyre a reddit user but just in case i really need advice on how to help my friend i thought it would be easy since ive struggled with depression for about years now but i just cant find the words to give any helpful advice im really worried about them and theyre addicted to a few things though they dont think that they have a problem so im scared that whatever i say or do is going to make it worse especially since they often talk about wanting to commit suicide all i want is to help them but they often stop talking about it once i start to sound worried there isnt anyone else that i can ask for help at this point so im hoping to maybe get some advice from here sorry if this is kind of vague i really dont want them to find out,1
i cant keep going on what can i say im depressed very hard to find motivation to move on to complete tasks im in college now and studying became so hard i cant describe in school i was one of the best students and a couple years later remembering and learning even a tiny pieces of new information is extremely hard even if its something relatively easy back in the daysi could read for hours not only fiction literature but books about history science and everything now im barely completing the minimum to stay in college im trying to be more socially active go outside go to gym try to learn something new every day but everything stays the same well not exactly the same because it just keeps getting harder i dont believe ill be able to finish college find loveim really bad at social interactions and meeting new people find a job and become happy every day it is only harder and harder to move on and deal with problems ive also fallen in love with a girl that dont find me interesting i hate being in love because it never plays well and in the end all relationships i had ended badly my last gf dumped my on my birthday more than a year ago and i spent next half year to recover from that than i have fallen in love with this girl we had some nice conversation and i did fall in love but she didnt of course im not blaming her for that but damn i havent fallen in love like this since the second grade my feelings for her are so strong i usually lose the ability to speak adequately and formulate thoughts when i am around her on the bright side two weeks ago i bought myself an acoustic guitar which was my little dream for a couple of years and im making some progress in that direction and this despite the fact that never in my life ive done anything even relatively connected to music but i like it peace to everyone who read this to the end hope youre doing okay,1
its been a rough day already and it only started hours ago i always struggle with self doubt but today the thoughts are here tenfold struggling with the urge to sh i dont feel like i can talk to anyone it just feels like im crying wolf and it makes me feel manipulative i dont know if i want to cry or sit and stare blankly ive never been a dissociative person but days like today make me wish i was im tired of feeling things and being overwhelmed by all my thoughts i just want them to stop,1

ive always felt like something was missing in my life it was a nagging feeling a sense of emptiness that i couldnt shake no matter what i did but then as i wrote my thoughts and feelings onto the page i felt the presence of someone reading these words it was as if there was someone out there who was willing to listen to me to understand the things that i had been carrying around for so long as you continue to read these words unfiltered and unvarnished i feel a sense of hope hope that someone out there is willing to spend time getting to know me to understand the thoughts and feelings that i keep hidden from the world its a strange feeling to know that someone is reading the things that go through my mind but its also incredibly comforting to know that im not alone anymore that someone out there cares enough to read what i have to say i dont feel lonely anymore because i know that youre out there reading these words its like were connected in a way thats hard to explain like were sharing something special and so as you continue to read i want you to know that i appreciate you i appreciate the time youre taking to understand me to think about the things that im saying youre showing me that im interesting enough to be worth reading and that means more to me than you could ever know i feel loved in a way thats hard to explain but its real and its powerful so thank you dear reader for spending this time with me thank you for giving me hope for showing me that theres more to life than just the empty feeling that ive been carrying around for so long,1
when i was going on i was going to end it before my th birthday ihad it all planned out and without triggering anyonegiving any ideas i knew it was going to work and be successful i remember going to where i was about to do it i felt such a rush so much excitement and relief knowing that it will all be over in a few months i decided that i was going to do it either months before my birthday so it gives my family enough time to recover and quickly get over it then my birthday wont be difficult as it will be a while since ive passed a boy in my class also told me that when i die he will throw a huge party and invite the entire year group this made me more excited to end it gave me that motivation knowing that no one would care and instead see it as such an amazing thing that im not here for once in my life im doing the right thing i wanted to know more about it and would always bring it up to him in the class asking whos going to be invited can anyone bring a plus and where it would be suddenly though life just happened my mom was in an abusive relationship she couldnt take it anymore and so we had to move away to start a new life new school everything i didnt realise any of this was happening until we actually left in that moment i just wanted to be there for my mom she would be crying a lot and looked so drained in a new environment having to start all over again my original plan of ending it back home i just knew in my heart it wouldnt work and my mom really needed me so i stayed alive im now and its gotten better for everyone but me i still have these thoughts and i regret not doing it even after everything that happened which i know just makes me a bad person im in therapy rn but its early days i idk if i should tell her all this oh well some support would be great though do any of you feel this way and wish you just did it,1

there is a persistent feeling of uneasiness and insecurity that permeates so many of my actions i feel like somehow unconsciously im sabotaging my own future academically socially romantically it feels like im constantly out of the loop on some essential piece of information thats going to come back and bite me in the future and ruin any chances of living a comfortable life all i really want is to be modestly happy and to have the space to enjoy the few things that make me feel that life is worth living family love reading cooking hiking etc but there is this never ending feeling of insecurity that ill never achieve this i know there are no guarantees and that our future is really out of our hands but it just gets me down so much knowing that theres a possibility ill be alone in the future or ill end up too poor to engage in my passions or that my life will become an endless stream of meaningless labour and bills or that ill reach a point where my opportunities in life have irrevocably passed and im trapped in a depressive meagre existence forever probably sounds dramatic but i just cant help this way of thinking i always feel like theres something better i could be doing some area of my life that needs to be optimised some chain of decisions that once met will lead me to the best possible outcome at the end of it all it just makes me want to withdraw and give up because of all the pressure,1

i am exhausted the thought of getting out of bed most days feels extremely difficult the thought of making myself food and eating feel impossible i used to not be able to go to sleep hungry but more recently i do it every day if i am tired i am going straight to bed even if i am starving sometimes when i take vitamins my brain thinks that is enough to keep off my hunger while i sleep a few months ago i completely lost my appetite and didnt eat for over a day it went away and my appetite came back but recently ive been eating only one or two meals a day not because i want to lose weight i just am so tired if its not fast food i can barely eat it i cant eat a lot anymore sometimes the smell of food is sickening even if im hungry most of my meals are fast food i am constantly hungry but it doesnt bother me as much anymore has anyone else felt like this,1

hi guys first time on this sub im here because i cant talk about this with anyone anymore my gf is tired of hearing my depressed talk family too i dont blame them ive always suffered from anxiety but its been a year since ive been experiencing depression im not diagnosed not been to therapy ive been broke and have to eat too but its an overwhelming feeling i feel tired i dont wanna do anything its hard for me to enjoy anything i feel like im a failure im about to be and i dont have shit my career as an artist sucks im not getting no clients and also its extremely hard to put myself out there cause i feel like im so miserable people will be able to tell i dont wanna see people anymore i hate to being asked how im doing i feel its exhausting for my loved ones to deal with me and i cant really blame them its exhausting for me too maybe they dont have the tools to understand im never hungry anymore something triggered me yesterday a friend of mine is getting engaged and i hate myself cause i really wanna be happy for them and i am but also served as a reminder for me im in a very low point in my life and i dont know how to get out it makes me feel so miserable when i think of how miserable i ended up to be if that makes sense and ive tried to do certain things learning new things to distract myself but i still have this overwhelming sadness on me and i really try to ser a way this will get better but seems to only get worse i really dont see the right path my dreams and aspirations are all broken and i can only cry when thinking about them and i know theres plenty people in probably worse situations than myself and i feel like maybe i shouldnt be complaining but i dont know what to do theres so many layers to this i often ser my belongings and think of whatll people do with them if i die i try to imagine the world without me and itll really wont be missing anything im thinking about my death every day now and im afraid im writing this here cause i dont feel i have people to talk about this anymore and just wanted to let it out i tried t summarize it as much as i could,1
i feel overwhelmed to the point of exhaustion when im at work i have to be all the time but i cant do that ive tried looking at other jobs with the same or better pay and same hours but nothing has worked out i cant keep up with my household chores or duties i feel like im a burden every time i ask for help i feel like theres no point but to give up,1
i dont know what to do with my life anymore i went to college just because i couldnt see myself working i was able to get into my dream college but not on the course i wanted they rejected me because there was too many people i do enjoy mostly just tolerate the subject im studying but i hate the thought of actually putting in hours of work just to get a passing grade when i get home i cant think of anything but sitting down and watching something stop thinking about my real life that has nothing to offer i dont study at all i used to draw every day and i must say im pretty good at it but i just dont see the point anymore my friends are not interested in my life whatsoever even though im always asking how they are doing and if they need any help i dont remember the last time somebody texted me just to talk my parents say they love me but i cant really believe it thanks to their lack of interest in my childhood money is not a problem for me they never said that they want me to pay them but i feel like i should put in at least a little bit of money i got sick two days ago and all i hear when my mother gets home is that the dishes are not clean they ignore my confessions im trans get mad at me and then say that im lazy for sitting and not doing enough which is kind of true all i do everyday is to think that one day it will get better but its hard to keep going i cant look in the mirror there are days where i just dont eat because i dont see the point i dont take showers i dont take care of my face anymore i just feel like an intruder in this world useless piece of trash thats just thrown around a cheerup plushie thats useful when somebody needs a hug or a punching bag when somebody wants to shout at it i dont see my future all i see is how miserable i am,1
i have nothing to offer to this world im never had a job or done anything to contribute to society i did sort of ok at college mainly studied it software but even then i had no idea of what job i wanted what my career path would be with this lack of guidance i tried to go to supported internship places for a few years im always told that because of my autism i need support they got me some internships at various places cafe photography shop printers shop charity shop but i never felt useful i always felt like i was too slow and in the way of the actual useful people there that were just trying to do their job i lead with my job history like this because it seems to be all society cares about at every turn it seems like people are talking about their productivity and their life is based around that which makes me feel bad because i havent been productive since i left college in i have no motivation to do anything most people work because they need money to live somewhere eat and survive but im a spoilt asshole who mooches off of their mother we live on benefits which easily pay the bills and allow us to live a very comfortable life which i constantly feel bad about because most people my age i see struggling to even make ends meet but this is how it is i guess im sorry sometimes things such as a new video game im looking forward to or getting to hang out with a friend keeps me going and gives me at least enough motivation to not just lie in bed all day scrolling facebook or sleeping but recently i havent really had that i play video games because its something to do but im rarely excited about them these days i very rarely like a couple times a year if im lucky do anything with a friend because it seems like im always the one that has to ask to go out and do anything with them but i dont want to bother them by asking that its lucky that i even have any friends the rare friendships i have arise from me finding someone who has things in common with me because if we dont have likes dislikes personality traits etc in common i cant think of anything to talk to them about and somehow finding the courage and drive to speak up to talk to them and try to befriend them which isnt easy because im too stupid to think of stuff to say a lot of the time and my voice is really difficult for people to understand but then because of a lack of me maintaining them the friendships usually fall apart people usually have much more interesting and less depressing friends than me that theyd rather spend time with i guess maybe i should seek help i have done in the past ive had appointments with therapists im lucky enough to live in the uk with free healthcare my deepest sympathies go to those who dont have this luxury and have to go into debt just to have someone to talk about their mental and emotional struggles but because im so inarticulate and slow and my thoughts are so scattered it takes me a while to think of what to talk about and the sessions only allow so much time so usually not that much comes of it and i leave feeling unsatisfied and what the therapist says to me usually dont really help which is my fault because im fucking beyond help i sometimes tell my best friend whats wrong and she tries to help but this is basically just me using her as a therapist which is shitty of me and shes too nice to tell me to shut up and stop being so depressing all the time i feel like this is driving her away which would be horrible because it would be extremely difficult for me to find new meaningful friendships im not sure where id go to make friends and then theres the matter of me finding what to say and my voice but the point im getting towards is im not sure why people should care i struggle with depression but so do a lot of people and those people probably actually have skills and the potential to actually do something with their life i feel like its selfish for me to feel like i deserve help when people suggest things to me that might help me to feel better i never feel the motivation to actually do them im stuck in my comfort zone i guess of just lying in bed occasionally playing video games when i can find the motivation to even do that eating and sleeping im a completely useless person with nothing to offer society i always have been why should anyone care about me i should just be left to die,1

ive been struggling with depression for a few years now particularly when my mom passed years ago yet this month has been brutal i lost my dream job after years there due to budget cuts i know that i was one of the top performers there but obviously that wasnt visible to the person making that decision also this week my romantic partner whom i am completely in love with told me she isnt interested in me anymore i dont understand why but im also not surprised i was reaching way above my station with her so i always knew she would move on eventually but it still broke my heart i feel abandoned and alone then on top of that i constantly feel like a failure and a disappointment to the people who do love me and like im a poison slowly eating away at those around me and destroying my relationships i hate myself so much i remember when i used to be happy when i used to be confident but that seems impossible these days,1

what do you yall do when waiting for a therapist on waitlist or when therapy is not working i am hanging on by a thread and cant find a good therapist i have been at this going on yrs i have been optimistic and from what i found out therapy doesnt really work and i have gotten the same feedback from other ppl despite hearing that i have went into therapy myself and experienced the similar things i am getting no where and have actually developed new problems since going to therapy,1
alright i have to get this out basically my mother had gaslit me for a long time taking control over my life and emotionally abusing me by always blaming me for everything and getting my father on her side so that he would blindly support her this went on for multiple years and stopped at some point as far as i know idk if i have just gitten blind to it it was not too long after all of it that she started saying that she could not remember any of it this has gotten to a point that i even started questioning my own memory of my childhood i often find myself questioning if i remember something right just because of this and i cant really get myself to trust her even getting scared of her sometimes that she might do something to me i also remember wanting to jump out the window at like age the intend was there but i think it was also to see if my mother cared i ended up not doing it because her reaction was just nothing i didnt expect her to just not care at all i also had a lot of pressure due to my grades being very bad i at one point got even worse grades due to me trying to escape into my fantasy that did go on for about years therapy could have helped but no one thought of that my grades eventually got better and i graduated and am now at university im currently trying to get therapy and hopefully come to terms with everything in atleast some way,1
what is your reaction when people vent or tell their pathetic and sad life to you like for example they live in the street or whatever and they ask you what u would do if that was you and youre so weak that youre already laughing at how quickly you wouldve kys in this situation like you dont even do it on purpose but u laugh because your life is objectively so much less tragic but youre kinda like bro i could nevaaaaah bc i feel like this of the time i cant do the easiest thing like just go out and study for more than months without encountering situations that just proves me i dont belong in this societyworld im so so so tired but theres a fucking thing that just tolds me i dont deserve to die but i mean thats a lie everyone deserves it especially me idk what to do to not suffer and not kms i dont like anything anymore ive been thinking the same thing since im i dont have a passion dont have a purpose and im fucking angry with everyone im actually really jealous of people getting out of depression because thats what shows theyre normal ppl that are getting sad when something v sad happens to them its not my case i dont like this world and i dont wanna live in it idk it makes me sick to see ppl wake up everyday to do things i will never ever want to do in my life like wtf you obtain by watching sunsets and walking and just wake up everyday its boring theres no purpose wtf im so pissed rn sometimes i even picture myself in if i would have lived the same way as my parents and i know i would kill myself instantly i dont picture myself to be happy ever i even have a boyfriend for years now and im even more sad the only thing that makes my life a little better is drugs music porn alcohol and sex and since i have a boyfriend sex is so boring and even now that we are in a open relationship i dont even have the motivation to see people i used to live for flirting with guys before i really had nothing else that made me feel good now idk i just feel like a depressive person going through a depression sometimes i cant even get out of bed to roll a joint bc i have no strength i dropped out of school a lot and i have nothing to offer to this word officially bc unofficially i know im smart i know how to help people i could have made myself useful but ppl dont let me show them bc i have no diplomas or anything to show them my worth even tho ppl want me somewhere i end up burn out int and disappearing bc deep down i dont wanna live this life period also i have a very strong sense of value and i find so fucking pathetic the fact that anyone can just think theyre smart and could be useful while being actually just a loser all their life as an example my boyfriend which is even dumber than me is always thinking he can be rich and can enter any school thanks to me he knows he set his expectations too high but he believes he can get rich af without knowing a single notion in finance or business courses he doesnt even have a ged equivalent at and their friends and even parents says thinking is not his specialty like wtf thats why im also so mad at him bc hes disposed to be a loser but unlike me hes happy like a fucking moron idk thats just too much now he wants to go live abroad and guess what that stupid moron never ever thought about that in his entire life so he doesnt know any other cultures or languages except our french and he still thinks he can get a job in a country like singapore canada switzerland the us anyway hes a pure reflection of how much my life is a disaster mentally he is the opposite of what ive ever wanted and supported even politically hes just following the trends he believes what anybody says as long as its in a video anyway i wanna die but i dont even hate him enough to do that to him i feel pity for him but im the one whos sad wtf,1
just last year i was diagnosed with chronic depression i was given antidepressants but i hated how i physically feel after taking it it made me feel worse dizziness and nausea are just a few i was asked to go back see the doctor january but i didnt want to this time i promised myself will be better year as was a shitshow for me i wanted to get and feel better i worked out a lot did a lot of fun things enjoyed old and new hobbies but then at some point when all of the things i do are done im back at the pit of despair sometimes i go out to new places and document everything enjoyed a lot of alone times because yeah it was fun but most of it was the reason of i dont know until when my life will be i do feel shit i have so much to be grateful for and i feel guilty to feel this way but unfortunately i do i have to distract myself to avoid killing myself how fun is that lol i used to enjoy my alone and quiet time now i still do but quietidk sometimes im now im afraid of my own thoughts tonight i laid down the floor looked at the whole size mirror and stared at myself as if i was a dead person with open eyes it felt so real it feels like i am seeing the body in the mirror but i dont actually see myself it feels like my soul left hahaha idk if it makes sense so many things to be grateful for but i just feel so empty so tired i just wanna rest its funny how i also start singing szas song kill bill but i changed the lyrics to i just killed myself not the best idea i wish it was that easy to snap back be okay again genuinely okay but nope it doesnt work that way tho so yeah i just wanna let it out here i really barely dont open up to people even my family and friends about my problems yet alone my depression i just dont think theyd understand and also i know they have so much on their shoulders i dont wanna add up oh yeah check ur friends who are happy and as if all is well it might be just sort of a mask and do check urself too but really i feel a little better letting it out here tho i think,1
my son is dead i wail into the void that was the crowd of people the echo rummaging through their dead bodies i grap my hair ripping it as hard as i can to make the thundering pain in my mind cease for just a moment i look up and run to the door to find a room i fit in but i do not fit in my body it is attached deep in my mind inescapable i want it to disappear please just make it stop i can not bear it it cuts my heart the very fabric of the person that i am in half i break into a thousand pieces only for every piece to break into a thousand peices again and again there is nothing i wake up reminded from that moment to the moment i sleep i hurt myself by remembering him but forgetting him is worse weeks go by how can i live with this pain every day every day i think of joining him but how could i do this to his sisters i have been trapped in my life with no way out but to endure this unimaginable indescripable relentless constant real pain my dreams are nightmares but at least i see him there how can i let go how can i let go of my baby please i just want him back i just want to tell him how much i love him how much he meant to me to take back all the bad things i did and give him all the good things i just need see him once more please please just let me see him i wake up sleep is the only place i find solace torturous solace every one moves on but how could they i lost my world every part of me aches for completeness i never knew i needed i stand up putting on the uniform that tells me i am part okay okay enough to live on but it is a clowns costume and i sewed it myself and i look around and people give me their well meaning words and remind me of the real world its ridicolous roles i have to get back to playing why would i care about this utterly meaningless drivel i want my son back please i can not go on please it hurts so much ampxb excuse the sloppy writing,1
i really want to cry i want to sob for an hour until my head hurts but honestly at this point im not able to i feel awful and shitty but i cannot let it out i want to cry and scream but i cant do it without faking it like those cringe youtubers that yell and fake being scared when playing video games and when searching for sad videos to make myself cry all of them are cringe boomer shit with stock violin and this is so sad like if you agree titles which completely distracts me and makes me want to turn it off,1
im really trying to quit im smoking my last cigarette today i started smoking because of my depression and i just didnt care if i died but now i really wanna quit smoking help please,1
i have a noose in my room,1
im a m raised in a close knit semistrict religion only surrounded by that community i had a rough childhood with mentally ill parents i left and traveled around the world at and developed some ptsd from a few situations i came back got involved with a very toxic deceptive woman she had untreated bpd and this got me outcasted from my religion which meant all of my friends and family then her and i broke up the same week and i ended up homeless for months isolated many more situations continued to disturb my life and traumatize me but now im no longer in a toxic relationship but my depression is so bad i dont even have thoughts in my head anymore only rumination or flashbacks i dont know how to socialize i still never hear from my family or all of my old friends anymore only now have i been able to begin starting over after losing my whole support system and i dont even know where to start im scarred from all relationships my mood swings anxiety and social issues are all over the board i dont know where to even start,1
turns out i reached months without sh a few days ago and didnt even notice thats the longest ive been clean in almost years and usually i would feel proud like i do every milestone but i just feel like shit i can feel myself getting worse again and its just getting too hard to resist the urge my anxiety has been through the roof lately which really doesnt help i cant talk to any of my friends or family because i just feel comfortable and honestly i just feel so alone in the world i have so many things i wanna do and so many reasons to keep on going yet they just dont feel like enough lately i thought this year things would be better and if things got bad again i would just force myseld to be happy turns out that itself can make you go down a downwards spiral life aint great now so anyone got any advice i could really use it,1
i guess a little backstory for me i was diagnosed with depression and adhd if thats at all relevant a year or two back and have been medicated on and off since but no matter if im medicated or not i cant help but want to sleep all the time like im not always that tired but sometimes ill get a very slight wave of drowsiness and take that as an opportunity to just cozy up in my bed and lay down i dont go on my phone laying in my bed i just lay there sometimes ill lay there with my eyes closed for a few minutes on and off ill suddenly feel a little more awake but be too comfortable to want to get up or feel so slightly tired that i wanna just lay down and fix it but i kind of like it like i know that if i tell people i want to sleep all day theyll often just say its depression and that i dont want to exist or something like that i want to exist i just only ever feel so slightly motivated for hr at a time and i live with my mother so i dont have much real reason to get out and do anything because she seems completely fine with supporting me which i still often feel bad about still depending on her and small triumphs like doing my laundry or cleaning my room cant be it im supposed to be an adult im supposed to have a job im supposed to have any kind of relationship with people i dont even have my license i dont even know what to call this asking for advice rant doubting my own depression either way i think i liked examining how im feeling a little bit,1
this feels like such a cycle going to classes and trying not to break down in public as im constantly being asked to help those around me my friends are constantly expecting me to be their therapists or sholder to cry on while im stuck here trying to at least say how im feeling yet getting ignored or overshadowed its like im supposed to just be there for everyone else yet ill be ignored when i need help back the last time i tried to vent out my feelings my friend made it about themselves it feels like im drowning while helping everyone else up and they push me deeper in the water as i get them to the surface ampxb i know at this point none of them would miss me if im gone i dont even know why im alive and i dont know why i help them but i feel selfish not being there for my friends even if they wont help me every night it feels im on the verge of wanting to kill myself and i just look at my phone and wish i could talk to someone yet i just know no one would listen i feel alone,1
is being indecisive a symptom of depression yes in fact trouble making decisions is one of the most common psychological symptoms of depression other depression symptoms such as difficulty concentrating and lack of motivation can make decisionmaking even harder i did not know this as i can be indecisive quiet a bit when i think about it but i only thought to look it up yesterday when i mentioned i was to a friend i can be indecisive due to changing my mind about going for a drink then decided to look up what it really meant and was surprised to see it relates to people who suffer from depression interesting are you someone who suffers from depression and is indecisive,1
cwmentions of ed my grades are average at school i was better than others at languages and took part in olympiads but now that im in uni i just suck at everything you can tell me grades dont mean shit and how some smart and talented people didnt do well in terms of academic performance so what im not one of them by any means im not good at scientific research in my field either they say some people naturally think like scientists they ask the right questions challenge ideas without taking them for granted etc im not capable of that ive had an ed which allowed me to have an extremely low bmi so for some time i felt like im better than others at least at something i was dumb enough to try recovery and now im technically not even underweight i had hobbies like chess and drawing but i dont have enough motivation to do them regularly and anyway it would probably take years for me to become just good at it there are no other areas in my life where i could better than average this is it you could tell me being above average should not be that important anyway its totally fine if its not for others but for me it would mean a lot i would feel like my existence isnt absolutely pointless i cant just live and try to enjoy stuff thanks for reading this,1
my life is alright but im very depressed all the time panic attacks suicidal i feel that nothing in life matters and that life is some weird thing i cant relate to i only live for sex gambling and money however those things dont even bring me happiness i cant do relationships i push people away unintentionally and hurt them emotionally every damn time i wish i could give a fuck about life but i cant why am i still here i suppose this is a rant i just wanted to talk to someone havent really done that in a while im thinking about doing some dumb shit like live more years save every penny then bet on red on roulette if it hits cool ill double down if not who cares ive felt no attachment to anything or anyone recently im applying for a job this week had a job before had some savings i just gambled k ate a steak dinner and burned the rest only had like k there was no turning point in my life where i suddenly didnt care about anything since i was a little kid i can always remember having schizophrenic episodes but was discredited as i was just a dumb kid i would always see shadow people and be irrationally scared of the dark and i would see monsters and just scream and cry silently all the way until i was then i stopped paying attention to it and just realized if i didnt care then it doesnt matter i had a girlfriend once i was with her for a week we fucked once we went for hours i just got up and left at one point never talked to her again hate my family but id do anything for them i hate religion i hate politics i hate material things i hate people i hate consciousness i hate breathing i hate thinking i hate eating i hate sleeping i hate life i can so easily be anything i want in life that it becomes obsolete to try to live life is just creating problems and then finding the solution endlessly refused to take medication because why would i want to feel a way that i dont not going to trick myself into wanting to live thats stupid what is life and why do we exist,1
m ive never been a super social guy ive always been shy chronic lowgrade depression etc and it hasnt been conducive to making friends i had one irl friend who i met at a job four years ago we were hanging out more frequently and getting closer at the start of this year but i found out something so fucked up about him a month and a half ago that i was pretty much forced to completely stop talking to him i had one online friend and i was very close with her for two years she completely moved on from me a few weeks ago and she made it clear to me a few weeks ago that i was useful for a certain time in her life but now im not useful to her anymore so shes moved on with new irl friends who she just recently met after over a year of applying and interviewing i got an office job in november of i was getting a lot of positive feedback wasnt screwing up any tasks etc but i was suddenly fired without a clear reason two weeks ago i dont have enough experience to reliably know if ill be able to get another job in the same field i dont have a job i have literally no one to talk to not even just an acquaintance or cousin i dont talk to anyone from any of the schools i went to no one from any of the jobs ive had and none of my extended family family drama from a decade ago screwed everything up my parents turned into raging alcoholics six years ago so i mostly avoid them i tried making friends at the most recent job i had but i dont think any of them really liked me tbh my family used to have family friends who would visit and we would just do different things together in general but we dont do shit since they became raging alcoholics idek if its possible to recover from this level of isolation theres literally nothing in my life ive went through almost years of life and i somehow dont even have a single acquaintance to show for it not a single person to talk to or who genuinely cares about me,1
as of now im f in the last weeks of my senior year of high school this time last year my junior year i started my first antidepressant prozac that shit made me crazy i hallucinated attempted to crash my car and almost ran away now im on lexapro on a high dosage and i just feel the same as i did without being on antidepressants my dad originally told me that exercise would help but now im playing varsity softball and only feel good while im playing when i stop my contention fades i just feel like im moving throughout life with no purpose my parents keep asking me about college i got into four of the eleven colleges i applied to i dont have good grades and dont have any motivation to fix it im worried i wont be able to graduate and yet my parents still tell me to be more productive and try harder i dont want to waste my parents money and fail out of university if i end up attending i also feel kind of embarrassed and i know i shouldnt to go to community college people have told me that community college students are weird and embarrassing i know thats not true and theres so many benefits of attending community college i think i just need to stop listening to people but its easier said than done i guess,1
honestly ive been faking being ok for a while ive been in some low places but this is in the top three for the lowest points ive had my youngest sibling died by suicide in november of so i do realize the pain suicide causes but damn when you get into that place its neat impossible to get out of i have plenty of things to keep me going like my nieces and nephews i do want to watch them grow up and be a guide for them but i really am struggling with not wanting to exist anymore the antidepressants im on arent working my doctor is very aware they arent given she knows ive had dreams of suicide recently yet my medications just got added on to im just tired i want to give up even though i know i shouldnt,1
its both cathartic and kind of annoying theres really not a tangible reason for it im not upset about any one thing its more just a general feeling of frustration at myself i guess it doesnt help that my stomach was bothering me all night even after i took the medicine that usually helps that i dont know its just annoying,1
background my brother is much younger to me and the youngest of four siblings he has been dealing with depression and ibs since the age of he is also suicidal when it gets worse he is on psychiatric medications we are a very dysfunctional family where my father turns everyones life into hell to the extent possible my mother has severe depression too current situation so after two years of treatment my brother isnt getting any better there are periods when he does fine but then relapses into depression his ibs also gets worse and it bothers him a lot he is in general very introverted and doesnt let anyone know what he is feeling except for occassional aggressive outburst where he is extremely angry and out of control for usual problems like his ibs my father is currently using financial abuse to torture my mother and brother who are financially dependent on him but i am stepping up to help my brother financially and i tried counseling him and assuring him that i will take care of him no matter what but his condition is not improving he said he feels terrible that he is not able to be normal and do normal activities like going to college regularly or making friends etc i told him that everyones normal is different and he should work as per what feels good to him that day he was fine for sometime but again withdrew to his room where he stays in complete darkness the entire time its been days now i have fixed a new psychiatrists appointment for him and he agreed but i want to know what else can i do in this situation i want him to be fine and happy but nothing seems to work and he is so we cant force him to do anything should i just let him take charge of his life and hope for him to get better or is there something more that i can do no one else in our family is bothered or emotionally attached to him so its just me all advice would be helpful thanks,1
this is probably just a carbon copy of many posts on here but my situation is as follows khhv no friends and no good ties to my family my only interests are video games and anime the former of which isnt even fun i just rage all the time and hate myself after playing basically any game generally disliked by many people because of my toxic personality eotl minimum wage retailer where i dont do a good job im too slow at everything i do and cant do more than half days due to being unable to be around other people too much absolutely not interested in picking up any hobbies or learning any skills theres nothing i would even keep the dedication for since i give up everything i do in life tried therapy and it did absolutely nothing i think this is what one would call being done with life but maybe someone has an idea idk,1

ive been falling into a massive pit of dispair i cant take meds for it because it counteracts other diagnosis i have a therapy appointment on monday im skeptical about going to for judgement im terrified of leaving the house and speaking to people just someone looking at me is enough to trigger a panic attack ive even been avoiding my housemates as much as possible i talk to people online but i feel like im going crazy ive tried to stop myself from suicide times in the last two weeks theirs no other help other than this free place i reluctantly arranged to go to im overwhelmed with anxiety and paranoia when people speak to me or look at me or breathe near me i wanna disappear as fast as possible im thinking of wearing a mask and sunglasses to walk to the appointment on monday so no one can recognize me or try to talk to me because people seeing me is my biggest issue i dont understand why but its seriously affecting me i havent left the house in many days barely been able to shower brush my teeth cook and working is just as hard but the only thing ive managed now the level of my paranoia is affecting my work i wish i could just snap out of it i want to clean up and exercise and stuff but i cant get out of bed,1
i have always struggled with depression but things got worse for me once entering and eventually leaving an abusive romantic relationship in high school i have struggled to cope with the abuse i faced i have also struggled with letting people in because of my distrust as my depression increased my friends became uncomfortable around me saying i bring down the vibes they stopped inviting me to things texting me and calling my brother told me that he would cut me off if i continued to live life as i am now i am a sophomore in college and i have lost majority of the people around me because i dont know which is better for others to stay in their lives even tho it hurts them when im around or cut off contact with those around me even if they claim they want me around im barely existing at this point,1

to realise that theres no point in fighting anymore because the hope youve been trying to hang onto doesnt actually exist anymore there must be a point where it is actually okay to give up when youve tried so hard to continue for so many years and nothing has ever changed for the better is it now okay for me to quit now i cant do it anymore the ups the downs and the lower than downs its just not worth it people will understand wont they the train of life arrives at different stations everyday i think this is where i get off,1
i havent felt like any thing in my life has been real since a very difficult thing and year of absolute hell in my life everything moves fast and i only feel seconds of gratification i almost never know whats going on anymore my brain feels like a jumbled mess of thoughts wants needs i dont know who i am anymore because i act out in unpredictable ways ive been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and have been taking my medication but i absolutely feel nothing except immense sadness or pain i cant really make meaningful changes in my behavior because any sort of order makes me uncomfortable and anxious so i return back to this chaotic state things move to quickly and i feel like im swimming within my body this has been going on for years and all my medical health professionals are aware of this and are unsure how to treat it anyone else feel the same way,1
after losing all of my hobbies and interests i also stopped liking all the food i used to love i still eat its not that im not hungry i just dont enjoy eating anymore not even great food and its really weird and depressing does anyone have the same issue,1
hi there do you have any tips how to deal with rumination i know that trying to suppress it is counterproductive ive decided to try to distract myself during the next episodes by playing scrabble on my phone because it needs some thinking while going for a walk or cleaning the shower allows for rumination during the activity thank you very much in advance,1
just came here to write down my feelings i have a fragile mental state and am not good with sharing my feelings with my friends or family i think people would generally describe me as someone with a sense of humour and as having good spirits i am able to joke and laugh tell people i am feeling great but i have a dark side that nobody knows because i dont want to share as i dont want to be a burden usually i am able to keep the feelings away maintain the facade and stay strong and reasonably happy but recently things have not been going well for me and i think what little resilience i had got washed away it is becoming hard for me to stay positive because i feel so numb inside i am becoming less motivated to do things that i enjoyed only a couple weeks ago i dont want to socialise anymore i have work piling up to the point that i am completely overwhelmed but dont feel sharp enough or motivated enough to make a start to it i was drifting between two friend groups and lost one of them because i decided to prioritise the other i feel disconnected from my family and friends mainly because they are currently so far away i have a bad relationship with my father who i feel like does not care for me anymore after he started a new family i hate the way i act and am consumed by guilt and embarrassment when i think about my words or actions a romantic situation i was involved with for only a month imploded and i cant stop blaming myself cant stop thinking about it or fully letting go i have never handled rejection very well and i have thought that maybe the rejection that i received from her is the shock that caused me to crumble i seriously dont know what to do anymore and i do seems to sink me deeper into this hole that i have fallen into unable to see any escape days pass like crazy and i feel as though i am insulated unable to feel anything but numbness i have never sought professional help and as an exchange student far away from home i dont know how available that would be maybe someone can relate to what i am going through and give me some advice if you made it all the way down here thanks for giving me your attention,1

little suicidal poem to express myself since im an anxious depressed wreck questioning if living is worth it if you dont get it its basically im only at peace when slumber is reached im only at peace when sleeping so perhaps if i flee id finally happen to be free if i killed myself maybe id finally be free and be at peace is eternal slumber the key is death the solution to my problems ampxb i dont know if i should elaborate on my problems or not i doubt anyone would care enough to read all of them and in the end getting told that someone is sorry for what happened to me doesnt really do much i appreciate the words none the less but i dont think anything will ever make me feel better ive gotten into this hole of depression and anxiety over and over and over it never stops itll never leave me alone not unless im asleep or dead,1

my parents play such a victim mentality and never own up to their mistakes after all the shitty things they had done they not once recognized it and simply defended themselves by saying they thought it was for the better they always have thought like this what about me the impact it made on me and how badly it fucked me up theres a huge difference in intent and outcome you cannot justify your shitty behaviors because of your good intent,1
its simple i dont enjoy life so i need to search for a reason to continue living while other people simply enjoy their existence even if there are plenty of bad things happening to them,1
hey been a while since i posted something here im years old and from brazil been having some great moments on my life overall with some amazing moments and alot of development from therapy but even with minor problems the real one is that im probably an undiagnosed autistic guy and even if its a low to moderate level it makes me go nuts this really seems like a he of a problem daily and yet i somehow manage to survive without ripping my ears off hate how anoying this is to the point i hate using the microwave and always add an extra second just to not hear it beeping how any sound looks like a jumpscare from a horror movie most of the time and on top of all this always happened to me on my childhood and yet no one even bothered to listen my side calling me either a crybaby that i was faking it got called alot for having no social life and yet no one seemed to care when i asked help or either seemed like they were forced to do it dunno if its autism since some people say anyone can have alot of symptons that are inside the spectre yet arent considered but the good thing is that i atleast got a way to sleep better without having any noise waking me up with the new medication sorry if it was long this seemed the place where i could talk about anything envolving my personal hell,1
i have chronic brain fogg and fatigue and also depression sometimes when i have no brain fog or fatigue i also have no depression,1
so i literally dont talk to anyone anymore super depressed going about my days i would be dead such a long time ago if it wasnt for the weirdest most pathetic thing ever the first person and basically only time ive been truly in love i doubt well ever hang out again let alone end up together but i love her so much still so many years later that even that chance of feeling us hold each other is just enough to get through another day im now and its been over ten years since ive had that feeling and experience but out of all my ups and downs and insane experiences traumatic shit everything she gives me the feeling i need to just get through things days sometimes down to the minutes and seconds her life is normal and fulfilling and pretty nice if you ask me i doubt she thinks of me and im not a strung out piece of shit like i was years back anymore but no matter how normal my life looks now a days its so empty and its always felt empty without the feeling she gave me so long ago i feel like such a pathetic loser for holding onto this love for so long without reciprocation without telling her and with it having been the only reason ive ever got through how terrible i had my life in the past ill probably die with that secret someday too but i just wanted to put it somewhere out into the universe even if its just here on reddit that ive had this feeling ive held onto that ive embedded into the fiber of my being so that i take it everywhere ill ever go and its the why to every breath i unconsciously take i dont expect this to mean anything to any of you but theres love in the world that no darkness can bring down no drug could compare no words can describe and no time can erase and i hope that you find it and if youve had it and lost it as i have may you live with that small hope you feel when you reminisce,1
i woke up crying hours ago and havent stopped the pressure in my chest is continuously building up i want to disappear,1
im yo and im tired of what im studying computer science i dont find it interesting that much i find it stressful and the job market is extremely competitive there is just so much fcking information to learn in cs its absolutely crazy when people say that you always have to learn in this field they werent joking most of the material i will just forget quickly after a semester luckily i am in community college so i havent spent really any money on this degree but i have spent a shit ton of time on it tho despite all that time spent already i feel like it wont help me that much if i dont start to seriously study more but i just cant bring myself to i dont really know what i want to do with my life but i do kinda like my job in retail even though for many people it seems like a shitty job and it kinda is but at least its an easy job without too much stress tbh night shifts are the best because there are no managers so i sometimes just chill after finishing my tasks for like an hour i can even come in high and do my job easily but there really is a social pressure to do something better with your life and i get it i really kinda dont want to do this forever but at the same time even if i somehow get a job in my field i feel like this field would just be too stressful for me i have thought of other options than retail that dont require a degree but i just cant try getting into them because i have to finish this degree first since i only have a bit left before finishing,1
long story short for a better understanding i harmed my body and soul so many times because of untreaded trauma i think i drink booze on the weekends since my th birthday and later some party drugs came in if i would have a glimpse of which pain i will live through back in the days i would have never touched any drug i had so many breakdowns in the last years and it feels like i will never be the person again i was with the booze and the drugs came panic attacks and anxiety disorders i am not the same anymore and dont know if this ever will pass i feel miserable no energy cant laugh anymore its like being buried alive how did some of you guys survived this and are your cognitive functions and general well being better i just try with all in my power to get healthy mentally and body im thankful for every help out there thank you for taking time to read my story,1
httpswwwanxietycentrecomarticlesletdowneffectanxietyafterstress i found this article today and i feel like it describes exactly whats happening for me but for me ive been experiencing anxiety and depression im and have a long long history of mental health issues generally speaking theyve improved over the past years with lots of ups and downs since december life has been highly stressful death in the family health issues housing issues work school you name it i had so much adrenaline pumping through me for months the past weeks everything has settled i found stable housing moved in with my partner and the relationship is great school is done my dad is supporting me financially everything is suddenly great except the past week my mood has dropped fast intense anxiety crying at work the worst part is im supposed to be feeling happy theres nothing that can explain the feelings so this let down effect is my best guess anyone else experienced this im praying time will start to relieve some of these horrible feelings,1

i have been struggling with anxiety and depression for a long time now and eating disorders in the past that have not fully healed the trigger this time was that i saw a photo my broyfriend took of me and my legs appeared enormous to me that single thought that arised from a photo that a loved one took on me lead to not eating in three days selfinjuries and an endless loop of feeling like shit i feel so narcissistic and chidlish why would my looks be at all this important still now i cannot get over it just seeing my legs in a photo that was taken with love my boyfriend almost threw me out of home cos i was behaving like a fucking idiotic child yet it is so hard to get out of the loop i literally have nothing that makes me feel happy and i consider myself to be under the normal for intelligence and i dont have any special skills so i dont see a point in feeling better with myself i feel so miserable so useless i only bring dark stuff to my lovely boyfriend its like i know how to get out of the loop my therapist gave me many tips but still when i am in the middle i cannot get out my mind is racing with destructive shit that i believe and i act according to all these thoughts the eating disorder has already been on for years and i am already i never imagined at this point of my life i would still be dealing my so many instrusive thoughts and still thinkking this is such a big of an issue its like really who is going to notice i put on weight and if they do why would it be so importnat there are far many things more importnat than looks but i seem to not be able to get over it anyhow i feel like i should really die if am not skinny this post might be destructured as i am a little anxious right now tldr i am and still behaving like a baby and thinking my body image issues are the center of the world i am ruining my relationship because when i get in a depressive mood i cannot get out of it during days and i become aggressive and a total bitch with everyone i dont want to live like this i want to enjoy my loved ones,1
the pandemic ruined my mental health i cant get out of bed and i cant sleep at night i feel so unloved i hate my life so much but im such a coward i just want to be dead i hate myself so much this is the worst its ever been and its only getting worse my meds arent working group therapy has never helped the hospital made me worse my mom and stepdad lost my trust by screaming at me im so lonely i have no one around me my friends never fucking reach out its always me im getting sick and tired of waking up part of me wants to get better because i feel so awful but im in a cycle and i have lost all motivation i just wish something would kill me so i dont have to go through doing it myself im just so afraid ill be put in some other program that wont help me that i hardly ever tell what im feeling i had so much potential i had straight as i wanted to work and go to college my grades have lowered ive stopped going to school and instead i cyber and just cheat on all my courses because its easier than focusing i got out of bed i didnt nap all day i was in therapy but i was getting better and only had episodes around once a year they happen a few times a month nothing helps im broken i just shouldnt be alive my arms are so scared up i have big red ones and they are so embarrassing ive hardly seen anyone with ones like mine i just cant stop cutting i thought seeking an autism diagnosis would help but since ive been diagnosed its been worse my mom immediately said i was using it as an excuse my mom and stepdad never ever tried to adapt to my sensory issues or even read about how they could help me they just expect me to do all the work and all they do is find programs to put me in or dictate my appointments every time ive discussed something i didnt like that they do they have never tried to stop they only listen in therapy there is no point to being alive if climate change is going to kill us all anyway nothing anyone says will ever make me feel better im doomed,1
im trying to pick myself up,1
ive had severe social anxiety since i was this has led me to live nearly years with little social interaction which has made me pretty miserable i cant believe ive lived this long feeling unfulfilled and generally dissatisfied with my life like damn im gonna be and i have very little life experience ive spent many weekends fishing w my father because i didnt have anything else to do bc i have no friendsand its like even tho i love fishing it just starts feeling like im always missing something i need regardless of what im doing im missing friends and social interaction i moved out of my parents house and in w my grandparents to work over here and im at a very low point every day is painful if im at work i fucking hate it being at home is ok but still im lonely and depressed and having nothing to do brings my loneliness to center stage ive though about suicide a lot it feels good to imagine the pain ceasing i cant stand to watch myself get older and each year im still the same no friends and generally miserable im just so done with life,1
i feel like im extremely mediocre at best and utterly hopeless at worst in virtually everything i set out to do why i still exist or attempt to bother at all i have no idea i wish for just one day i could have some marketable talent so that the right people would actually notice and support me so that id be able to do what i want to do it might happen but in the words of wayne campbell from waynes world monkeys might fly out of my butt fuck it lets face it im completely without skills looks or brain power required to achieve the skills i desire,1
internet stalking was a bad idea,1
to be honest im not expecting much ive seen therapists onoff over the years and its always fine but never enough this one is through my eap at work and the limited text exchange that ive had with him give me pretty lukewarm vibes no red flags just not that engaged although i suppose thats normal since weve never met i dont even know what to want anymore i cant figure out what makes me happy longterm and i think im wired to be anxious and depressed i dont want to die and i definitely wont for a while too many bucketlist items to do but i just have this feeling that things wont end well when do we get to a point where were just happy relaxed loved and have what we want i have become traumatized jaded and a shell of my former self,1
i need advice for selfharm impulses ive been selfinflicting head trama recently i caused my eye to bleed and had a seizure sacrificed a lot of relationships for the love of my life and she left me and is working with my brother and its really suspicious she lives with my mom i feel extremely abandoned and i worry about braindamage i constantly find myself hitting myself in the head and face,1
hello im in my fourth year of college and after the semester i only have one left but for like the past year ive been slowly losing interest in school and in the career i wanted to go into it is hard for me to stay focused in class and find the motivation to do the assignments in school work i am going into user interface design but i feel like i would be good in the field for some years i had trouble with the pression but a couple years ago i had a girlfriend for a year and that made me happy but once we broke up ive kind of slowly went back to the depression i had before feeling that load you know i am i just feels like im not really had trouble finding amotivation to do what i wanted to do any advice,1
i am miserable i dont enjoy living i dont enjoy being me and i dont enjoy waking up knowing im in fucking ground hogs day i dont care about relationships ive never had a crush i dont like talking to people the closer i get to someone the more i want to run away from them all of my conversations are surface level just the bare minimum to reach whats socially acceptable i dont have any hopes or dreams for the future i dont have any hobbies i dont have any passions or interests i dont feel excited i dont feel joy doing anything other than sleeping ive planned for suicide on three different occasions the first time i was stopped before i could carry it out the other two i failed and wound up in the hospital each time i said okay ill go get help maybe things will improve maybe things will get better they dont how many times am i going to do this how many times and i going to repeat this hoping itll be different long term depression and anxiety has left me a hollow husk of a living being im either crumbling under anxiety completely apathetic or about to snap from irritability everyday is the same nightmare i just dont think this is worth the struggle,1
f last year had been so weird i graduated fucked a relationship up didnt cheat but the ex couldnt take that i slept with someone else he was broken so i spiraled guilty anxious lonely also i was preparing for a big test i cared a lot i used to be worried cried all day then snap i feel nothing im sleeping all day when i go towards the books im like why im so numb psychiatrist diagnosed me with atypical depression and gave me pills which im not allowed to take coz mom says there will be side effects today i was allowed to ride a bike i hit a car and fell down it was a minor accident but bro i realized i felt nothing after that nothing at all this couldnt have been me i was a girl who was afraid to ride bikes i used to freak out so much now i just dont care not even the fact that im able to ride the bike if it was the earlier me id feel goosebumps with a sense of achievement id feel fear anxious and scared about the accident whats wrong with me i feel as though im an empty floating balloon,1
i feel as though all my life i have been becoming unlovable i can see myself decay the things i enjoyed are meaningless and because i exist and interact with others i take a part of the joy away from them too i do not want to live but i dont want to hurt the few people that might get affected by it i feel guilty to a point where i wish i get terminally ill and succumb i feel guilty for taking up space and being here,1
fear and anxiety rule his every thought loneliness and despair fill every breath in his lungs darkness reigns unchallenged the light is all gone feelings of happiness extinguished and drowned deluge of pain and suffering watered them down like an ancient warrior facing certain death wounded bruised and bleeding he marches on flashes of memories that are long gone hints of an era that once had begun with fire and passion his heart once fought stabbed and damaged it wont pump blood only anger rage flow thru the holes for his queen he swore once that death he would take just to protect her from the evils out there but no one had warned him of the evil within a festering wound that ends in gangrene rotting soul and heart but not too fast ensuring he suffers as much as he can the dream of a life was just a mirage leading the warrior into an inescapable trap battle after battle war after war trenches of anguish is where he stands what was the purpose the man thought to himself looking around for someone to help no one in sight to hear his plight only more darkness and none of the light hopeless and tired he kneels on his sword with honor and valor he lets it all go plunging the steel makes the flesh cold followed by warmth of the pouring hot blood seconds feel like years as life flashes by he enjoys every memory with his last ever smile but out of the darkness someone reached out returning the light and the life that ran out the warrior perplexed looked almost scared for he had never encountered no one that cared his story unfinished and with no clear path but now hes determined to let go of the past wounds that are healing wounds that will come master the pain that will never be gone no matter how close or how far he will continue to battle this war,1
im and i am a former shell of who i was at like i have no goals or ambitions anymore i used to be ambitious im trying to improve like i am volunteering but i still dont have confidence or anything,1
im and turning in may i have tried living a normal life with a full time job but that doesnt help ive also tried therapy and have been taking mg of sertraline for about a year and a half now and that barely helps me i want to pass away but i have anxiety so im afraid of the pain that might come with it im stuck in what seems like and endless circle of hating life but being terrified to end it i need help,1
even my girlfriend who im thankful to have in my life i feel alone nothing has changed i dont know what the answer is ive been wondering that for years im and theres no signs of it getting better only various forms of coping mechanisms my dad will probably pass away soon and then im stuck with my brother who i dont get on with its so exhausting trying to stumble through life and pretending youre ok when youre really not even if you tell someone youre not ok it just becomes awkward and they will treat you differently and not in a positive way so you make out youre fine and put on a brave face despite how empty you feel on the inside i honestly dont know if theres anything left for me when my dad goes people say you have so much to live for really like what most people end up being garbage whether thats in real life or online theres too much stress dealing with literally everything and theres little substance everything feels fake its all so draining im so fucking tired at this point,1
im tired,1
i have been depressed since i was at least i am now thats more than of my life i can be okay in brief glimpses am doing therapy have found its hard cause i didnt have treatment for so long so i am really battling deep routed stuff that i learned in childhood should i expect that i can get better or should i should just sort of accept that itll probably never get better,1
my exboyfriend recently decided to call it quits on our one and half year relationship due to family circumstances hes been going through a lot dealing with his parents not taking it well that he is gay and had a male partner dealing with some recent news that his beloved grandma in china is dying of cancer and doesnt have much longer to live hurting from not being able to see his grandma and be able to spend her last weeksmonths with her because of visa issues dealing with a potential looming layoff at his company that could impact his ability to stay in the us he went back on prozac a few weeks ago to cope with everything and the resulting depression im hurt that he broke things off but i understand that the relationship is the least of his priorities given the circumstances i still want to be there for him as a friend what can i do to support him through this difficult time,1
that feeling of going home after hanging out with friends after you get home its relieving that you dont have to smile anymore or be happy for that matter its like hot and cold its so nice to see the people you love but then go home and just lay and wither away,1
i just dont understand why my brain is like this i want to be happy i think i do at least i just ive never experienced happiness in any normal way i havent eaten in lets see about days oh its am so yeah days ive got snacks protein powder easy meals whatever i just dont have any appetite anymore i dont have the willpower to force myself to do anything now let alone feed myself i mean ive literally made awesome dinners for my family so many times just to not eat any myself and i have always had these moments of pure self hatred where i dont feel anything aside from depression honestly for as long as i can remember i was born like this and its progressively been happening more and more often and it tends to get more severe each time now i have reached a point where the depression doesnt even bother me anymore i dont have the urge to fight off the negativity it all feels normal like im meant to feel this way regardless of what i do my anxiety often fights off the urges to di fear of nothing happening after death the question of is it better to be alive and suffer or die and be nothing you know the usual however in these moments in this moment i suppose i am completely zombified i just lay in my bed trying my best to sleep my problems and my life away as much as possible though im usually awake for hoursall night on my phone trying to distract myself from the demons in my brain i just really let myself diminish into a pit of self hatred and past mistakes im covered by state insurance and i have seen professionals im aware of my mental issues and im medicated on paroxetine mg and lamotrigine mg but the process is never as simple as call and make an appointment its hard to work up the strength to care enough to call and then when you get busy uncoordinated state covered mental health facilities on top of it well im sure a lot of you can relate so usually even when i try my best i am unable to get professional help for my issues because i am way too broke to afford anything thats not covered by my insurance and on top of that we moved states and insurance recently so here i am i guess i dont really have a goal here or like a question or anything sorry i just want to vent to strangers maybe some will relate and this might just be enough for them to view things in their own life differently,1
so this is maybe the wrong kind of question but has anyone here gone on zoloft and just started feeling like doing nothing but sleep ive been on it for probably weeks now and its becoming more of a problem the last two days especially ive barely felt like being awake at all i have an appointment friday but not with my prescriber so ill bring it up but i wondered if anyone else has had this happen and if it improves with more time or whether it might be that i need to have my medication switched,1
i get so scared at night and not even of normal stuff like i feel like a normal person would be scared of an intruder or a spider or something i get scared like what if the portal to hell is outside my door or what if the sky changes color all of a sudden or what if i go to the bathroom and everything is upside down is this normal if not what does it mean,1
i think my everything failed when i kept giving up on killing myself i kept trying and trying to make him even fucking care when all he wanted was sex all he wanted from me was some fuck hole as id lay there and let him do what he wants and id sit and cry when id get home wondering if i should have let anything continue if i should have let him do this to me as he continues to use me for shit i hope he actually kills himself before me so i can go spit on his grave and cry at the same time because he is all i have left and he ignores me and complains that i fuck up so much and how i cant do anything right and i cant do anything if i leave him hes gonna attack me and most likely ruin my life even if its already fucked hes like a fucking man child he can bitch at me and treat me like shit but when it comes to me even slightly being upset because of his actions im the fucking bad guy im the piece of shithe is why i want to kill my self he is why i dont want to find anyone to help me because he will get mad its not him he will get pissed that i didnt tell him i was going to kill myself while he has told me he wouldnt care that i would die that i should do it and i will this week once i get the courage i need to say goodbye and not feel like shit as i die im tired and sick of trying so fucking hard for him to treat me like garbage i know i fucked up before i did a lot of bad things in this relationship but i apologized i changed and i became new and now it hurts now im hurting myself when i said i wouldnt now im shoving a pistol in my mouth with one bullet so he cant hurt himself when i do it even in the middle of dying im thinking of him im thinking of how much i truly love and care even when hes done this to me im still wondering if ill actually do it or after i actually end up pregnant or maybe during pregnancy i want to hurt him as he hurt mei want to leave an impact on him when i die i want to make him hurt but i dont at the same time on a alt account so if i dont see im sorry,1

ive f been going through the most stressful depressive episode ive ever been in and i can hardly get anything done at best i get maybe hours of work done in the afternoon before i have an anxietystressdepression attack and my body decides to just shut down literally its hard for me to move and id collapse if i try to stand i cant keep my eyes open and it wears me out to the point that afterwards i just lay there and try to do something low energy like reading until i get up to make sure i at least eat something and spend some time with my parents i can usually spend a bit more time on work if im feeling particularly good or hobbies like music and art if i dont have another attack at night but im also only productive for maybe hours before i switch to something low energy again really my low energy activity is mostly just reading fiction sometimes ill try to play video games but thats rare nowadays my therapist knows all of this and were working on it still gotta handle it in the meantime though im not employed right now but i do remote volunteer work that takes probably hours a week i can get my work done but i feel like im seriously hanging by a thread im also job searching but to be honest i have no idea how ill hold down a full time job im not sure i can even really hold down a remote part time job truthfully ive considered at least taking small freelance gigs but its difficult to get going i feel like im making a lot of excuses since i use to autopilot pretty well through high school and college but with the intense physical symptoms i have now i feel like my depression is more debilitating than ever im kind of scared that soon i wont be able to manage anything and ill let my life slip by tldr i probably avg hours of productivity work and hobbies a day autopilot isnt working since i have physical symptoms that make it hard to move and leave me dead tired i feel like im making excuses and my depression feels inscreasingly debilitating just wondering how you guys manage to get things done or if theres others that may be going through the same struggle,1
i am years old and a university student in south korea when i was in high school i was betrayed by friends who i really trusted i experienced that one of my closest friends got bullied and quit school i was so afraid and i tried to befriend students in other classrooms therefore they were my best friends during the field trip they said that they disliked me and asked me to leave i was so shocked i tried to talk with the teacher but it was meaningless after that i was alone and i spent days in fear a week later i was diagnosed with severe depression i really had tough times as i tried to commit suicide i was hospitalized for months i believed that the only way to change this situation is going to university i studied hard and others said my achievement is a miracle however my time stopped in high school my heart and the way how to treat others are the same as a high school student like the days i spent the whole night crying i am good at making good relationships with professors i treat them politely and as people who i have to learn meanwhile i am not good with friends because i am so afraid and dont know how to make a good relationship have you seen the glory they said victims were abandoned at times they suffered i totally understand what they meant fortunately my medication is almost over the psychiatrist will not prescribe antidepressants soon thats what i dreamed and wished for however i am so afraid because i am cured doesnt mean my past is recovered i just tell my story of depression and concern i didnt have any purpose for you but i just wanted to tell it,1

he has done everything for me he has taught me everything physical and emotional stuff he dropped his dreams of working as an engineer just so he can help my moms small business and watch over me easily he used to smoke but quit right before i was born he used to be in a gang in vietnam but dropped all of that just to go to the us and start a family he tells of how gangs of kids in their school would jump the fence and literally start fighting and shoot at each other with marbles using slingshots he tells me stories of his childhood and how at one point at my age he fought off guys and defended his mom by throwing his bike at them he is very easygoing and understanding street smart he literally cooks for me every night even though i already know to cook for myself and every weekend we go camping fishing or etc but so far in my life he has been my only friend and it feels like i failed him im a nobody im not smart or attractive im not an ivy student im mediocre with no ambition and going to community college how can my father have this exciting life and look at me in the eye and still say hes proud of me and loves me how can he look at a kid who has never once been complimented by a stranger and call him handsome or how can he call a kid who never got a or any academic award smart why does my father love me so much it wouldve been so much easier to just end it all but he has to love me and make me stay as im writing this ive been crying so much i was so numb for months but suddenly during my th birthday and this post its all pouring out its pathetic i would never want him to see me like this im a disgrace who will end the bloodline of smart and attractive doctors soldiers and farmers no girl will want a guy who is this connected to his father is there such a thing as a dadas boy goes to show how pathetic and unintelligent i am when this is one of the few things i pour my heart into and it turns out like some middle schooler wrote it,1
a guy in the tail end of high school liked a girl who was his classmate so much but did not ask her out because they were friends also the guy had low selfesteem after they were close and sometimes flirted but nothing serious they continued to be friends through college even though she studied out of town every time she goes back home they hang out during college the guy majors in chemistry and during the third year he got depressed and caved into pressure and had a panic attack due to not catching up in school and the idea that he is a failure to his parents that resulted in him not going to school anymore he did this in secret throughout the semester so when the next semester is up his parents discovered that he stopped going to school and instead wandered around town and wasted time in lan cafes during this incident he cut off all communication with his friends and acquaintances he was lonely during this time after his family discovered the incident his family already saw him as a failure and it was clear from their eyes and the way they treated him this got him more depressed and ashamed at some point he realized he had lost the motivation to do anything productive he did not know when it started so he pondered and remembered when he was last motivated and realized that it was only because of his friends back then then he thought back to his childhood and realized he would rather not try to do anything because if he made a mistake he would be punished and if he did good then nothing maybe he was not motivated at all because he was raised in a negative punishment methodology of parenthood he blamed his parents for the things that he was but he also realized that his parents did everything to provide for his needs except for the needs of warmth and recognition he was conflicted his parents asked him to go to school after the school year ended and he accepted as he was ashamed of what he did he studied in another town during his studies he realized that he could not make any meaningful connection with anyone at all he realized again he was lonely during this second chance of studying he heard news about the girl he liked and he felt things when it was good news he was happy when it was bad news he was concerned one of the guys high school friends fathers died and he saw her again it was weird he realized he loved her and he now only loves the idea of her a type of obsession of pain as every future that the guy saw was with her but she is now in a happy relationship and the guy she is in a relationship with is great and the guy thinks that they would be married and the guy also thinks its good for them to be married after graduation the guy returned to his hometown but remained unemployed he felt lost and uncertain of what to do next he often thought of his past mistakes and regrets including not pursuing the girl he had feelings for and not taking his studies seriously as time passed he became more and more discouraged he didnt have the motivation to pursue any opportunities that came his way even those that could have helped him grow and develop his skills he spent most of his days alone feeling like he was stuck in a neverending cycle of hopelessness and despair despite the encouragement of his friends and family he continued to feel like a failure he couldnt shake the feeling that he had let everyone down including himself he knew that he needed to make a change but he didnt know where to start the future was uncertain and he didnt know what would happen next but he knew that he couldnt give up even when things seemed impossible he would continue to search for a way out of his current situation hoping that one day he could find his way back to a brighter future,1

im quite depressed and have been for a long time now i thought this show really showed the difference between someone who just wants a break from it all and someone who has nothing left in their lives i dont think ive seen a better representation of depression in television,1
i have struggled with depression for as long as i can remember even when i was young i wasnt really happy anyway i was diagnosed in my early twenties i have learned how to live with depression how to alleviate it etc i havent really been to therapy a lot for several reasons lately i dont have the energy for most things i can barely make it through the day i have deadlines and things to do and i really really want to get out of this vicious cycle and get better but every now and then i completely lose hope i dont really want to die because despite everything i maintain my optimism that things can and will change but in the meantime how am i supposed to function to get there change only happens with actions i dont have the energy ive lost all motivation my main problem these days is whats the point i see whats going on in the world and everything is going to shit people are fake as fuck the only things that matter to society are extremely superficial i dont understand how people function in this society its probably also helpful to mention that my home life is an epic disaster i had to move in with my parents because i dont work currently thank you depression and for the past year and a half they have been in a preseparation mode that they wont conclude i think that both of them are narcissists who ultimately only care about themselves my mom holds me responsible for her marriage and she has played the victim her whole life my dad is a narcissistic liar who wont deal with the truth my siblings are pretty toxic and i am the one that they all depend on for emotional support the thing no one is really there for me anyway this was a rant i needed to let out because i dont really have anyone to vent to i dont want to burden my boyfriend with my depression he doesnt deal well with it i dont want to tell my friend about this because they have their own problems and we barely ever get to talk they all live abroad i rarely meet people who understand me can anyone relate to my story,1

a few of my friends randomly called me out today for always putting myself down and always being sadcrying for no reason and told me how annoying it is they also called out a few other disorders i deal with i told them i suffer with depression which they know and im seeing a professional to help me with it yet they still said it making me feel x worse i even apologised to thembut they picked apart my apology and created more problems so at this point i dont feel like trying anymore i understand that dealing with depressed people can be a lot for some but most of the time i stay quiet when im sad theyre the same ones who always preach how mental health matters on instagram but in reality they act like this im not sure what to do i dont have any other friends and some of my friends in that friend group are great but those few friends hurt my feelings so bad do i just pretend to be happy around them today i kept crying at school because of what they said to me and i fear tomorrow will be much worse i hate attending school in the first place but this makes it so much worse,1
this is my first time posting here i just feel super hopeless with nothing to look forward to but nothing is wrong i have a good job and a beautiful son i have a boyfriend im not having money trouble but for some reason i just feel horrible i cant stop crying i dont want to do anything i hate feeling like this i wish i was normal i just feel like a burden to be around i dont know how to make this stop,1
i have been living with suicide thoughts since i was yo and and ive been tried to kill myself at least times i really cant remember when i was ok but at the same time its been at least years since i tried to kill myself so i think theres an improvement but now i just feel tired of trying tired of existing my hair is a mess my bedroom is in a terrible condition and i have to force myself to eat i cant find something that excites me its just like if i was alone all the time but at the same time surrounded by people that cant comprehend this feeling is it cause i dont have friends my social anxiety got worse over time as i met new people they just treated me like a clown it was as if i were their entertainment even sending a message online makes my heart run like crazy once someone harassed me when entering a chat for kpop stans it was a traumatic experience so i decided to go as incognito as i could and then i cant get treatment for this why dont i go to a psychologist you may ask well theres a member of my family that is a psychologist and shes really a manipulative and an hypocrite b so my parents dont let me see one i know they are worried but i need help,1
i dont even know where to start i really dont i barely even know how to describe how im feeling but when i say i have never felt this broken completely lonely and depressed i mean it i truly just need someone to talk too vent and just let everything out because i just dont know what to do anymore and i honestly dont know what to do,1
i dont know if this makes sense but this mental dancing on the line of being just okay and extremely not okay has taken an extreme toll on me lately it seems every time something or someone chips away at me it robs me my opportunity to make that part of me better im so sad i dont have any real parents almost no real family my dog is genuinely the only thing that brings happiness constantly if only it wouldnt break this poor dogs heart for me too be gone if i could just make her forget i was here i could be at peace with myself the inner turmoil has become so great not entirely sure how much longer i can mingle on the line of okay and very not okay the bad may outweigh the good in my reality my reality isnt everyones hopefully they will understand that signed pain,1
i live relatively a good life compared to most people have a nice girlfriend family money but i dont see the purpose of living i have been going to therapy recently they told me to hang on the small purposes i have now but i think its not enough what if my girlfriend leaves me what if i get bored of my current hobbies i dont have a strong sense of purpose i cannot just hang on to the temporary small things,1
im not in the best of state mentally sitting around doing school or on the phone pretty much spending my life in my room my biggest problem in life is no motivation i have a lot of trouble getting my school done sometimes i get so far behind that thing start to go crazy drawing off point here so i get these bizarre periods of depression lasting from to hours one time it lasted for days and when i get like this i dont eat sleep or talk to anyone i get these strong urges to end my life convincing myself that its the right thing to do calling myself a coward if i somehow failed in the past but the truth is im scared im scared that one day it will get so bad that ill actually kill myself i try to find ways to slap myself out of my depressed states calm myself down and try to relax maybe go outside for a walk my parents and siblings really dont take mental illnesses seriously and i have no way of seeing a therapist i really dont know what to do i dont want to die but i lose my common sense when im depressed is there some way around it or maybe a way of convincing my family that its a problem is it to much to ask for help,1
when do you no longer feel tired not sleepy just tired,1
i have a few friends who i dont hang out with too much but i still usually feel like i have no one to talk to and this has been eating at me for quite some time now im trying to work on meeting new people and i think id want to be in a relationship soon but im pretty awkward in general so its hard for me to actually talk to people i honestly think i might maybe be less depressed if i just knew someone i could talk to i guess,1
i often find myself as of recent feeling like mr krabs without his shell,1
when i was younger my life was in danger cuz of hard illness after my long recovery my mom died to cancer i know this isnt propably my fault by still all life i blame myself i am alive but my mom isnt and i blade myself for i dont wanna my life and i am not happy in it but i cant give it to my mom so si can enoy more being alive i hate myself but wanna become anybody in life to make mom ghostno i dont hear or see her proud but all my short life i suck in everything and i dont see any future for me,1
im fully grown have a degree gainfully employed the only people im close with anymore is my parents my siblings have children so my parents wont be alone i think my parents would be the only people really deeply hurt if i left which sort of makes it the right time to go i guess im just wondering if anyone has any advice on how to ease the loss for people close to them i wish i could have their blessing but i dont think it would be right to involve them in my decision,1
i have no idea how to continue im fed up beyond belief and feel i have nowhere to turn i feel like i cant continue anymore,1
im am a year male im tall and lanky when i was alot younger maybe around i use to like wear shorts until some kids started judging on how skinny i was then i started feeling some type of way fast forward a couple years me and my cousin and older brother was in walmart my cousin decided open a bag of chips and leave them the employee noticed so she came over to us she didnt see our faces but she knew boys did it so she immediately blamed me and i asked my cousin why he said maybe bc your ugly i dont hate him for that or anything bc i used to get bullied when i about my body type and my face so it kinda made sense fast forward to covid happened worst thing that ever happened to me i lost all my friends social skills everything i was a people pleaser in school so i literally didnt know who i was i went through a intense sadness still am kinda because even my own friends used to called me ugly but i just brush it off but i started thinking about since i had a lot more free time the shit literally ruined me for like a year i used to hope to die in my sleep but after a year i gained the courage to talk to some girls went terrible they said how you looks i sent a photo and they replies was always oh or just block me that shit ruined me even more to the i occasionally try to yk since i was lonely and didnt have nobody to the deed with i got addicted its sometimes so bad i get extremely upset that i couldnt watch it or find a good video it made my social skills even worse i couldnt even look at a girl and not thinking about having sex im days free off of it now ik this probably wont make since its short this is just my childhood trauma affecting me and going through a mid life crises i wish the best for anyone thats fighting depression also and know your not alone,1
i dont know how many times ive fantasized a relationship knowing it will never happen yet each time i do it it makes me angry that i believe such a thing could happen i hate that im aware that im making a fool out of myself yet again i still choose to believe i cant ever stop thinking about this it is the only topic ever on my mind i hate seeing happy couples i hate seeing people happy in general i hate seeing people have fun while i spiral down into my own mental ruin whenever i get a opportunity to talk about my problems i never do it matter of fact i dont take opportunities to anything i have only a couple real friends besides the people who are just horrible to me no matter what i do ill always be judged im tired of being treated like an outcast for no reason what the fuck did i do for you to hate me there is no actual reason people are just fucking toxic im tired of sitting here pretending that everythings okay im tired of hoping that things could change i dont need therapy i dont need any medication i dont need hope i dont need motivation i need to die what am i saying tomorrow will be betterright,1
ive spent the last four years of my life telling myself that if i work hard and get into a good school with good people things will get better well college decisions rolled out this fridaysunday and i only got into safety schools that i wasnt at all planning on attending i feel absolutely crushed i dont understand it and ive been trying my hardest despite ongoing mental health issues the worst part is watching everyone around me get accepted ive got a gpa and plenty of ap classes but left and right everyone i know is getting accepted into schools with half the acceptance rates of the ones i applied to i dont even know what to do anymore the thought of waiting a year and stomaching a whole other application process makes me want to scream ive been hinging all of my hope for the past four years on this and its all gone,1
i know this is common but damn im hungry and just dont care any tips on dealing with this other than forcing myself to eat,1
greetings i am new to this sub and relatively new to reddit let me give you some background on why im posting here i ran across a post about a month ago from a young teenager about being depressed and all that you know the typical teenage woes out of kindness i replied with some words of comfort and after a while we started messaging and have kept in touch since i am by no means an expert outside of my personal experience dealing with depression and anxiety most of my adult life but all signs point to him having some sort of mental health issues like everyone he has had good days and bad days but lately things have taken a darker turn and im realizing im in over my head for a while our conversations never involved suicide and i know im not really equipped to help people struggling with those thoughts but now its come up a few times and im starting to feel like i could be in danger of inadvertently saying the wrong thing or somehow making the situation worse my first inclination was to steer him in the direction of talking to parents or another trusted adult getting therapy etc but for several reasons thats not an option right now at this point im completely committed to helping this kid get the help he needs and i wont abandon him just because this situation has become more complicated than i originally anticipated i started myself down this road and i wont give up until i know hes safe or at least in the right hands i dont want to get into any details in this post but i could really use some advice from anyone who understands how to talk to a very depressed suicidal kid who probably has mental health issues and is desperately searching for a reason to keep living,1
title,1

did anyone else have very few hobbies or interests growing up im m and for the past years i havent gotten into any hobbies or interesting things i have a hard time relating to people because i dont have anything to talk about it feels like i dont have a personality my whole life has been dedicated to pleasing others doing what i think they want me to do saying what i think they want me to say im struggling with having interests because i honestly dont even know what i like because of this i dont really have any longterm goals for my career hobbies personal growth etc i just want to be a normal functioning member of society but im struggling to find an identity i end up laying in bed all day working towards nothing because im too scared to even try anyways those are my thoughts hopefully some of you can relate,1
dont really know how to explain this further throughout my life ive been tortured with medical issues and a dysfunctional family and so on and so fourth this made me able to resist depression if that makes sense i could essentially ignore it i could force the happiness through and suppress anything else little things have made me happier than normal over the last five months including someone i thought was my friend until it became obvious that likely isnt the case before this i had entire fantastical and delusional ideas about what the next few months could look like between us things are getting worse between my family too and now im dealing with a shitton more responsibilities that will likely be falling on me within a few months from now that and this crumbling relationship only friendship and the farthest one has ever got for me are starting to push me to the end of the line im finding myself randomly breaking down more often and i feel like unless something drastic happens ill explode the best visual representation of this its fairly stupid and niche i know is a scene in umbrella academy ep trying not to spoil anything where a big problem was averted then this was celebrated and then the crisis comes back with more ferocity than before in an extremely short amount of time,1
for a while now ive had visions and thoughts of myself being dead or committing suicide and how all my loved ones would react but i never have planned to do it or even have come close to at all because i dont want to really die i just dont want to feel this way and i dealt with them for so long i thought it was normal i told my friend and he was shocked that i had thoughts like that i guess i became so used to it i saw nothing wrong with them since i never actually wanted to commit suicide,1

im still young but ive been depressed for years now all throughout this people have told me many times that it will get better it doesnt get better all by itself it doesnt just happen the effort that is required to start making my life better and getting better myself is something that i simply cannot put into it right now i have tried countless times and failed every single time the more succesful attempts at recovering never lasted either and its always gotten as bad as things had been before even if i do get better is it even worth it im constantly suffering right now and my brain feels like a torture prison that im forever stuck inside of i could end that pain right now instead of working hard and regaining a bit of control over my life but this world sucks i dont think living in it can even be that great im not sure if im willing to dedicate so much effort just to live in this piece of shit society im tired,1

i took a gap yr i fumbled my first semester at school and im not smart enough to even do a stem degree everything else is seen as useless degrees and those same useless degrees are the only thing im passionate abt but i dont know if im smart enough to transfer to those either everyone elses life seems so straight forward they go to uni and make tons of friends and then get a great job but my life is a huge convoluted mess i spent all day today trying to think of solutions im finally trying to be pragmatic instead of crying and feeling trapped and fuck me it is hard,1
for the past years ive m struggled with depression i guess it started with the very turbulent divorce of my parents a violent fuckfest when i was yo in it was at that time that i started doing drugs such as mdma lsd and cocaine however id say my drug consumption really started as young as given that i would abuse my adhd medication ritalin by snorting it later down that year i had some pretty shitty moments with my mother physical violence as my father abandoned us to go live in another country for half the year when he came back they found out about my drug usage which again ended up in physical abuse and the over infantilization of a yo boy who never had any freedom or power in his life my parents started walking me to school it was blocks away from home lmao once they even punched me infront of my classmates and threatened some random boy about beating him up because they confused him with someone i smoked weed with at the end of that year they sent me to love with my grandma in another country there i was all alone in a country that was foreign to me although i was born there i had family of course but i cant really be myself around my family the year was and i was just starting classes again when the pandemic hit it was at that point when i abandoned my studies for the first time tbh i didnt suffer through covid because i lived with my cousin and we played videogames all day but i ended up drinking a ton of alcohol in secret again sniffing gas from the stove stealing pills from my grandma because i was desperate life felt like it physically weighted on me i stopped eating because sadness did not allow me to i started getting weaker and weaker untill onths later my mother picked me up and we returned to tje country i was raised in it did not get better for a long time my mother did not trust me at all and didnt allow me to go outside i was at the time she even hid the keys from me as i realized that she would never trust me again i said fuck it and started smoking weed again yadda yadda i start studying again and pass the year yay but still i was a yo boy who isolated himself for years and didnt talk irl to anyone that wasnt family i developed a serious internet addiction due to it in stuff got slightly better but not really during summer break i met a girl yo online and we start talking we like each other the first time i left my house in years for something that wasnt school was to meet her which i did at the cemetery i was later in that year i get into an altercation with my mother and she beats me again and kicked me out of her house after that i live with my father for a couple weeks before she decided to ask me to come back home again she never said sorry i get even more depressive to the point i abandon my studies again then i become years old and this yo girl i talked about before asks to unvirgin me to which i said yes she invited me to her brothers bday party when everyone went to sleep we were in bed together i was sleepy and high and she was drunk and coked tf up we had a very awkward kiss i then say that i forgot to bring condoms and she mounts me anyway before i could say anything after that shitty experience we become a couple my first girlfriend ever yay fuck it was a rollercoaster of shit she was abusive she offered me coke after i was clean for years she insulted me and said i was only useful for sex she even slapped me a couple of times why does everyone abuses me now i have my first job but i still struggle with my weight which makes me very self aware of how weak and small i am i feel ugly i feel emasculated now i have to study again and i just cant keep up with study and work my work shift goes from am to pm and my classes go from pm to am i just want to give up i feel like i dont deserve anything i just want to sleep and sleep and wake up when everythings allright sorry i dont know why i wrote this sorry for the english,1
im on luvox and its making me physically sick stomach ive just been to the mental hospital twice and they put me on lithium i dont see any marked improvement,1
for the last week and a half i have gone completely cold cut with my meds mg wellbutrin mg effexor and my mental state is the worst it had been in a long time im extremely sad and tired i eat next to nothing during the day and devour junk food during the night but i feel like i can laugh again when i read a stupid joke or see a sarcastic tiktok and those little moments are making me sure im not going back to meds,1
my best friend moved away last summer and while i still talk with them on the phone its not the same my other friend has got a girlfriend and opted to not talk to me anymore for some reason im insanely jealous of him i just want somebody besides my parents to talk to to lean on to love rn im stuck with plants ii just want someone to love im only and i feel like im going to die alone i dont have unreasonable goals for myself my only goal in life is to have a wife and family in the future but i feel itll never happen to someone like me i feel kind of dead inside i dont know how exactly to describe it i just feel so a l o n e,1
ive been struggling with my depression for years along with having no friends the whole time and my girlfriend who had planned our whole future together left me so now i have noone ive tried meds and therapy but nothing has helped my family is just a huge mess on every side and i just have given up ive lost faith in ever really being happy again even my hair has become ruined ive had long hair a majority of my life and its how i like it but its now thinning and receding im not even i really dont know what to do,1
im a bad person ive done terrible things i cant stand to live with how do i start trying to right my wrongs and make a positive influence on people and my community not trying to balance out the equation to feel better just need to do right any opinions appreciated,1
man ive been living with this feeling since like roughly years ago but only got diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety about a year ago now i mean im only this year last year was rough i couldnt enjoy anything in life everyday i mean i still dont i stopped taking my antidepressants and seeing my therapist on a random day i havent looked back since i dont think its possible to get completely rid of this feeling being utterly miserable unlovable a waste of space it stays with you hearing a professional tell me i was mentally ill felt like a truck hauling a bus had ran me over but that acknowledgment was merely confirmation that i wasnt crazy im not like the ordinary person who is able to smile without hiding their true self the person who can be optimistic the person who doesnt think twice about hanging with friends and loved ones man i am at the infancy of this journey i am terrified every day i dont want to wake up but i do everyday i dont want to bathe but i do i dont want to talk but i do i dont want to walk my dogs but i do sometimes all i can do is just wake up why wont this feeling just leave me be but its fine if this is my slice of hell fuck me someone else has it worse out there at least i have a community granted not everyone or anyone will read this but its importance is justified i have a space i can just cry and rant about how much i fucking hate it all and they get it fuck me man i mean i hope i eventually get this monkey off my back but were likely to become friends before such a thing happens,1
im in the army and i have not been able to receive the help that i need a lot of my friends are struggling as well im considering sacrificing myself and committing suicide so that i can be a symbol for those suffering in my unit i cant do this anymore,1
i feel stuck in place i want to move forward but decisions ive made in the past have not turned out well so i worry that the next decision will be another failure instead of moving forward then depression and loneliness destroy my motivation to do much of anything loneliness and the fact that i express love and desire through touch makes my libido rage but awkwardness and introvert tendencies make it hard to connect but the longing for connections makes me make bad decisions in my wish for connection and intimacy it all feels like too much if i didnt have work i feel like i would just sleep all the time even the things that used to help playing video games reading watching movies and shows bring me less and less joy as time moves on sometimes im even angry that i was born at all not that ive never had happy moments but they get lost in the sea of depression so here i float on these waters with no land in sight,1
i dont know what the hell im doing i feel ive wasted my life away i feel like a failure for the life of me i cant do anything right i truly feel like dying would be so much easier for me suicide has been so rampant in my mind not that i have the courage to do it but sometimes i wish a car on the road would just come and take me away,1
all i have managed to do today is get dressed and eat a few grapes and obviously post this message ampxb i know how bad my depression is but when i have days like today i think i often forget just how bad it is,1
im not formally diagnosed with depression so i hope you dont mind me posting im schizotypal british so its not a pd over here its under schizophrenia and autism but they havent diagnosed anything to do with my mood which is much needed tbh anyway im having a tough time again and i constantly feel like im about to cry this is fine when im alone but right now im staying with my mum after nearly dying from necrotising pancreatitis i keep actually starting to tear up but i yawn to cover it up and pretend im just getting watery eyed does anyone know how i can get rid of the crying reflex im not asking for any magical way to feel better i understand theres no fix for that im just looking for a tip to mask it better i dont want my family constantly worrying about me thanks,1
i need help idk how to do this anymore i need help i need someone to tell me its okay i need help please,1
so good he has the sound i need yey ampxb ekkstacy,1
i just dont see a point to my suffering i dont understand it i want to know what ive done so wrong to deserve everything id say sorry and do anything to make it stop i already have a burial plot in my home town due to my family buying some after my father over dosed on a cocktail of pain meds i know im not perfect im sorry if i could be better mentally and get plastic surgery to look better if i knew if i could just change i would im tired im so tired i have nothing to keep me here i honestly believe even my boyfriend is probably just waiting for me to realize that he doesnt actually like me im just tired im living any more my closest friend knows what to do when i die,1
back when i was in high school i was struggling to make friends and didnt have the greatest of home lifes either my parents argued all the time and at times when they had no form of release for their anger and frustration i would end up their verbal punching bag or in extremely rare cases physical action would be taken as well back then i was on a constant mental decline due to loneliness and solitude i constantly found my self in in order to try and combat it i did theater programs run through my school the high school i was at is know for their theatre programs as well as their music department though run by about teachers the school was known for how much it did within the field the shows had thousands of dollars spent on them each year the music students took trips to music competitions with everyother year taking them to a competition in nyc i loved theatre even did quite well in it up until i was about but it wasnt the environment of the school that got me into it it was the fact that all the students seemed to friends with each other casts of the school shows seemed like familys at times and with my home life the way it was i wanted something like that so i joined the select choir that led to me being subtly hinted at to audition for the schools shows well as subtle as people in that field could be i did so hoping to join the family they created and got into the shows and was a part of the cast every year now long story short i was never accepted fully into their family it was those teenage years where they had already determined friend groups but it allowed me time away from home for as many hours as possible so some days with rehearsals or performances i would be at the school starting at am until pm so i dedicated myself to the shows they were the one thing that really kept me going cut my senior year i was known for being a bad student amongst my peers i never did homework because i would be too depressed at home to do it so many teachers would yell at me in front of other students in attempts to get me to improve my habits none of it worked though mostly due to the fact that test scores could easily out weigh a students homework score to create a passing grade and with me never really getting below a percent on any test it led me to focus on theatre instead i loved it at this point the fall semester i was planning to audition for colleges and try to make a career out of this not only that but my school vocal director who doubled as the musical director chose a show we were gonna be dumping money into i mean i think the show spent around k fabrics imported for india a large bell was made so it could be rung on stage without making a sound costumes rented from the former professional touring production it was a lot i was excited for the year my fellow seniors were all really talented and it felt like for once i had a piece of the future to look forward to even if it was only months worth of future it didnt last long though before the call back list was posted one day many of us were hanging out in the vocal directors classroom one girl was sitting behind the desk of the director since it was the most comfortable chair there when she started going though some of the directors things when pressed about it she said she was looking to see if her boyfriend at the time had made it into the show if he didnt then shed have to do her senior show without him another guy started to help her out of what i could only assume to be a mixture of bordem and curiosity when they stumbled apon a mock call back list as well as peoples rating for their auditions the guy realized that they shouldnt be doing this and backed away to talk to others while the girl looked around asking others to look at it all for her i wanted friends so i did i told her that her boyfriend had a good audition and when other students pressed me about out it we talked about the call back list the director eventually found out that people were going through her desk and when she asked other students about it they all said i had done it in search of the call back list none of them said that anything about the other two students they didnt tell her how i just read out what they had found they placed everything on me i dont know why they all did this i dont think i ever will but it led to the director to looking to see if i had done anything else apparently at this point other students had claimed that i said that a girl wasnt in the call back list and it saddened her to the point of tears first off that was wrong because i distinctly remember saying that she had a damn good chance to get the leading role along with everyone else on that list for it she was and still is extremely talented and ive never claimed anything else next these students said i read the transcript of a math class for another student and bullied them for it now with this i did read this transcript the student had left it out on a table in the vocal classroom for about weeks and one day i picked up and read it made a comment about to to other students in the room and put it back on the table it was unknown to me at the time that student had dropped out hence why he never came to retrieve the paper and why itd been there so long i know the entirety of that situation because i had reached out to him to apologize when people started to blame me for him dropping out he told me it was fine and didnt know what was happening because he made and followed through on that decision far before any of this happened unfortunately for me though the director only heard that the student dropped out and that i according to others had bullied him she pulled me aside one day to tell me how disappointed she was in me she told me how she knew everything id done and that theres no reason to attempt to lie about anything she said i was the reason that kid dropped out and that i robbed her of the chance to save him she said i violated her trust by going through what must have been all of her things to find the audition information and she said that she couldnt believe i would lie to people and tell others that a girl wasnt up for a role where she really was i didnt know what to do the director what certain in what she knew and i knew she wasnt changing her mind on any of it so i just through tears said i was sorry that i didnt mean to hurt anyone the director was like a mother to me and now she was pinning all these things to me and i didnt know what to do so as punishment she wanted me to apologize to the girl i was to never be in her classroom without her being there and that she couldnt in good faith help me with any college auditions she finished it all off by saying that because of this all she didnt know if she could ever trust me again it broke me i isolated myself for the rest of the school year she thankfully still let me be in the show that year but i tried to not talk to many people at rehearsals if i wasnt spoken to first i applied for other degree fields at colleges and outside of school i rarely spoke to anyone unless it was online gaming i didnt perform for over year after that i couldnt get myself to be near a stage i eventually got the courage to audition for the theatre department at the college i attended and got in but after a year and a half the anxiety of being around a stage and performing and the anxiety that i would just be someones scape goat or disappointment again led to major problems for me i developed a severe panic attack and anxiety disorder and my body would start literally breaking down under the stress of it all leading at points to trips to the er for internal bleeding i quit performing for good after that i havent been on a real stage since i was and i havent performed since i was im now and i dont know what to do i had to drop out of college because of my mental health my father has threatened to kick me out of the house because my choice to leave school and when my mother opposed his idea threatened to divorce her and list me as the causeim stuck in a deadend job working hours a week and ive lost all will to do anything i dont know what to do ive lost everything and have no one i just wanted friends and ended up here i have a therapist but even after sessions i just leave feeling empty how do i keep going like this,1
like my sleeping habits have started to make my life feel worse usually i cant sleep until am most of the time it takes longer i do like all nighters a week whenever i do one i start to hear this whistling a melody every morning i have an alarm and i automatically turn it off while sleeping i cant get a hold on my sleeping habits melatonin doesnt work,1
i f have chronic depression but until two years ago i dealt with it more or less good in the past couple of years i have experienced a lot of things that can be sand and other traumatic and emotionally exhausting at this point of my depression or life im starting to get upset and mad i just get annoyed i have violent impulses when never in my life i have been a violent person on the contrary im always super peaceful and conciliatory but now at any inconvenience i want to break windows i want for people to stop calling me resilient i want to punch walls and scream my therapist which was great at teaching me how to deal with things in healthy manners now seems annoying and making me feel like being upset is not healthy and it might not but at this point im exhausted of feeling sad or defenseless or disappointed,1
theres nothing more i just want to die,1
i f are slowly coming to terms with the fact that i might be suffering with depression im getting to this conclusion through having noticed the change in myself and through gentle research and sharing thoughts with a very dear and extraordinarily patient friend im reluctant to seek professional help but i dont think im sustainable like this i just wanted to ask if there was anyone from the uk who could sort of tell me what would happen if i were to go to the gp and seek help thank you,1
for the first time after a long standing build up of intense anxiety and depression i sought out for help diagnosis and medication i was overwhelmed with what i got from professionals which include two great psychiatrists and therapists it is ptsd generalized anxiety disorder major depressive disorder and social anxiety disorder medication has helped and having the answers of a diagnosis has been very validating but i am struggling to piece all of these together and figure out where i am supposed to go from here has anyone else experienced these multiple diagnosis,1
m i know im just whining but idk what to do with myself anymore its only getting worse the few people i thought cared about me probably dont i cant get myself to eat i feel really lonely all day long and im just annoyed with myself ive going to psychologist for around a month now but i havent really opened up to her yet bc im scared i dont even know why im making this post im sorry,1

my boyfriend has been struggling with depression for years he was on medication in high school but ended up dropping it once moving to uni his mental health is directly affecting his grades and classes and the worse he does the worse he feels he wont see a therapist because he finds them insulting and he sometimes wants to get back on medication but he doesnt know where to start and ends up running out of energymotivation how can i help him hes sweet and gentle and so so smart it hurts seeing him like this i worry so much for him i have a moderatesevere anxiety disorder and i just want to make it easier for him i love him so much,1
every minor inconvenience makes me want to hurt myself idk how to stop it,1
i dont like being sick but i like getting sick because it gives me a reason to lie in bed all day and not be criticized from it and not seem lazy,1
so you know how whenever someone is depressed or feeling out of hope in life people say stuff like oh dont worry it gets better nothing lasts forever well ive been depressed for a while now and some of the causes of my depression dont seem to have a solution it even looks like it most likely will get worse with time how would you advice me with this situation or help me be more optimistic about my life,1

tw thoughts of self harm drug abuse suicidal thoughts m if you care first things first i really need to vent right now and dont know if anyone is even gonna read that but i just need to get this out of my head and sorry if my english isnt good so ive been battling depression for over a decade ive mostly gotten better after years of therapy and carefully choosing the people around me so ive been pretty stable for a few years with less and less backlashes today marks the first day after about years where im getting extremely intense thoughts about self harming drug abuse and even suicidal thoughts ive already been in a pretty bad mood today overthinking a lot and shit like that and i had to go to social event i didnt really wanna take part in but usually it turns out better than expected it wasnt like that today ive felt even worse and useless despite my friends trying to cheer me up and realized that im not good at anything i tried to drink those thoughts away with some cocktails which usually works wonders for me in social events but that just made it worse since i got home ive just been sitting on my bed and staring at the wall my thoughts going through a downward spiral i drank some more and feel better and worse at the same time ive even got to the point that i noticed another issue i havent even realized before but makes so much sense comparing it to the events in my life then i thought of numbing my pain with a method i used years ago forced myself not to because the scars have almost faded out then i thought about what drugs i could use to distract my mind even started to research before i stopped myself and decided to rant here im very aware of my thoughts which makes me instantly feel regretful and even more like a shitty person i just want to cry and try to vent through that but thats something i still cant do love society for teaching boys that they arent allowed to cry anyways i hope i can force myself to focus on something else now that ive written this shit down my mind does feel a bit clearer now without taking some extreme steps also to everyone reading this i hope you have a great day tomorrow and maybe we can all fight our inner demons some day and live a better life just trying to survive one day at a time,1
because now im angry that im sad,1
it creeps up on me more and more every day i cant sleep very well and i cant eat much anymore i shake constantly im unable to sit still im unable to rest i get maybe hours of sleep maximum i dont even cry anymore i am just blank i keep losing more and more weight cause i find it hard to eat or enjoy food i keep cleaning myself and my belongings constantly to keep me occupied i really cant do this anymore i do know how much longer i have a will to live,1

real life examples of greedy people racists bullies narcissists etc,1
i decided i will live life the way i want try new thing welcome only good hearted people into my life if it didnt work out i can kill myself anyway my body my choice,1
my eyes begin to swell up with tears even before i begin to write i am a year old girl struggling to find hope i wish i could extract everything in my brain and export it onto this reddit post instead of having to type out and remind myself of why i feel like this but im hoping ill only have to do this once you know i try really fucking hard i practice gratitude whenever i can everyday i wake up and i journal i tell myself im grateful i am healthy that i have both my legs and both my arms attached that i have a roof over my head that i have vision that i have a heart that beats and so on you get the point i try and i romanticize my life i try and enjoy my morning coffee extra hard i try and be present i try to enjoy the mundane things about life just as much as the big extravagant things but the truth is my first distinctive memory is disassociating for the first time when i was years old i remember zoning out because of the fights that would go on at home i remember being depressed before the word depressed was ever even introduced to me i felt like a zombie as a child i felt like i was always outside of my body looking in i felt different like my soul was not meant to be here i lived my life very alone i never had anybody and i filled the voids through whatever caught my attention in the end we all day why are we here whats our purpose in the grand scheme of things nothing matters really nothing matters the world would be okay without mewhats funny is to others i am a bubbly sweet kind happy girl people would be shocked to see this side of me ive tried i hope that is evident i just think the more you know about life the more youve been through the more you realize how meaningless all this is is what makes you detach and unhappy,1
been fighting for years im fucking tired of getting treatment that does jack shit fucking tired of being a lb burden to my parents im just fucking sick of trying to get help only for it to lead to me getting worse i just wanna put a gauge slug into my heart im fucking tired of being so goddamn paranoid all the time about if the people closest to me r joking im fucking tired of my deppression being a reason that romantic relationships end im fucking hate not remembering what i was like before this shit got me im fucking tired of being alive im just gonna end it all tonight everything ive tried had ended in me getting worse and ive tried everything,1
this is going to sound so self indulgent because i really have managed to make a great life for myself in so many respects im a man in my late s and i have already seen and done things that very few people on earth ever have i have a great career making six figures own my own houseproperty i have a great relationship with all of my family i have cultivated so many friends over the years im a rock in many peoples lives im the guy people can count on to help them out with anything they need i love people and helping people i was an idiot in my s chasing the one that got away in a toxic on again off again relationship and when i finally thought it was all going to work out i got cheated on by her with a guy twice our age years later she wrote me a letter apologizing for it all i fell into depression and let myself go after this i came out of it and managed to find purpose in my work and hobbies i lost lbs to get in shape and nothing for whatever reason i cant find love ive literally traveled to every continent on earth made a lot of money taken care of my physical appearance and for whatever reason i still cant find anyone who loves me which makes it all feel so hollow i dont feel like anyone owes me love im just sad and depressed that halfway through my life i cant say that ive ever truly received it despite trying pretty hard to find it for a long time recently i started seeing a girl who i thought had the potential to be the one for months and now she has had some freak personal trauma unrelated to me but that is causing her to push me away and now im just sitting here in my empty house again i wanted to have a family and every day it feels like its more likely it will never happen i am not suicidal in any way but it definitely feels like dying on the vine inside each day that passes,1
god i feel so helpless and defeated i dont feel like living this week birthday was spent alone and awful friends ghosted me for no reason the woman ive seen for years has no kind of empathy for me my job uses me and doesnt respect me i have nothing going for myself nobody cares about me,1
im currently in therapy and were talking about being more social with friends as well as setting boundaries my therapist is aware of a friend group i have about my only close friend group of guys im a girl boys like to roast and they like to be really really mean i often question why im still friends with them at this point because i cant talk to them about personal issues we no longer all have the same interests i have a career and they dont so having moneynot having money affects us actually doing things such as traveling which i always want to do but scared to do alone and theyre my only options but really when i think about it i just dont enjoy their friendship theres one friend in particular who always brings up my ex even though ive asked numerous times to not update me on what hes doing im currently trying to recover from that emotionally amp mentally abusive toxic relationship matter of fact hes the reason why i spiraled a few weeks ago because he brought up something about without even warning me circling back to the roasting they will so easily bring up this trauma as a roast and something to laugh at invalidate my mental illness and make fun of me for attending therapy because im wasting money for someone to tell me im normal i fucking hate that i cant seem to let go of their friendship despite how awful i feel about all of them but i feel like without them i dont have anyone to do things with or talk to all the time idk what to do its either be alone and have them in case or just be alone period and obviously that will just continue this cycle of loneliness and dark depression wtf do i do,1
long story short went through his phone to turn alarms off checked up on him because i finally gave a ultimatum drugs vs me guess the drugsampthe drug dealers are more importantmental gymnastics later i feel bad after a fight and bam again im caving in me looking or getting upset is why he doesnt tell me or why he lies blah blahblah him starting a argument copying my breathing technique to calm myself down only made me realize how much im starting to resent him my depression has increased again because bingo i cant trust this man i adore to stay on the straight and narrow been trying to power through today but fuck i want to smash something leave run away say fuck everyone and take off im not going too through im going to sit and be fucking useless why the fuck does he want a relationship and why tf cant i let go of this assholeso new plan take care of myself and he can fuck off for awhile he can go do whatever he wants and so will i im tired of being depressed if i dont change ill ko myself eventually i love my children and him more than i hate myself to do that to them so i guess its time to start learning how to live for myself for once,1

this has probably talked about so many times on here but i dont know where else to turn to about this i so deeply wish i was terminally ill or had cancer i want a time limit on my life as ive just given up im not healing and im not declining i dont want to kill my self but im not exactly happy and thriving either if i had a time limit i can at least try and enjoy before i have to go and i dont have to let people down by killing myself if i had the option i would rot in my bed but i keep pushing maybe one day things will get better im not even a quarter way through my life i dont want people upset or disappointed in me either but each second i feel my body just weighs more and more to the point i cant even lift my arms and not in the physical sense but life is just a struggle now and being ill would be a great reason a great excuse if i had cancer i wouldnt even do chemo i would just accept my fate i just want this to be over and done with id be less afraid too im horrified of death losing my conscious and it being able to happen at any moment but if i knew id have a timer things would seem much more easier,1
this time of year is rough for me because its an anniversary of a near suicide attempt years ago im recently married and ive been having the worst time with this because i feel that i cant have these feelings i have obligations to other people now my husband we are trying to start a family and if i show signs of depression what kind of confidence does that give him for me as a mother he knows that im having a hard time right now and he is just trying to go on like everything is fine what can he do im fine and i have been for several years without the aid of medication but i have continued therapy i dont see him again for over a week though before when i would get depressed i was able to keep to myself and process it on my own but now i cant do that because of my new life i dont know how to let this pass if i cant let it run its course,1
maybe its a mixed episode well never know,1
i cant think of a single scenario in which i would have a happy life i feel like my destiny was set at birth through a series of unlucky factors i had a difficult childhood cause i suffer from ocd and visited a specialist every week until i was now im pretty good with this also i was born both extremely ugly and boring so i will never find someone who loves me and trust me ive been searching for long and im tired of suffering cause nobody likes me im also extremely anxious and its a torture for me to even walk into a shop and having to talk with the cashier and lastly even though im truly good at school im sure that ill never get a job cause i dont like doing anything and im angry to myself for studying so much instead of trying to enjoy what should have been the best years of my life and which were a nightmare instead and thus i wont even go to uni i cant see how things can go well im just waiting to die at this point i go to bed each night praying of not waking up in the morning,1
i find my self often being the one who is there for others yet at the end of the day no one is there for me it hurts deeply knowing that everything i do wont be reciprocated i just wish someone could be there for me as i am so often there for them,1

im ive never had any friends i feel completely unsatisfied with my existence but most important i dont see good future for myself recently my family moved to another country because of war and now i understand that i have no chances to fulfil my dreams i have no idea what do i want to do and whom do i wanna become in this life all my free time i spend listening to music this and the fact that my family is in a safe place now are the only things that gives me power to move forward but still im jealous to everyone who always hangs out with their mates i feel like i am no one i am nobody i am weakness itself what should i do to become someone i am tired of understanding the fact that i am who i am that i am nobody,1
ive done a lot of horrible things to people in my past im a pathological liar that has constantly manipulated people to make sure either myself or the other person didnt get hurt at least in the moment ive used people and thrown them out like trash after i was done ive dealt with adhd anxiety and depression for over a decade now my ex and i broke up almost years ago it was a horribly messy and terrible break up that caused me to be suicidal we both made mistakes there was never any closure and it always felt like it should have ended differently it often felt like she felt the same as wellat least back then think she might resent me now been having some real down moments lately and ive been thinking about my ex a lot im still attached to those days and emotionally often feel stuck there theres still a giant piece of me that belongs to her ive been in a fairly healthy relationship for the past years but i have quite a few things i lied about in the early parts of our relationship i feel like its so unfair to her its not fair that im with her and emotionally stuck with my past or that ive lied to her its not fair that the thing i desperately want to talk about is my ex so i avoid that trauma with her any advice or thoughts,1

hello i am male and twenty years old and actually i have a great life i have great parents and a brother i was successful in sports until my injury and i finished school very successfully a few years ago in the meantime i have also almost finished the first part of my studies and i am successful there as well in addition i have a great albeit small but fine group of friends somehow i have been feeling weak and tired for some time now and cant really motivate myself to do anything i think a lot especially about the past my school days were difficult at the beginning because i was bullied i am almost highly gifted and always had difficulties to get into a really casual conversation with other people also i had different interests than kids my age after i changed schools the situation was immediately better and i had made real friends for the first time and also developed selfworth i just went through with school and left all the dating stuff alone following the motto will come around then i have time at the same time it was always difficult in my family too my depressed and schizophrenic grandmother hates my parents even though she lives next door to them the whole thing goes so far that she says things like she would rather be dead than live next to people like my parents because i moved out to study i was able to escape this somewhat but it still depresses me because i am her only confidant some time ago i tried dating and was only disappointed and hurt i had not thought that rejection offends me so much however i have always been able to pick myself up again after recovery periods and continue then about two and a half months ago i met a girl completely unexpectedly and unfortunately online who completely enchanted me and vice versa as well she doesnt live quite nearby but i have no problem with having to drive and its not so far that we cant see each other every weekend we then had together after a few meetings also our respective first kisses and now just look where the journey goes this feeling that i can actually be attractive and appealing is indescribable to me and i have noticed how much i have always missed physical closeness the last few years although i never wanted to admit it and have always denied the whole thing triggers a total existential crisis for me and throws me off track everything i have lived for the last few years now seems useless and disgusts me i read my resume and am disgusted by the stringing together of courses successes and professional experiences i feel bad because for the last few years ive always laughed at couples for not getting the rest of their lives together i feel bad because ive always tied my selfworth to achievement and now i see and feel that thats not actually what its worth living for but that it is love that one should live for am i depressed and do i need professional help my problem is that as a future civil servant i could then have problems with the medical officer and then no civil service relationship could come about do you have similar experiences or tips on how i should best deal with this,1
since i was young i saw how unhappy my parents were with their corporate jobs from a young age i wanted to learn more about the world and see different cultures and experience different things and didnt want to end up hating my career ever since graduation all ive felt is failure towards my own life ill see old classmates traveling or starting a home business and living on a beach house in hawaii and im honestly super happy for them but at the same time it hurts i look to my life and see that ive fallen into exactly what ive feared most i work a blue collar job in a factory working long hours living paycheck to paycheck i look back at the year old kid i was and wish i could have slapped more sense into him to not worry so much about what family would think if i didnt go the traditional route if id just taken the steps i wanted to be who i wanted to be and not so frightened of them but now im sitting at work at pm getting ready for a hour shift regretting how stupid i was as a kid for letting myself be pushed away from trying something new to fall into the or in my case rhythm that my family hated so much but pushed so hard for my body is tired i just want to sleep and dream again,1
everything and everyone annoys me and im annoying to everyone lifes fun innit also reddits been depressing me everyones fake to get karma as soon as someones honest theyre eliminated cool,1
i have no friends at this point due to either my own mistakes or just things not working out i had a falling out with my family so im essentially nc with them and on top of that i recently moved to an entirely new state i had to sell a lot of my belongings that helped me cope with my depression such as my laptop and ps my partner is a fantastic person and the moments i get to spend with him everyday are a blessing he has similar issues but i insisted he kept his computer since thats his lifeline on top of that he has numerous social circles who adore him ive been having a terrible depression spout just due to the new location and lack of socializing and it stings when im awake at night sad and alone and i hear him talking to one of his many friend groups they play games have fun just hang out hell do this all night and i have to sleep and wake up to him having fun i asked him to keep his belongings and i love that he has friends but i just get so upset that he has things that i just cannot have a loving family friends who would never replace him games he can play it makes me so irrevocably depressed that i just cant have those things for some reason i have autism adhd and social anxiety and i try to communicate my jealousy to him but at the end of the day it isnt his problem i want him to be happy but im upset that he can do these things which is shitty of me to even feel how do i get over it how do you even make friends when youre just a piece of shit person with no good qualities im tired of being so damn lonely whats the point of doing things if i cant even share them i love to read and write but im not even motivated to do those things because i cant talk about them to anyone it got so bad last night i burned myself with a lighter took some tylenol pm and just slept despite sleeping all day already i dont know what to do,1
male i have been struggling with depression on and off for the past years practically every day i would have mood swings but the past years have been terrible working out eating healthy or trying to meet new people doesnt help i become angry easily though i was homeschooled and clearly have social problems i am capable of keeping a conversation going i dont have any friends i really hang out with and have a total of online friends with whom i interact with regularly i have not committed suicide due to religious reasons i have experienced loss of a loved one and have not been able to move on i am supposed to finish ged this year but get too frustrated of reading so much and getting answers wrong i do not enjoy playing games or consuming media anymore every day feels like decay i have considered taking antidepressant medication but i dont know how and i can already tell that my parent would be strongly against the idea i genuinely do not know how to go on,1
for a little context ive been suffering from primary anxiety and secondary depression as my former therapist would say ive dealt with this therapy and medications since the age of i am now i am sick of it i did the whole change in environment moved miles from home while i was lucky enough to do so a short year went by and with many significant losses im back to square one i dont want to return to the medications or the headache of retrieving my backstory to yet another therapist i feel defeated ive worked on myself so hard these last few years i read somewhere today depression is treatable not curable it hit me hard i broke down crying recalling all my efforts my question is how how can we live with these mental illnesses without being pumped with drugs everyday or cramming therapy sessions every week to feel normal is it even possible,1
my therapist is pushing me to come out to him and belives that this is the source of all my issues am not ready for that yet and i know that not all my issues exist because of this i want to discuss other topicsissues with him but he keeps redirecting the conversation to my orientation and i dont want to talk about that am having difficulty communicating with him and i dont know what to do my main issue is something else but he keeps focusing on this topic what do i do,1
almost everyone i have encountered within my life has been abusive to me plenty of people are abusive unintentionally but ignorance is not an excuse to neglect andor abuse and use people i almost think it is worse when they are not self aware because then those people will continue to do it over and over and over again to countless others feeling blame free no one likes being called out as an abuser either though so it seldom goes well when you try to bring it to light sighs i become so exhausted with trying to make anyone understand me or my feelings half the time it is met with rejection and the other half is self loathing for being a pitiful creature more times than not i think i deserve this to feel this way because of that thinking i push myself into doing things i do not have energy for interest in things that cause me so much pain that it physically manifests and makes me ill i lie to people and over extend myself as long as it pleases them i invite more abuse in because i am certain that i deserve it i have lost so much will to fight for myself anymore and my sad truth is i do not have anyone who is willing to fight for me i do not have anyone i can trust to hold up the walls when they start to collapse in i do not have anyone that i can genuinely believe in their words because there has never been real action to follow it it is just me and i have run empty now i do not even have steam to keep me going just a void where i used to be i have let people do such horrible things to me because i deserve it nightmares have haunted me for so long that i wake up screaming or crying most of the time i would keep inviting it too because even abuse means someone is there keeping you alive in some way i know im unhealthy but that goes with being sick i do not know what else to say i was just talking but even that had fatigued me now,1
i dont know how to say this i want to get this off my chest i have recently been released from a psychiatry after half a year and am now at a place where i have to do almost nothing i didnt even do anything to get there i just have to go there in the morning and leave after hours and i am too fucking incapable of even doing this how the fuck am i supposed to achieve anything if i already fuck up at getting out of bed i havent stood up on time once since i left the clinic i cant talk to people i cant not look like a damn newborn piece of shite that has no life experience at all in the public and i cant fucking do anything a normal person would without getting overwhelmed or getting exhausted i am at my limit from basically nothing so how am i supposed to achieve anything i am out of school which i barely managed to survive and dont have much time left before i have to leave my fathers place who is also responsible for me even having anything to do which i dont appreciate nearly enough and who puts way too much energy into keeping me afloat and move very far away i dont have the motivation to wake up in the morning for anything as it all feels unnecessary and hopeless there arent even people i care for not even my parents or something and the handful of friends i have only talk to me when no one else is available all of my school friends stopped talking to me the moment i left school i had a girlfriend but i didnt feel a bit of empathy at all which i broke to her a few months later now i yearn for the warmth i lost after that which i probably wont experience ever because i am on top of all that the most hideous insecure retarded fat piece of shit youll ever see i dont know what to do at all i dont know who to talk to and how i dont know if i can do this much longer for i have no reason to do it there is nothing that makes life worth living as i dont have any interest or motivation for anything i have so many problems that i cant list here that feel like theyll follow me to my grave i need help or someone to talk to i dont know,1
tell me why everything is going wrong stop telling me it will work out and be okay just tell me why please tell me why i cant sleep and when i do i sleep too long i dream of pain and i wake up and feel it the tears stain my pillows like oil they wont come out i cry at everything and now im angry for crying crying doesnt fix anything just tell me why,1
all i want is a hug a real tight one where i cant get out off easily i want to be squeezed my face reclined on their shoulders ears rubbed against theirs i yearn for a humans warmth i got no one in my life right now that i can truly be open with stuck in an environment where i feel caged suffocating in desperation to grasp anyone for hugs i want to lie down in someones bed converse with and sleep in their care i want to feel safe loved and shamelessly desired ive been depressed for so long it has become a part of my life at one point im smiling then enraged followed by desolation and despair im sad broken alone all i want is a hug a human touch that is all making art gives me comfort even if it is for a fleeting moment but besides that im broken too shattered to be pieced together i dont want pity nor fake niceness just a genuine hug a big bear hug,1
i can feel an episode comingggg its fucking terrible i know how bad it will get i just want to smash my head against the wall rn my social battery is dying out too like i can feel an episode hitting me and i dont want it to i hate it when i have depressive episodes like its just suicidal thoughts constantly and honest to god just thinking about it is eating away at me because i wish i could do anything to stop going into that fucking state but the cycle always repeats like the past days i had a really bad episode and i think these previous days it somewhat alleviated and i could actually move my body and interact with people and be fucking not miserable and have motivation to do shit but now another episode will hit me and ill return to just laying around all day rotting away for hours honestly fuck this its so frustrating not having any control over my god damn brain or emotions i hate it sm,1
f ive been struggling with depression for years now the main things that have been making everything worse are my family issues my parents are going to court soon for alleged threat to kill charges and i was forced to testify against my mother the court date is days from now and im losing my mind i never ever want to hurt people especially my family i always tiptoe around them and put them before myself but no one ever does the same for me no one even realised the state im in they only care about themselves and yet i always get blamed for their problems worries misfortunes etc ive only ever tried i try so hard to make everyone feel safe and happy i ran away from home start abusing substances lost so many people have internal self loathing deal with traumatising memories of getting constantly molested by my older brother started self harming and not eating life is a fucking cycle of everlasting pain,1

first off english isnt my first language so excuse me for the errors i could really use some help right now cause im so lost ive been drinking and smoking so much for the past few weeks its really starting to hurt me really bad but i think i just lost something special so basically i was in a relationship with this girl for around months we hit it off real good right from the start we used to hang around uni together and it felt so perfect i had to break it off with her since i wasnt really looking for anything serious and she insisted on only that ever since the beginning and even during our relationship she only prioritized friendship over us it was always friends friends friends for her we said wed balance both but somehow she didnt do anything much about us she also had a lot of guy friends that made me feel so bad about but i never got the nerve to tell her about how that made me feel seeing her dancing with all those guys post breakup sparked a different kinda anger in me i know i ended this but i was really hoping that we would atleast stay friends i told her how much she meant to me and even begged her to stay i just ended up blocking her her birthday is in a months time should i even bother wishing her what do you think my next move should be should i just let this die slowly should i move on is it okay for me to feel this way,1
idk man i feel like im too fucked up to be loveable anymore i have weird feminine mannerisms and limp wrist syndrome couldnt beat porn addiction and destroyed myself so much that my dick actually seems smaller trying to roll back alcoholism but instead of relapsing and actually drinking i get high off of sniffing concentrated hand sanitizer sometimes i sleep on the floor and hope i die very low drive to do anything,1
a plain and simple hi to begin most of this discussion will be off the top of my head and ill be adding my own experiences to start there are situations in life that we genuinely have absolutely no control over i myself suffer from mdd and struggle with it on a daily basis i take medication i try and get out more i see a therapist and im trying to find a job that would interest me im constantly worried about my future and whether i want to continue or not one thing that happens quite frequently is that i create non existent situations in my head which cause even more stress and anxiety once this cycle begins it doesnt matter what it is whether i have control over it or not its a nightmare to deal with this constant stress of anything that may happen why does this occur why are we as humans so unequipped to handle these challange one could say the society we are surrounded by and what is expected of us causes a drastic change in the way we look feel and think to an extent this is true but why is it so terribly exhausting and anxiety stricken to be able to even begin coping with what is going on around us its an obstacle i am incapable of clearing i worry about anything and everything that involves me and those close to me im consistently tired in pain anxious worried and have had this heavy weight on my chest each and every minute of everyday for over years nothing seems to change i keep telling myself tomorrow will be different ill do this and that and it will all be better but when the time comes i fall short i let myself down i let others down and most of all i continue the same cycle over and over again is this a situation or cycle ive made up to comfort myself as all i know is this feeling of dread and doubt and fear and anxiety or does it truly exist and hinder me am i really my own worst enemy why am i constantly at war with myself it feels like a never ending battle i fight back but i dont fight hard enough am i even capable of doing so just what exactly is it that im waiting for an idea a person an event or situation in my life these consist of things i can and cant control i feel as though i have no control over the majority of these things which further pushes me to feel as though i have control over nothing why do we have to suffer the way we do why are our minds and body working against us is it not the job of our brain to keep us alive and well its supposed to keep us alive for as long as possible and we even have built in ways of surviving dangerous situations but when it comes down to the core of it our brains are what control us our thoughts our actions and feelings yet its perfectly happy with the idea of us ending it,1
ok so i know ive got depression and anxiety recentl past months now ive noticed myself withdrawal from people i work in retail and spend all day doing customer service when i get home i spend all my remaining day in my bedroom any ideas on what i can do to motivate myself to get moving and do something with my time i currently feel like i wake up work and sleep i know thats being an adult but i feel something missing,1
i m have for the past months been seeing a cbt therapists after struggling with mental health and depression for the last years a point that irked me was that i never could pinpoint the cause of my mental deterioration so i assumed that my condition was just a result of an accumalation of bad experiences and circumstances in my later life i have one week of therapy left until i am given the choice to endcontineintensify therapy and ive lately been disheartened by how little they have helped something i never discussed with my therapist was that i believe i was sexually assaulted at age by my cousin f back in my home country as far as i know no one knows beside me and her and she seperated from the family a while back as her mother divorced if they did know they may have chosen to never tell me in the hope i was too young to remember the event the memory is so hazy that at times i question if it ever occured even then i like to think of it of had having no effect on my life but recently the memory has been surfacing more ive never looked back on this memory and thought of it as trauma i have no feelings for the memory at all but can something that i regarded as so insignificant result in symptoms many years later or am i merely grasping at any clue to the cause for my depression i feel sick when thinking of bringing it up to my therapist ive never told anyone but a very close friend of it how vital would this piece of info be to my therapist,1

i will admit that im a bit of a hypochondriac and have a lot of anxiety surrounding my health but im experiencing something ive never gone through before since sunday evening my whole body has been in extreme pain and i just have that feeling i get when im sick with something like a cold or the flu but those are my only symptoms ive had negative covid tests and just got a negative flu test from the doctor where they also did some lab work and gave me a prescription for my pain the only other explanation i can think of for the cause of this is that i got extremely depressed and stressed out last week im not new to stress or depression though and ive never had this type of reaction before just wondered if anyone had any ideas or has experienced anything like this im worried this is all in my head even though my pain feels very real and severe and it doesnt seem to be letting up at all,0

whatever youre trying to achieve save the world write a novel devote yourself to a particular cause there are likely to be those who will be critical some people just have a critical disposition while others will take issue with the specifics of your particular endeavour criticism is unavoidable your choice is in how to respond to it consider these strategies for managing the critics in your life clarify your purpose as humans we are compelled to make meaning making meaning for ourselves and value for others is fundamental to a life well lived when youre doing something very important to you you care far less about the criticisms of others if they can easily throw you off your path you might want to reflect on how important it really is to you are you living your purpose consistent with you values understand the critics motivation are they projecting themselves in to the situation their aspirations their skill set their propensity for risk their values are they genuinely trying to protect you from any potential downsides are they trying to maintain the status quo for you them or both are they masking their own lack of action recognise that criticism is not balanced appraisal we have evolved to notice negative issues more readily than positive ones we are more likely to notice criticism than encouragement people working against us over people supporting us most people are actually indifferent to you and your life so get on and live it realize that youre going to be criticized no matter what you do whether you become a billionaire movie star teacher doctor or sit on the couch all day there is someone that will tell you that youre doing the wrong thing so live your life building towards what you do want rather than what the critics dont want respond calmly rather than giving your critics the pleasure of an emotional response respond kindly with a considered response acknowledge any leaps of faith you are making use your critics as motivation while some people are intimidated and deflated by the critics of the world others are able to use the negative comments as a source of motivation remind yourself that while the critics are standing on the sidelines you are on the pitch and playing the game decide if they have something useful to say some criticism may carry valid points explore these with your critic and ask what their solution would be the response differentiates between useful and harmful dialogue if the criticism isnt useful move on you have more important things to do take criticism as a compliment most people will leave you alone if youre struggling or arent doing anything noteworthy you only become a significant target of negative comments if youre doing well if youre taking a lot of heat you must be doing something correct live your life without the need for the approval of others live your own life by your own values use your signature strengths to create meaning for you value for others and legacy for the future in your chosen pursuit i hope you took something useful from this piece i have posted a further series of quick reads on my own little corner of reddit would be great to see you there,0
society expects us to have kids house nice car and a successful career to be happy were brainwashed into following this dream right from school and put ourselves through great deal of stress pain and suffering unless youre born into wealth you have to give your life away and work for someone elses dream with the tales that one day you will have the same amount of wealth and along the way youre reminded how far away you are and compare yourself to others that have just that bit more than you you sacrifice your life freedom health relationship all for some pocket change and a supposed wealth while others are milking from your sacrifice this making you feel like a failure feeling like that dream is further and further away its a mindset you need to teach yourself a mindset where your head is clear and at every obstacle you need to tell yourself no matter what it is that youll be fine because life is too short and can change in an instant and then when your health suffers all of these aspirations and dreams do not matter ive been incidentally diagnosed with cancer was very lucky as theyve cut it out fairly quickly only nights in hospital painless procedure ive won a lucky dip with life because it was nothing but seeing people who care about me being so upset was a horrible experience i wanted them to be happy and stop worrying because ive never thought much of myself then why would they because i am nothing i am not worth anything low self esteem never had any aspirations goals only liked cars wasnt very social couldnt really talk to people and sat in my own head alot showing how much those close to me cared for me made me change when i lay in hospital my head was clear didnt worry about work buying a house savings or career only my family mattered and thats how ive learned this mindset and began adapting my life around it got rid of as much finance as i could paid off my phone sold the bmw bought a cheap fiat for cash financial freedom helped with not worrying about money began saving money for a deposit for my new house in the future i keep reminding myself to enjoy the little things in life going for a walk going to a gym or even buying something fancy to eat here and there on my weekly shop going restaurant and getting a carbonara or a new phone case ive started eating healthy and looking after my health i feel happy proud of myself and i live week by week of course i am aware i am very lucky and not everyone has the same opportunities in life and do not wish to upset anyone by this post i hope this helps someone to find their path in life,0

ill try to cut my story short in hope of someone out there being able to help me and guide me as i feel like i can no longer continue living with this feeling a general idea about myself is that i am a yrs old medical student i usually stress and worry a lot about medical school and my examinations regardless of the fact that i score the highest amongst my batch my story starts the summer of where i met a girl that goes to the same medical school as i do half way through the relationship problems start to arise between the two of us and i didnt think anything of them as all relationships have their ups and downs at this time my partner began to say bad and mean things to me when we fought which initially didnt affect me as i knew it was because of her being angry she also reassured me after the fight resolves that she didnt mean it this started to escalate in which the problems became more frequent and almost every time ive had hurtful things being said to me this progressively increased till the summer of months past for our relationship which was the same summer in which i would take my step exam a really important exhausting and dreadful exam at this point i used to always worry about our future and if were are even compatible i used to have a weird heart clenching feeling that is filled with worry and anxiety i also used to wake up from sleep several times with my heart racing or wake up before my alarm with the thought of our relationship overwhelming we had a fight around weeks before my exam which was my last straw and i communicated to my partner at that time that i want to end things as i felt i should communicate to her my true feelings that i no longer feel like i can continue in this relationship or think we have a future together the things that were said to me where the worse out of all fights she was devastated cried and begged for me to give her another chance as she will change herself i was heistant but decided to give her a chance it worked out for the first few days but then the same heart clenching weird anxious feeling returned i tried to battle it and not disclose it to her but eventually i couldnt hide it anymore and told her i couldnt accept and give her another chance around days before my exam the whole days and holiday after the exam was devastating i was really sad and down with time i used to distract myself and go out with friends i dont drink almost every other day which helped me try to forget the whole situation keep in mind that ive got several messages from my ex weeks after the breakup about how i was wrong and that she would never forgive me and other prayers similarly over the last couple of months its been months since our breakup ive been getting tiktok reposts from her account of videos taking about injustice and how saddevastated she was which always made me feel very guilty as i was the reason for her current feelings similarly it made me selfconscious about my decisions and doubt my feelings as she claims i never loved her and if i did i would never leave her fast forward to the last month months since breakup where i finally approached a girl in my class that was always getting my attention and i couldnt lay my eyes off her in the first days through text i was very happy and excited to get to know her three days later which was also when the new school year started and the week of my important sport tournament i started to have this same tiring coruscating and exhaustive heart clenching feeling as if there is something i am worrying about it started to increase progressively and ive always tried to forget it and keep it in the back of my head but it has been really taking a toll on me as i almost wake up everyday with this feeling and it stays throughout the day keeping in mind that throughout this period weve grown really close and she seems to really care about me i have this feeling in the background around of the day is me being distracted by work and friends and the remainder consist of me actually overthinking and worrying i really dont understand why is this happening a am i feeling guilty that i am meeting a new person b am i worrying that this new relationship may end like the previous one c am i scarred and no longer can commit to a relationship d why is the same feeling but less intensity that i was having before i left my ex happening again e is the person not compatible for me and i am still seeking my ex f did i still not move on from my previous relationship prior to the new girl i was certain that i did move on and had feelings but i brought it up now because i have no idea what is the reason for this feeling any input can help me understand this feeling that is taking a huge toll on me this is a previous post of what i felt with my ex that i posted d ago httpswwwredditcomrstepcommentswypbmmorninganxietylifeandrelationshipsutmsourceshareamputmmediumiosappamputmnameiossmf,0

before anyone asks no the problem is not coming from my supervisor hes kind willing to help and available for me if you ask me i wouldnt even say that i feel stressed before the meetings in the sense that im not overthinking im not having this bowl of stress in my belly that one could have facing pressure yet i dont know why systematically minutes before the meeting i go to the toilet and i throw up everything i have even if i had a light breakfast before i really dont know what can i do to stop this because it doesnt feel like the problem is coming from me it feels like i have no other choice but to throw up obviously its linked to the fact that im going to apply to a phd and the fact that hes a very knowledgeable man in his field and theres probably a bit of impostor syndrome playing but whats worrying me is the fact that of all the meetings we had so far i systematically throw up ive had other meetings with other supervisors when i was a research assistant for instance and it didnt happen probably because the stakes are lower what can i do to feel better,0

tldr questions at end regarding how to not care to disappoint when team and boss have seen my abilities boss has high aspirations for me this year or which if i fulfill im going to stretch myself so thin that i will leave or go into depression i was given a rather good yearly review and well incentivized but i am currently stressed and trying to figure out how to have less responsibilities when its desired i have more this is above and beyond the rest of my team boss sees my potential and not only wants it to continue but also have me lead more be more of a driver and influencer and upgrade my knowledge crossteam visibility all of which i do not want taking on any more work feels like im going to pop and im already near at burnout i hate disappointing and failing why i try harder than others on my team and also why im hate being in this position i am right now but im at my max currently near in burnout thinking or ways to get out my mindset is that id rather quit a fig job and go elsewhere take a break than disappoint and fail someone whom believes in me so wholeheartedly and knows how fast i can operate sadly ive shown my hand this past year of what im capable of but its unsustainable for my stress levels needed downtime and resetting ability and more is desired ive mentioned already to the boss that im burning the candle at both ends but its only been sprinkled throughout the year i also hate that i would them regret providing a large optional incentivized reward additionally if i fail its most likely no more of that and i would just be considered middle of the road im ok with that if someone didnt know my abilities but again i have pushed past capacity many times for tight deadlines and to get things done how do i change my mindset to not care about disappointing what if anything do i tell boss i feel i need to drop hints that this is too much and if im dead it does no one good absolutely sucks feeling capable but also having a hapicapied weakness of stress leading to depression what would you do if you were me with these concerns and yet burned out,0

i know life is supposed to be difficult i know stressful things can happen and that most of us learn how to cope in a healthy way eating right and exercising are supposed to make us healthy and happy both physically and mentally were supposed to have hobbies beginner at knitting to keep us occupied and to do our duties which manifests in the job that i do almost every day we need to have a network of support from friends and family life isnt just what happens to you its how you react to it thats what i tell myself yet it seems that life or at least my life is just one stressful event after another be it getting rearended and struggling with insurance for a few months a single parents boyfriend showing up who stresses you out for the next few transferring from one branch to another in your job looming deadlines and the knowledge that you have to eat healthily and sleep at least hours a night or youre going to get sicketc etc etc many times im happy and i catch myself wondering when the next bad thing is going to happen without fail it does i deal with it successfully and its on to the next one over and over and over again catching moments of pleasure and peace in between its not a very good comparison but its kind of like dark souls where you die your way through instead of playing your way through im slowly being chipped away at ive built an extraordinarily healthy way of living but it seems at this point that its just a tower ive built over a foundation under continuous assault by the elements that im constantly repairing ive been tired so tired its like i died a long time ago and im only i know everybody deals with constant stressors so is everyone secretly feeling this way is it all drowned in alcohol drugs religion are we supposed to naturally numb ourselves with age this cant be all that life is my grandfather eats junk food he stands or sits around for most of the day and sometimes he goes for a walk before coming home and eating hes been through the vietnam war and lost almost everything despite sleep apnea cancer a fatrich diet and falling once hes still thriving in his eighties no one gets to that point unless theyve got it all figured out inside theres something obvious im missing something that appears to make all the difference i dont think a girlfriend will fix this nor will any big purchases or materialism ideally id have a life of inner peace and contentment filled with steady but peaceful determination otherwise life has no meaning to it,0

earlier today i had an eye appointment after what feels like a year and throughout the time i would supposedly have my watch recording so i could listen back to it later on unfortunately just after i was done i found that the thing didnt record anything at all even though i was sure i pressed the record button on it now ive spent the majority of the day stressed out at the fact that i had to rely on my memory to try to replay what my eye doctors informed me of when my minds already on too many things to begin with i mean i know its supposed to be mundane and something to forget about as the days go one not to mention how much my own mother kept in telling me to let such things go and not focus too much on it but ive just started taken a habit of recording important things that went on this week and me not checking to see if my watch was not recording really took a blow on what was supposed to be a good enough day today i mean i had my lucky necklace and everything to signify that being the case its not supposed to be the opposite of that,0
i feel like there is no solution but perhaps someone here can share some insights this is the th year i will be living with my mom i never thought it would be almost a decade she stresses me out like no one else can and that is not only wanting to do every little thing for me but also affording me ver little privacy also i am never ever just relaxing this is probably the reason my shoulders and neck are stiff as a plank my weight doesnt go down always tired always on the verge of tears and a few other minor health issues lets hope they dont become bigger issues i want to move out but finance does not allow it i gym to times a week try to eat healthy sleep hours take a stack of supplements but find no joy in hobbies or socializing mostly because when i get back home she looks at me with doe eyes because why did i go off without her i often play with my budget to see whenif i can move out but so far no luck i am looking into side hustles but the tiredness tears lackluster makes it difficult to focus something must happen now i also dont date for the same reasons as above,0
ok so normally i am a very stressed person like im constantly on edge biting my nails and when i finish biting my nails i bite some of the skin off in the area i never really thought about it too much until i just looked at my hands and i noticed how bad it was so i took a day off to relax and spend the day just making sure to not use my brain too much or do anything particularly stressful like playing a hard videogame or solving a hard puzzle and it was alright but heres the problem now i feel like i cant just go back because every time i try to do something that might need concentration i can feel my heart just going back to that level of stress and i just cant has anyone here been in a situation that can relate to this one if so please tell me what you did,0

i wonder if im the only one sometimes going through all this anyway im a year old male living in los angeles working soon will have my own apartment in a few months because of my autism though most people dont know im autistic i have a roommate currently i am originally from the sf bay area and while i loved it there i needed a change weather for one thing and la just seemed so exciting and it is anyway i moved here in and love it so im happy in the city i live in but im not happy with the circumstances of the last two years and instead of looking back im trying to look forward and realize my lie isnt over and boring and useless first off i used to go the gym and run and eat healthy and i was in much better shape obviously than covid came my work hours changed and so did my diet along with everything else i work retail so those who work it or have will know exactly what im talking about so in i tried to restart by going back to being a vegetarian forcing myself to go back to the gym etc but my motivation is just not there yet i do have a small social life so im thankful for that and i am also a photographer as i love all the architecture in this city but i need more friends my age im guessing and there just seem to be no women who arent partiers or who would let me be myself with them or maybe im looked at as asexual or unattractive anyways i just need something more exciting than just work and home i wish i had a group o could do things with but of course my schedule makes it tough my datingsex history i was never very good at asking women out even though most of my life i was told i was extremely handsome im tall blonde hair brown eyes i was told i could have modeled when i was younger anyway i didnt lose my virginity till i was which is late but partly because i was shy just not confident i had an opportunity to be that girls boyfriend who i lost my virginity to but i just decided i didnt want a relationship with her well between and i had no heterosexual sex but desired it but was insecure etc ill admit because i grew up in san francisco and had gay friends i even experimented with gay men as a way out since i was just not having relationships with women but i realized obviously i was not gay or bi since i didnt feel attracted to men than im i had sex with a drunk cougar and that was one and done i had a disasterous date with a woman in the mission district in sf and it was horrible i than tried going to cougar bars with my friend but of course we would never go home with anyone and it wasnt my scene anyway than in i met my first girlfriend who was older than me at a class funny thing is i liked her immediately and she clearly liked me we saw the batman dark knight movie which was our first date in well we fucked like crazy so much so that i felt it was a bit much and the non sexual side of our relationship seemed kinda ehhh well i eventually drove her away and regretted it and since then ive slept with a few older women from but since covid ive had no sex except masturbation partly i still do struggle with being insecure and feeling like women will never be into me which i know is nonsense of course but i am now have a strange sense of being torn on one hand i would like to be in a relationship on the other hand my life is busy enough with work and exploring stuff in la with my camera i almost feel like the woman would have to be perfect for me because i feel like maybe my earlier history told me something that im just someone who lost their virginity late and because of it maybe it messed me up or maybe im better off just with a few friends and my own life partly i think i need someone who i can be myself around them without judgment and im trying to change maybe im just to weird or absent minded i try to work on my confidence and i try to fake it till i make it but that can only last so long i do have confidence issues and while im secretive about it deep inside i feel like most women are either judging me or think im unattractive or that im gay i guess i need to work on myself i want to get back into shape eat healthier exercise like i used to also i use to shave everyday clean shaven and short hair but when covid came i got lazy im going to try and get myself together and work on myself i take my medication for depression which helps and i do have a therapist but i cant see her as much as id like i do have challenges but i always try to work through them my issues with sex relationships asking women out i have often had issues with asking women out etc its weird maybe i am incel yet i dont blame my problems on women i blame it all on myself that im my own worst enemy i tend to shoot myself in the foot its weird because i dont consider myself repressed i grew up in a liberal household in san francisco i also am not a right winger as most incels are i am liberal anyways so most men can ask a woman out with no problem and nothing would faze them i on the other hand have trouble because i dont want to make a fool of myself come off as creepy etc good example is there is this customer at work who i like and comes in most everyday her and i talk quite a bit when im helping her and we smile at each other and i think she likes me but probably just being friendly two of my colleagues know i like her and always ask have you asked her out yet i always give an excuse or that she wouldnt want to have anything to do with me that way so other guys could just ask a woman out with no issue but not me also im not at my best right now and want to get back to being healthy and exercise the funny thing is i can talk to beautiful women because i do every day because i work in beverly hills and i can engage and be friendly but on my own i dont seek out to talk to women because of my own fear as how they view me the funny thing is i did ask my ex gf out but it wasnt really a date asking her out it was more casual and things developed i just wonder if i can overcome these issues that have been plaguing me for a good chunk of my life i just sometimes feel im cursed h,0

so theres this guy an ex ss officer he fell in love with a jewish prisoner in auschwitz and had a relationship with her after the war he tried to contact her to be with him but she wanted nothing more to do with him so he started a new life family got married he had this one picture ofherin her auschwitz prisoner uniform and he used to cut out her head and put her on another clothing away from auschwitz he used to do this for the most of his life the filmaker says it was a way for him to imagine an alternative life they could have hadhe copied the picture and kept it in his wallet until the day he died so when his daughter was she said her father told her about this jewish girl and that he never ever in his life felt true love like that he even gave his daughter a locket with a picture of him and his ex jewish girlfriend not her mother his daughter said it was odd and she also said that this jewish girl was the love of his lifein a documentary there was a documentary made about them so the filmmaker which is close to both his and jewish girls families said that the ss officer was deeply and truly in love in this jewish girl till the day he died his wife also knew about his exso in he had to go to the court because of his war crimes against humanity and his ex jewish girlfriend was a witnesswhen he saw her after years of no contact he started to cry does that mean even while married to his wife he loved his ex girlfriend more does that mean that he would maybe leave his wife for her,0

or is it just me i have two bloodcirculatory autoimmune disorders that are not that difficult to regulate but can get annoying sometimes because i often have to go to more appointments than id like also depending on the job i may have to ask for accommodations the last manager that i asked for an accommodation basically insinuated that i was lying and even when i proved it with a doctors note she was still very rude about it and acted like i was asking for something ridiculous other than needing to get up every two hours and walk around for five minutes because of my poor circulation i have been let go in the past due to taking time off for medical conditions but of course they dont say that its because of medical condition they just say im taking too much time off so i cant claim ada discrimination ive been at my new job for a little over a year now and they are so flexible and have no issues with me taking time off but of course i built up this wall because of previous jobs and im always terrified to ask for time off when i need to go to a doctors appointment my doctor is like your health is more important than your job and you need to make this work so that you can do everything you need to do to handle your autoimmune diseases obviously my health is more important than a job but he doesnt think about the fact that companies dont give a shit about health and if i lose my job due to taking time off i wont be able to afford insurance or pay outofpocket for him it stresses me the fuck out and i feel like each side is pulling me without considering the consequences,0

while fear shock and disgust are typically seen as negative emotions that we want to avoid they can also be an enjoyable experience in certain situations horror movies are one of the best examples of this when youre watching a horror movie about ghosts zombies serial killers aliens or monsters your nervous system naturally kicks into gear as if youre experiencing a real threat from your environment this fight flight or freezehttpswwwtheemotionmachinecomthecompleteguidetodailystressresponse creates a biochemical rush of adrenaline endorphins and dopamine which can create a type of natural high however while your body experiences the natural high of a real threat your brain knows deep down that youre actually safe and secure and theres no real danger present one early studyhttpslinkspringercomarticlebf published in the journal motivation and emotion looked into why people enjoy eating really spicy foods such as chili peppers and found a similar response chili enjoyers still feel the same irritation and pain of eating spicy foods as everyone else but they enjoy the rush of adrenaline and endorphins it produces it stimulates the bodys warning system in a harmless and riskfree way that can be exciting and exhilarating this type of positive thrillseekinghttpswwwtheemotionmachinecompositivethrillseeking can be found in many other relatively safe and harmless activities such as riding rollercoasters extreme sports skydiving an intense workout or playing competitive video games new psychology research shows that the experience of negative emotions in a safe and controlled context can be very enjoyable and beneficial one studyhttpspubmedncbinlmnihgov published in the scientific journal emotion found that voluntarily arousing negative emotions vane such as purposely making ourselves scared can lead to an overall boost in mood like when we watch a horror movie or visit a haunted house the study looked at individuals who bought tickets for an extreme haunted house event which was designed to elicit a variety of negative emotions such as anxiety fear shock and disgust after the haunted house experience most individuals reported an overall boost in euphoria and positive mood especially if they felt tired bored or stressed beforehand while the sample is biased people who buy tickets to haunted houses are more likely to enjoy them the study does reveal that some people genuinely enjoy scaring themselves furthermore the study found that individuals who enjoyed the haunted house experience also showed less stress while completing subsequent cognitive and emotional tests including showing less reactivity in the brain during those tests as measured by eeg recordings researchers theorize that voluntarily arousing negative emotions vane can teach us how to better deal with future stress and anxiety this is a common technique behind a lot of exposure therapy where a person is gradually put into a fearful situation so they become more desensitized to some irrational fear or phobia for example a person scared of flying may be asked by a therapist to visualize themselves getting on a plane until they learn to manage their fear better by actively exposing ourselves to fear shock or disgust in a safe and controlled way we get to practice regulating these emotions in the moment which is an important pillar of emotional intelligencehttpswwwtheemotionmachinecomfundamentalpillarsofemotionalintelligence horror movies simulate extraordinary experiences that we normally wouldnt have in the real world when we watch a horror movie we put ourselves in the protagonists position and ask ourselves what would i do in this situation new research shows fans of horror movies may even be more prepared to face realworld catastrophes one fascinating studyhttpswwwncbinlmnihgovpmcarticlespmc published in personality and individual differences discovered that fans of horror movies and pandemic movies were more resilient during the covid pandemic it was also found that fans of prepper genres in particular alieninvasion apocalyptic and zombie films exhibited both greater resilience and preparedness this is one reason why pandemic movies such as contagion and days later showed a huge spike in popularity during covid ultimately horror movies give us a chance to face our fears and practice mentally rehearsinghttpswwwtheemotionmachinecommentalrehearsalchanginghabitsthroughthepowerofvisualization how we would respond in extremely intense situations as the famous horror writer stephen king once said a good horror story help us understand our own deepest fears,0

so im currently super stressed and i dont feel like i have anyone to talk to ive suffered with depression for a long time and i recently got a puppy ive wanted another dog for about years and i thought it was a good time to get one now since im wfh the puppy is about months old and at around months she started throwing up i took her to the emergency vet and found out she had an obstruction in her intestines this meant she had to have surgery and her insurance hasnt kicked in so i had to pay out of pocket i had to take out a credit card to pay the k bill she came home and was doing really well then days ago she started throwing up again she threw up around times i took her back to the vet and they had to run a bunch of tests again another k and it seems like a treat i gave her may have irritated her intestines again they wanted to do more tests but i literally can not afford it i spoke to the vet about it as none of this can be covered by insurance the vet gave her an anti nausea medication and sent us home to observe her she ate and hasnt vomited but im still nervous about it all i really got the dog in hopes that it would also help with my depression but its becoming worse due to all of thisi feel helpless and i cant afford to take her back to the vet,0
im years old and i recently enrolled in college i ended up choosing a really hard course my parents were paying for it but i still failed them and i had no choice but to drop the course i went to go drop it today however on the way out i got into a fender bender which will be my second accident this year and im still on my parents insurance im such a colossal fuckup and i dont know what i can do to repair this situation im going to go get a job soon so the finical strain wont be too hard but i just cant believe how much ive ruined my parents trust they placed in me the worst part is its all my fault i just cant believe how easy it is to ruin trust and respect and how hard it is to earn it back i feel paralyzed i cant calm down and this is ontop of the fact that i have anxiety over searching for a job i threw up due to how stressed i was i feel like i cant talk to anyone but strangers about how bad i feel right now i just have no idea how to be ok,0
hi all i thought this would be a good place to ask sometimes its best for my stress and anxiety to flat out block apps and websites that cause me stress i have a very bad habit of wanting to dig things up from the past even if they would hurt me and often times the best way for me to combat this is to restrict myself from accessing social media right now ive been using an app called freedom which has been very useful the issue ive figured out how to disable it whenever i want knowing that at any point i could breach the restrictions i put in place just makes me super anxious im able to go into the vpn settings and turn off connect on demand which allows me to bypass the block does anyone know any surefire way i can block things and not have access to them being able to set a block on social media for hours is often the best way i can get back on track with my day and stop stressing over digging up things that would hurt me is self discipline my only option or is there a better way,0
i f am going through it tonight honestly i couldnt tell if my post belonged in the anxiety or rant subreddit but i asked myself aloud how do i feel and my answer was stressed so here i am crying and bawling my eyes out why you might ask well ill tell you a little bit about mei am an overweight female who has gone through shit in my years of living my childhood was basically robbed of me mainly because i witnessed fights and screaming matches between family members and a near divorce with the parentals i was also bullied majority of my early childhood all the way through middle school after all of this happened and there was a lot more than that i felt like i was forced to grow up and basically chose flight mode to save myself what i mean by that is closing myself off staying in my room and coming out when i absolutely have to i have a fear of being rejected and being a failure i am afraid of being yelled at for doing something wrong and i have a fear of getting into trouble and being reprimanded i still live with my parents and i have no job because of just basically being socially anxious i stutter around people i dont know and that makes me even more anxious and selfconscious i forget things easily and that in turn furthers my fear of being incapable of a job on top of that i have trouble sleeping at night because thoughts run through my head a million times a second because of this i wake up late almost everyday at am just tonight my mom basically dumped a we need to talk case on me and already i felt my blood run cold shes talking to me but all i hear is my heart thumping in my ears she tells me i need to work on waking up early because the rest of the world wakes up early like adults i felt very offended by that and told her that its not my fault that i cant sleep properly at night i in fact tell this to her everyday so its not old news yet when i did remind her of this she basically sighed and almost wanted to roll her eyes then she tells me i need a week to just work on myself to fix that and realistically thats not how that works but i didnt say anything then she tells me i need to find a job something that pays and that of the world gets up and does a to job which i already knew now i was starting think she thinks im lazy or something when its absolutely not the case truth is i have been getting together with my younger sister who is an artist on doing freelance stuff that we are both interested in doing we have been talking about it little by little i told my mom this and she didnt seem to believe me basically looking at me with an expression of ohhh really like what so she asks okay what have yall worked on today of all things she asks on the day me and my younger sister decide to take at least the day off from planning i said well we are taking a break today but i designed some stuff for xx and sended it to her and she reformatted and polished it up my mom seemed to deflate in a way that said that was it not gonna lie it made me feel bad and then she went into a repeated minute lecture on how we need to wake up earlier and start the day like adults meanwhile im here depressed stressed and just over it at this point over the fact that she just doesnt understand at all she says i know you can do it i know that but does she really anytime i do do it she seemes to be unsatisfied and that pushes me a million steps back i get upset and after we finish talking i go to my room to sleep pm at this point and i just start bawling at how useless i felt and the whole why is my life like this it took so much in me not to burst into tears in front of her but man my throat was tighrening so bad it hurt that i couldnt speak for a good few seconds i dont know i guess i just need some advice on the situation anytime im in this position my stress literally goes through the roof and i dont know how to manage it like the need to runaway disappear or worse i really do want to work i want to recieve a paycheck and get my own place and my own car and things but why am i always on flight mode all the time,0

i cant communicate my brain is fried its a little easier writing then speaking im pronouncing words wrong i am mostly communicating with my mom and she is so hard to talk to she cuts you off gets upset if you dont agree and then never understands and so maybe im just so incredibly stressed because my subconscious is already expecting something strainous with communicating with her shes also over communicating like im not getting any continuous space of silence from communication for a good period of time any day of the week which is not her fault but she does keep telling me things that are unnecessary like how she is going to go pick up the dog poop i dont need a play by play of every single minor action i need my brain to function a little better but the forgetting what i am completely saying mid sentence do i have something wrong with my brain or is it stress,0

stress has been linked to all sorts of serious health issues from insomnia to high blood pressure obesity and even heart disease but its generally acknowledged that some stress can also be helpful like when someones chasing a work deadline but what if some level of stress can actually protect the bodyhttpswwwnewswisecomarticleswhatifsomestressactuallyprotectsyourbody a new study by researchers at the case western reserve university school of medicine with findings published sept in proceedings of the national academy of sciences suggests the immune system may benefit from a measure of stress this one of the few studies showing that chronic stress could have beneficial effect instead of negative effect said senior author fabio cominelli professor of medicine and pathology and associate dean for program development at the school of medicine this was a little bit of a surprise for us,0
does anyone know the best ways to relieve stress that arent google search results ie i dont want to hear about exercise eat healthy etc,0
so ive been working now with a team of researchers to understand stress better if you are and live in the us please check this link outhttpstccolumbiaqualtricscomjfeformsvuegpgupsncocfq the study aside it would be need to collect some resources here to cope with anxiety and stress i really liked this cpg grey videhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvsnahsxyockampabchannelcgpgreyo that came out i the pandemic as it relates to mental and physical health,0
im a highschool student i live with my parents not average at math good at science biology is favourite ive got friends ive got supportive family ive never been bullied but the moment i think of school my anxiety and stress touches sky and i feel like i am not capable of anything i feel like the social life or the social media swag is what makes me feel down feeling like im no match for someone yes im stupid af i stress way too much about schoolgoing to school am i looking good enough i compare myself to i dont know what the cool kids nah im pretty friendly with them the backbenchers and class clowns nope theyre all chill with me and always talk with me the big question here is what exactly i stress about and why,0
im already spread thin and stressed to the max my husband is out of town for two weeks for family reasons and i feel overwhelmed with everything we also havent been apart for more than a few days in years the last few says have been especially rough ive been having to drive home in the middle of the day to let our dog out and and give her meds we have opposite schedules so he usually does those things before he goes to work i dont always find parking again when i get back from taking care of her either we adopted another dog right before he left too which i was hesitant to do in just days hes already needed to go to the vet twice once to look at his neuter incision and again later this week for what appears to be allergies or a virus we have another dog whos been with us since before we got married shes undergoing chemo treatment but is doing well i worry about her catching something if hes sick ive been sleeping on the couch the past few nights to keep him apart from her because she sleeps in our bedroom and he doesnt need to be jumping on the bed he also wakes himself and me up multiple times a night because of his stuffy nose on top of all that i ran over a bunch of nails in the road and of course one got into my tire im also struggling with school right now im stressed and frustrated all around my husband left to his dads home country to bury him and spend two weeks with his family there im glad he was able to go but i feel bad that part of me is upset with him about leaving this long i took on all the responsibilities we share plus extra so he could go he hasnt even been gone a week yet i dont know how im going to keep everything up until he gets back my stress management techniques are poor other than sleeping theres nothing that helps me alleviate stress,0
im an highly stressed person and when i have a hard week i tend to tell myself im not good enough and that i should do things quicker drink at least once in week do unhealthy behavior when drunk then regretting it im drinking enough to lose sight of space and time for two hours im healthy im only eating meals that i cook with non transformated ingredients and im fit i run and i go to the gym times week i love school and what i do but theres a lot of pressure because we have classes even on saturday i cant really talk to anyone about this i tried mditation for a month but while i was on vacation so it was easier and i wont talk about it to my family because when i had anxiety attack my dad didnt take me seriously and said i was crybaby and i was overly dramatic my mother has zero reaction or find way to talk about herself to say in more subtile way im crybaby and that she had it harder than me do you have any recommandation i wont try again positive affirmations because it didnt work in the past,0
im not dieting but my weight is dropping drastically i feel like im maxed out my eye is twitching i feel like i could puke at any second im so stressed,0
i hope im not on the wrong subreddit for this question kind of talking about like the quote what doesnt kill you makes you stronger or something like that im not sure but i feel like i dont cope with stress too well i can manage to study for long hours without tears or anything but that is in the past i feel like these days im feeling the pressure i have a feeling that if i fail a question or something like that i just start to contemplate my life even after the exam even like i would get on the verge of tears if i didnt know something like if i fail the exam i dont have good grades then i dont go to a good university then i dont get a job or either i get a job with little pay people make fun of me etc honestly makes me feel anxious but even if i have coping techniques sometimes i still really wish i could just put myself into extremely stressful environments but not like lifethreatening events i just want to put myself under immense crippling stress when i do everyday basic things like practicing an exam paper or cleaning within a time limit sometimes i feel that its necessary for me to just stress myself out then after that ill develop a good stress tolerance or something like that i just really wished i were one of those people who are extremely good at managing stress and never shed a tear in a very long time and i mean years to be honest i know its sounds like im really selfsabotaging but no matter how much i really want to pressure myself to the extremes i have a feeling it probably isnt right for me but then again theres people around me especially on the internet who study for hours or work for many hours and probably do well under pressure just hope someone would answer this question for me,0

im in a city where most of my family resides but im homeless because id rather be alone than be around negative people its been a few months since i chose this path and ive been strong the entire way through it until now just got out of a short relationship that was bit toxic for my taste she was basing our relationship off of shall we say physical aspects i just found out on top of that she was fucking her ex while weve been talking and just yesterday she told me that she believes she may be pregnant by her ex but its too early to take a pregnancy test so i acted normal let the conversation flow as it would over the phone until we finished and i could not stop thinking about what she had just told me next day i told her we should brake up we did she blamed everything on me i kept my cool explained how i felt i was ignored so i created distance so i could heal but ive come to the conclusion that i dont want to heal i just want this to end ive never been more ready to end my life until today not because of the break up but because of everything the condition of the world our future the situation with my family not being able to find and get a place of my own and stuck in a city i absolutely hate ive been strong but now i just dont give a fuck i thought life was meant to be worth living,0

hey joined this community just now since i kinda need some life advice from anyone ive always been stressing out a lot over various things but as of recently i started to realise that it has taken over my life in various ways for example even as of recently i was supposed to drive a group of friends to a theme park just a fun day but the responsibility of driving my friends there somehow made me insanely nervous even though i was calm inside if that makes sense as a result i slept hours in total melatonin didnt work meditating did nothing breathing exercises did nothing my mind just kept on racing ps a friend drove in my car for me im not driving on hrs of sleep its not just that single event though school days cause stress tests cause stress even having a totally free day but having to receive a package the next day causes sleep issues and stomach aches when doing things im always thinking about the worst thing that could happen and what if that would happen even if the chances are minimal which only adds up to the stress idk anymore should i visit a psychiatrist like what do you do here this has been ongoing for at least years now im currently and this has to stop thnx,0
the more weeks go by the more helpless i feel about this course i hate the professor i hate the lab partners i hate the tas i hate the activities and homework we have to do and i hate physics the most i never had a sturdy foundation in physics anyways the only reason i managed with physics in high school was because i memorized most of the solutions and most of the problems were similar to the other problems i practiced besides my tutor was good at helping me learn im doing an introductory physics course this semester and i feel so absolutely dumb were supposed to work in groups to complete activities and every week we are given a set of problems for homework the professor adds a set of puzzles at the end of every assignment to supposedly promote logical thinking and spatial reasoning or whatever the thing is i never really liked physics in the first place but not i hate it the labs are for two hours i cant understand a single concept and the people in my group are so snide and rude about the fact that they understand the class and i cant i remember asking for help about a homework problem to them on discord and i would have been grateful if they had given me a few hints about how they solved that problem but all they did was send the wrong answers and made a bunch of memes about how they trolled me one of the guys is so arrogant about how he took ap physics and he knows all of the concepts and is so good at physics meanwhile i cant even do a single problem independently the professor also gives a bunch of puzzles like kenkens or spatial reasoning problems that im too dumb to do and im doing the worst in that class its just too much for me aside from that course im in computer science and while my other classes arent as awful theyre also pretty difficult plus i have work study and most of my work hours coincide with the office hours i still have to take the course as a requirement and i feel like im going to fail i get panic attacks every night thinking about it and i cant deal with it anymore,0
canadian college student btw i used to be the complete opposite i would do assignments a couple days before it was due and have zero stress however recently im getting assignments done weeks ahead of time which im proud of tbh im taking my education more seriously and its like a need to get it done with better quality thus making more time for myself and picking up extra shifts at my retail job but now its just getting ridiculous were not even in week and im stressing about getting an assignment done on time for week i literally cannot fall asleep some nights because im thinking too much about it how tf do i deal with this how do i convince myself that itll get done and it doesnt have to be done right in this moment,0
our lives are in turmoil due to many factors but lately my husbands concussion and brain injury issues have completely put a stretch on our stress limits im not sure where to go or what to do hes very upset over his situation and feels like i dont understand which of course i do not understand it completely but i have a different set of stressors related to this situation the problem is that our lives had a lot of stress prior to his injury so its just too much i try not to let on how stressed i am because he obviously is in a worse state that me he wont talk about things much and when i try to help him he says im making it worse and smothering him he feels that because i have a background working with people with developmental issues i should just know what to do for him but it is way different when its your husband versus a client i just need to help alleviate some stressors in our life where do i start,0

hello i am a yearold man with good health i have been suffering from an increase in urination of dilute urine especially in the early morning i did all the tests for blood tests for hormones liver kidneys and heart such as radiographs and blood tests but the internal doctors and nephrologists and endocrine did not find any problems i have including diabetes as the cumulative and daily blood sugar levels are very excellent could the cause be anxiety or excessive stress cause this has any of you experienced something similar,0
ive been posting my journey for the last years as these symptoms came on abruptly and to this day have never left the symptoms are as follows head pressure mainly in the top back of my head insanely dry eyes especially when looking at screens nothing has helped feels like my head is spasming and my eyes are shaking absolutely nothing resolves this completely ever however i notice when i dont focus on them and im occupied i dont really necessarily notice the symptoms if im not occupied the symptoms feel much more apparent and worse i did use klonapin for a year so maybe the dry eye or some of these shakes are side effects of stopping that a few months ago but the head pressure existed even before i started the klonapin does anyone have the same or similar symptoms i feel its ridiculous to just have to live with this and ive read enough that theres a ton of people experiencing this so maybe we can all share what helps to resolve this altogether thanks guys,0

i thought i need to hustle my way to success but what i learned next changed my life forever the hustle culture is pretty toxic i was being told that working hours a day constantly chasing after the next task and being totally drained afterwards not even able to enjoy a dinner with my family is the way to success and believe me ive done that for way too long after quitting my job and deciding to start my first coaching business i basically switched from working hours a day days a week to hours a day days a week finally quit the rat race huh quite frankly it felt like less pressure than doing the typical at the beginning because i was really excited to work on my dream as the months passed i was getting deeper and deeper into the grind it got to a point where i would wake up at am already thinking about work then work through the whole day and still be replying to my clients messages at am lying in bed with my girlfriend my mind was constantly there at work at the dinner table during a walk with my partner even when skiing on vacation that i rarely took back then i was constantly experiencing this weird sense of guilt when i wasnt productive and even though my business was growing so was my anxiety stress and lack of satisfaction with life it eventually led to me getting sick so badly that it was a struggle to even reply to a clients message i was stressed out of my mind it felt like everything is going to collapse on me if i keep going down that route finally i decided to take a real break i took a full days off and decided to delete all the apps like slack messenger and gmail from my phone which sounded absolutely crazy to me back then but man it felt liberating something clicked inside me and finally i was able to let go of all the pressure and stress that were haunting me for the first time in months i experienced this deep sense of relief and inner peace by stepping out of this craziness i was able to notice how toxic and unhealthy it was how having healthy boundaries and balance in your life is key to actually enjoying what youre doing and what youre working so hard for now i truly believe that me getting crazy sick back then was one of the best things that could have happened to me it led to me finally re owning the enjoyment of my everyday life plus my business started rapidly growing as a result of me allocating my time more effectively and creating more value in less time it made me realize that much of the hustle i was doing was just me spinning my wheels on things that werent really making the boat go faster now i know for sure that the best way to achieve better results is to master both the work and the relaxation to plan the life in such a way that your wealth health and relationships are in perfect balance please dont waste your life thinking that theres some pride in being overstressed overworked and overwhelmed,0
hi there so this playlist available at both apple music and spotify came to life almost a year ago when id finished researching the effects of listening to nature sounds easily explainedyou may have heard about our inherited fightorflight response system which is a major factor in stress and anxiety well research has shown that listening to nature sounds triggers the opposite system called restordigest which helps lowering your heart rate ease tightening muscles and enable you to focus on fewer things these system is just like our fof response is inherited from our ancestors we believe that reason behind nature sounds triggering this is that hearing birds rain etc meant positive things for the caveman generations birds singing meant that there were no large predators around as well as good soil rain meant crops would grow fire that they would survive the night and so on hope this helps everyone it reaches link to playlist spotify and applehttpslinktreeindigoease,0

hi m lbs here the last two days ive been pretty stressed out with work and started noticing that to the left of my left eye little close to the side forehead ive been getting this awful pinching feeling that comes and goes i drink some caffeine during the day but today decided to lay off of it and its still coming in waves the best i can describe it as a pinching vain i started worrying that it might be a stroke or aneurysm but quickly chalked that up to just being anxiety ive been feeling a little foggy minded too so i wonder if that has come to play too yesterday night i drank a few beers and it seemed to help but then came back when i was sober i take an antidepressant and ritalin daily but have been on them for years so i really dont think thats the case does anyone else get this headache feeling if so remedies or should i go see a doctor thanks,0

everyone wants less stress and that is why in this post i will talk about daily habits for a less stressful life i myself apply these habits every day in my life so everything i talk about comes from my own experience once you apply the methods in this post regularly they will eventually become habits at first it may be difficult to apply these methods because it may all feel a little strange but once you experience the positive effects you will find enough motivation to continue why you need to create daily habits for a less stressful life most people do a lot in a day and that can be incredibly wonderful but it can also cause a lot of stress and stress is not always bad for you it can sometimes help you get the best out of yourself but longterm stress can be very bad for your health for example it can cause your immune system to deteriorate making you more likely to get sick but it can also cause you to become irritable and your mood to deteriorate ultimately it can also cause you to have almost no energy or motivation left to do things in addition to the aforementioned consequences of longterm stress there are many more consequences that you dont want to have either and to reduce the risk of these consequences it can be helpful to create habits for a less stressful life focus on your breathing for a less stressful life sometimes people get a lot of stress because they get lost in thoughts to prevent you from overthinking and getting stressed it is useful to sometimes focus on your breathing for example if you are busy working or studying remind yourself to focus on your breathing once every minutes you dont have to breathe differently just let your breathing flow naturally but focus on it for a moment feel the air go in and out meditation is one of the daily habits for a less stressful life meditation can help you unwind completely you can meditate by sitting down and focusing on your breathing as guidance you can say to yourself in when you inhale and out when you exhale then as your breathing gets deeper and slower you can say deep and slow to yourself make a daily habit of going outside for a less stressful life the environment you are in can affect how much stress you experience suppose you are in an environment where you are constantly receiving signals that cause stress such as phone calls emails or other things that remind you of stressful situations then it can be useful to get away from this situation for a while and preferably it can be useful to go to a park forest lake or sea because in these environments there is often a lot of space and there are few or no things that cause stress walk mindfully and when youre walking pay attention to your footsteps and your breathing inhale and take for example three steps and then when you exhale take another three steps also feel how your feet touch the ground this mindful way of walking gets you out of your head and into the moment go exercise and feel the stress disappear being physically active is incredibly important but its also incredibly helpful to exercise if you want to release stress i myself really feel the stress disappear when i exercise and if ive trained really hard im sometimes so tired that i dont even feel like stressing about anything anymore haha you dont necessarily have to train super hard the stress can also disappear during an easy workout or go for a jog while listening to your favorite music and feel the stress disappear help your friends and family i wish you much success in applying these methods for a less stressful life hopefully you can apply them so often that they become habits in your daily life but i do want to ask you one more thing i suspect that you have friends and family who also sometimes suffer from longterm stress you can help these friends and family by sending them this post and maybe you can start creating these habits together which will make it a lot easier for both of you because working together on something ensures that you motivate each other originally from this blog posthttpsquintenvanommencomdailyhabitsforalessstressfullife,0

ive been undergoing a lot of stress as of late from some new developments in my life and that has led me to lashing out at people both friends and family who are either trying to help or just engage in conversation ive always been a pretty social guy introverted but i like going out to see people and i get invited to random functions from time to time so i take it as a sign that at least some people like my company lol its just that when im under intense duress like i am now my immediate instinct is to take as much control as possible and that can make me agitated and forget that the person im talking tointeracting with might not appreciate that im coming on strong ive never had anger issues i dont get violent i just get pretty mean and thats an ugly part of me that i dont like i feel like ive already pushed some people away i would just like to talk about some coping strategies that could help i already exercise and read often work full time and dont really have any responsibilities outside of that if im being honest i dont know sorry for a rambly post ive never really opened up about personal and touchy feelings like this and even if i dont get real advice then just putting it into words will help solidify the problem for me,0

some couples get pregnant easily while some do not despite trying for a long time there could be multiple factors contributing to difficulty conceiving but of all of them stress plays a significant role stress does not directly cause infertility however it does impact the chances of conception by delaying it infertility has become very common now and the factors contributing to it are multiple ranging from physical causes and dietary changes to even excessive use of gadgets there is enough research to prove that stress can adversely affect a couples chances of conception naturally or through medical procedures like ivf so what is the relationship between stress and infertility the science behind stress and infertility when we are stressed our brains release cortisol a stress hormone that interferes with the signals between the brain and the ovaries thus disrupting the ovarian cycle and the release of the ovarian eggs in the case of men sperm production and motility are impacted apart from the bodys response stress contributes to behavior and mood changes too there is a decrease in the desire and motivation to have sex there is an increase in smoking or drinking alcohol in order to cope with stress which in turn causes trouble with conceiving understand the vicious cycle stress and conception are highly connected most often couples who are trying to conceive become dejected when it takes a longer time some find the medical procedures involved in the process to be taxing for example most couples going through ivf procedures are often stressed out this in turn affects the biology and behavior of the couple thereby creating a vicious cycle stress management is thus necessary in order to break free from this cycle which in turn would help a couple conceive managing stress some amount of stress is normal however if one is continuously anxious and hassled by circumstances around them it will deeply impact conception learn morehttpswwwcadabamshospitalscomtherelationshipbetweenstressandinfertility,0

i dont want to grow up the thought of becoming an adult is overwhelming the cost of living has risen so much do you seriously expect me to be able to fund myself a home and bills with minimum wage the pressure of needing to do well academically is stressful i know im smart but in regards to how smart i am in comparison to others my age i feel i am nothing im strong minded and driven but im not inherently a genius nor do i have the skill set of one i lack versatility perseverance and self discipline i give up easy and lose hope upon the slightest bit of failure i do not have a large skill set and therefore rely too much of my strengths compromising and over performing to make up for my inability to do well at other skills deep down i know the persistence to attend university is understandable but ultimately what does it leave me with debt stress no guaranteed jobsalary to match my years of education i genuinely worry i will become a useless adult i have no doubt theres far more capable people than me who have more potential who would be a better fit into society im currently young and beautiful but that will only get me so far even now i have overwhelming waves of sadness that make me feel sick to my stomach i cant imagine how ill deal with that as an adult i indulge in self pity too much which in turns only makes me feel more pity for myself as it makes me hyper aware of my existence and how lost i am though i am beautiful i feel that can only get me so far my intellect feels inferior than those around me and i feel as if the best i will ever amount to is mediocrity though im not an adult yet im already theorising what to do with my life if i fail at becoming an one edit for people asking f i have a job but its just fast food im strongest in fields such as the humanities in particularly history and politics literature visual arts and textiles however my weaknesses are maths my head struggles to grasp anything thats not basic math and most sciences however i am passing my psychology class which i like,0
hi i dont know if its the right place to post this but lately i have been figuring out the features of a lifelong problem of mine i would call it the simple inability to manage stress but i want to be more specific and im curious if other people can feel the same based on how i describe it i would describe the relation between me and stress in this way the incapacity to accept stress and everyday fatigue as a normal part of life referred also to very simple tasks the forced splitting between bad days and good days where in the bad days im not allowed to feel good because of some stressful tasks to do that basically ruin the whole day while in the good days im not allowed to feel stressed because im not supposed to feel so and im not meant to do some extra stuff that would cause some fatigue it also ends up in hating the ending of a good day becuase tomorrow is gonna be a bad day you know when sunday is ending and monday is the next day or also when youre coming back from a vacation basically the inability of enjoying the moment because my mind is always projected in the future rejection of the idea of facing new stressful situations this becomes particulary strong whenever i just came through some stressful stuff my mind sells to me a higher level of stress toleranceperformance in a particular moment with the promise that im not going to face new similar situations in the future i use to motivate myself during difficult moments with the thought that afler that everything is over im going to rest and its gonna be a good time but this also tricks my mind into thinking that there are not going to be similar stressful situations in the future overall which obviously cant be true the high expectation before a supposed good day or good time is about to come as if its going to be a super regenerating moment for me that will restore all my power of will this is not rational and not realistic most of the times because everyone would never get enough of a good time and unpleasant things can happen during a planned good time as well feeling envious towards people who are not going through a stressful moment while i am focusing almost in an obsessive way on other people around me who are chilled and are not facing anything difficult in those moments i forget that everyone has stressful moments just not at the same time i am the free person when other are facing hard moments the excessive anxiety and discomfort before a task that i know its going to be stressful also an easy one as if my mind was trying to convince me that im never supposed to be stressed and thats not normal for me doing stuff that i dont like even if theyre necessary,0

this is a vent to help myself destress lol for the past years that i have lived in my current city i have unfortunately moved from one lousy situation into the next due to thinking it was a good idea to move in with friends to help out my crummy finances and needing cheaper rent for the past almost years due to the pandemic and other situations i moved into a rooming type housing situation which for the past and a years me and my dog did have full use of a basement to ourselves last july my company announced that they would be laying off around people myself included what my stupid company didnt bank on was supply chain issues with getting key integral parts to operate equipment so they kept delaying our end of work date for the past months when i found out that i was to be laid off a year ago this july i stupidly told the lady i rented my basement from about the news but seeing how at the time my company didnt announce when our actual end date would be due to supply chain issues she took it upon herself and guessed that my end date would be around may of this year and i will have been moved out so she went ahead and rented the basement out to a family of three this was a major jerk move on her part seeing how i am really strapped for cash and couldnt afford to get another apartment for me and my dog with not knowing when i would actually be moving out she offered for me to move into her sunroom this past may until my end date and she she would move her mattress into her living room to sleep in my company finally announced that our end of work date would be at the end august this past may and i unfortunately have to stay on working and living where i am due to those reasons seeing how this past year has been touch and go with not knowing when my company would announce this end of work date and with not knowing when this opposed announcement would be happening i thought it would be stupid to move somewhere else and have to sign a lease for however long so seeing how i live month to month here i chose to stay since moving into her sunroom it has been a friken nightmare she consistently picks on me and flat out accuses me of doing things that i havent done i am not allowed to flush the toilet unless its brown she accused me of killing her precious plant i have to keep the sunroom door shut during the day so that the heat doesnt come through the whole housefriken stupid stuff like that she has gotten a bit too overly attached to my dog as well and drops stubble hints about how happy my dog is living here my dog and i will be relocating to another province to attend school so i can upgrade my current skills at the end of august just this past wednesday my friend got word that she has to go work out of town this week so she offered for me and my dog to go and stay at her place to get away from the madness here and also mind her cat when i told the lady this she mentioned how this wouldnt be a good idea and how it would disrupt my dogs routine with living here and how it is probably super hot at my friends apartment meanwhile she has no air conditioning here the first night there wasnt so good because my dog was in unfamiliar area and she was all nervous and panting a lot my dog has done this many times before when camping or going away for a holidayso i got her some calming spray to see if that would help my dog and i came back to the house last night because i have my car scheduled for servicing and a garage which is literally minutes away from the house so instead of staying at my friends apartment we came back here to sleep last night for getting to the garage would be way easier in the morning when we arrived back last night the lady in question was like ohhh she is so happy to be back of course she would she is in familiar surroundingshowever seeing how well be moving at the end of august and staying in hotels over night and other friends placesstaying at my friends apartment is a good trial run when i mentioned that to the ladyshe munched up her face as if to say ohi dont like the sounds of this so i am at the point with waiting for her to literally say to me why dont you just leave your dog with me and that is when i will snap thanks to all who read my vent,0

this is going to be super long but i would really appreciate someone out there taking the time to read it ive been working a relatively stressful job for the last four years the stress was manageable until about a year ago when i was given the responsibility of managing a global team of systems administrators in the us hungary and india that all work to give coverage to my company i cant go into specifics of our work but i can say that we are an extremely important team there are a lot of reasons behind why i have become increasingly stressed out the main one being that i have personally been the only point of failure for the whole thing for almost the entire year i cant take a day off or sometimes even an hour off without someone from like time zones away trying to escalate something to me or my boss of they cant reach me directly before this past week i had taken one scheduled day off and i still got a call from my boss asking to get people online for an outage let me say my boss is amazing she is the best example of leadership ive ever had in any job and ive worked it for like years she just has a very demanding job role also and i am in a spot where im kind of working different full time job roles and one of those job roles requires that i get people online for outages which are not at all related to the global team im responsible for the past few months people have increasingly seen that im getting more and more stressed to the point where i had a chat with hr because i had started working like hour weeks sometimes until am i basically said that because of how ive been forced to set this whole team up within the guidelines im given by upper management not my direct boss nobody else has time to work this project so if i dont do the work myself it cant get done i mean everyone saw it coming including me then last week happened i was supposed to have friday off as a normal day because leadership rotates sundays for the other full time job role apart from the project so every time i work a sunday i get the following friday off we had a major issue happen on thursday which we knew would carry into this coming weekend so i was going to cancel both my friday off and the planned time i had on the calendar for like three months from wednesday sunday this week because i knew everything would get messed up if i didnt well i decided this was a chance for me to test if other parts of leadership can actually do their jobs instead of canceling my time off like i have literally every other time something like this has happened the last year i decided to take it however i gave my peers the plan of what needed to happen from friday sunday laid out for them completely and all but spoonfed them i went into it trying to just expect people to do their jobs all they had to do was say ok we have the plan heres this person who can do this thing that needs to get done ill have them do it i also knew it wasnt going to happen like that i knew i knew that come sunday evening nothing would get done so i went friday without checking my work phone i went saturday without checking my work phone then sunday rolled around and i finally checked sure enough even though my peers had the plan it wasnt executed i had to log in on sunday to quickly get the right weekend people on it and because things werent executed on time during fridaysaturday like i said they needed to be it caused two huge outages like twelve time zones away i went into work on monday morning completely distraught i met with my directs under me basically telling them that what happened is not their fault and an effect of ineffective leadership which im largely responsible for i sat there for a good minutes apologizing to them telling them what i plan to do going forward and also commiserating because i was really as stressed as they were about it during that talk something broke in me i think like i had known that i was the sole failure point globally but i was fine with that as long as i had people who could simply just organize whatever plan i gave them i gave them that plan on thursday trying to clear things off my plate as i have been advised to do by my boss and hr just expecting them to do basically the bare minimum and they werent capable of executing i finally actually felt the full weight of being the sole failure point of global operations and it crushed down on me so hard that i could barely breathe i went to my boss after that meeting and told her i had to leave for the day but i would be back the next day i took monday off almost too full of anxiety to even drive home but made it then just watched movies id seen a hundred times already all day because i couldnt process any new information i felt alright though like at the end of it i had a sense of purpose and renewed motivation i woke up tuesday completely ready to rock it at work but as soon as i pulled out of the parking lot i started to get a feeling ive only ever felt once before i hopped on the highway and the closer i got to work the more i felt it then it happened i had a panic attack i had to pull off the highway to turn around to go home the second i had my car going back the other way i felt like i could breathe even though i was still having heart palpitations tunnel vision numb tongue etc i got home called my boss and was straight up with her stating i had a panic attack on my way in and i would not be making it then came yesterday i had to make a five hour drive back to my hometown for the plans i had made for the aforementioned scheduled time off i was happy looking forward to it couldnt wait to get back but as soon as i got on the highway the dread set in the obsessive thoughts set in i spent the next five hours in panic attack mode to the point where i dont know how i actually drove the car all i wanted to do was get home so i kept going but i stopped like six times to recenter myself on a trip that i dont generally even stop on once i got here took a breath sat down for a bit and things were okay but ever since its been a mixed bag of being okay for a while then like minutes of panic attack then being okay again then another panic attack thankfully i spent today playing golf with my family which is what i had been looking so forward to but it took like an hour for me to come into reality when we first started out then i got back took a nap and woke up in a panic attack about an hour later like this is not at all my natural state i am normally a very chill person who handles stress immensely well i have had one panic attack before during a very difficult time but ive never had multiples of them and ive most certainly never had a nervous breakdown but i think thats where i am ive tried talking to my family but none of them really understand because none of them has ever really had this kind of breakdown general depression anxiety and that stuff so they can relate haha family can relate on that level but its like i can barely be a functioning human thats what they cant relate with thats why i decided to post here hoping that someone else can relate and just let me know this is going to end at some point im not suicidal or anything ill suffer through whatever i have to suffer though i just need to have a light at the end of the tunnel have you ever seen seen you know that part where they find the guy kevin spacey had been keeping alive for a year and the doctor said if i were to shine a light in his eyes right now hed die of the stress thats where i feel like i am like any source of any stress from anywhere that raises my adrenaline whatsoever just throws me into a panic attack i am trying to deal but its difficult feeling like theres no end in sight because ive never experienced this before so i dont know what to expect if you made it this far thank you for reading my novel i really super appreciate it and owe you cookies possibly also milk but milk probably doesnt travel too well in the mail,0

i will explain why being outside is good for your health nowadays we are often indoors almost all day because of school and work theres not always something wrong with that but youll probably feel a lot better if you go outside every now and then it makes the mind clearer inside a house study or workplace there are often many things that make you think about your work or study there is nothing wrong with this but it can ensure that you are constantly busy with your work or study this may keep you thinking and living in your head instead of in the moment in addition there are all kinds of other distractions indoors that keep your mind from calming down so go outside and enjoy the tranquility less stress this tranquility automatically reduces stress you are not busy with school your work or other things as a result you go out of your head and into the moment this will also reduce your stress and reduce the risk of stress symptoms and complaints in addition physical exercise is also a great way to reduce stress when you are physically active you can reduce stress you probably also feel that when you exercise and after you exercise you notice that your stress is reduced compared to before you started exercising originally from this blog posthttpsquintenvanommencomwhybeingoutsideisgoodforyourhealth,0
i f have a few things that just seem off to me i have a job that i hate its my first job its a in a high pace high stress environment and when i make a mistake it has an effect and of course i do make mistakes my coworker also treats me like a personal assistant and delegates all of her last minute jobs to do immediately without thanks which is so stressful as i can never complete a project on time because of it enough backstory though this isnt a life advice sub i just need to rant about the things i think are caused by stress ive always looked young for my age i take good care of my skin using retinol and spf every day yet my skin is ageing i turned a month ago so this is weird i look heavier than i am i get a lot of exercise k steps minimum daily plus cardio focussed gym times a week depending how tired i am and do not over eat if anything tw i probably under eat by a long way because i lose my appetite and forget to eat its just bizarre to me and its not that i want to be thinner but i know that with my lifestyle i ought to be a lot thinner than i am so ive no clue what the reasoning for that is my psoriasis is getting worse it used to be a small patch on my leg but now ive got it on my lips cheeks back and its spreading down my arm i was researching self soothing and i do that obsessively i bite my lips to oblivion and crack my knuckles to the point where they hurt i am always tired even if i get hours of sleep luckily my insomnia has gone away for the time being but that used to be really bad too i also get migraines the second i begin to relax if its not pretty obvious ill just throw in that i have been diagnosed with anxiety my doctor doesnt want to help and theres no free therapy in my area as theres massive wait lists for everything so im on here hoping to find someone who might relate can this all be due to stress do you have any advice my job contract ends soon and im not renewing it dont worry but i know any entry level job will be just as intense so how can i manage it and minimise these symptoms my family doesnt seem to care and just say its life but im going to spiral if i cant control it,0

this happened last friday i have always had an anxiety disorder and it has been worse with all the stress i have been under lately both at work as well as at home i work for gm which everyone who dont work there knows as a good job but in reality it has gone to shit i was hired years ago and was in the last group to get traditional pay benefits and a retirement plan so i cant find anything else that pays the same anyone hired after me is really fucked and there is a reason gm cant keep any of the new employees i work in material handling and the company is working up towards outsourcing and cutting those jobs so they are cutting out full teams and overloading everyone thats left then telling us everythings going to change soon just make it work for the next year i have some serious stuff going on at home that i dont want to get into and it just makes the work stress that much worse on friday i messed up i knew i messed up and wasnt mad about getting written up or anything but the thing is i spend of my waking life and my first ever anxiety attack was while i was asleep i woke up thinking i was having a heart attack so probably my sleeping life also feeling like something terrible is going to happen due to my anxiety when i get in trouble it felt like the end of the world i took my break and paced around outside debating if i should call in my fmla and leave work but when i came back something very small and stupid happened that set me off i blew up on my group leader screaming at her that i cant fucking do this even though i hate gm she is the nicest lady and easily the best boss i have ever had and i feel like a complete scumbag she tried to fire me and the union got it down to a suspension but i honestly couldnt feel worse if i had been fired im so ashamed of myself for how i acted and have been in a deep depression for the last few days and havent done much more than lay in bed crying the worst part is that she thinks i did it because i was mad about the write up and thought i could bully her because she is a woman and week apparently she has faced discrimination in previous jobs i hate myself im ashamed of myself and even though i didnt get fired i feel like nothing will ever be ok again,0

part of me feels like this is a silly thing to be stressed about but the effect it has on me is very real and makes me feel terrible ive been a gamer for years when i was a kid we had much less to choose from so playing the same videogame over and over wasnt a problem these days we have tens of thousands to choose from and i own well over of them this is my only major hobby by the way which is a problem in and of itself i used to wake up and immediately starting playing something to keep away the feeling of dread in my life because i suffer from depression and anxiety games have been my only escape from that nightmare for many years im finding now that i cant seem to find interest in them anymore i have hundreds of games ive not even completed and i want to finish them but the motivation just isnt there i will seriously stress myself out flipping through all of what i own trying to find one that catches my attention and nothing ever sticks out i never had this issue years ago but now ill juat gwt frustrated panic and sit at home on my day off doing nothing because my one hobby seems useless to me now i dont even know how to engage in other activities because ive been on the same pattern for so long i really juat want to be able to focus and enjoy gaming again this all sounds seriously dumb when i wrote it down i almost dont want to post this because it feels that stupid but it genuinely makes me miserable all i do is work and sit at home being bored and boredom is literally killing me without the motivation to engage in activities i become consumed by stress and depression what can i do to find the motivation again im going to go in circles until i die,0

hello there i am very tired of having people not be interested in what i have to say my whole family is just so annoying for example today i was trying to talk about something really important to me with my mother it meant a lot to me because i dont normally open up my mother after hearing this went mm okay and then went on her phone we were in the car so i held back tears the entire drive home and when i finally got to my room and cried my eyes out this has happened a lot as my mother is not a very emotional person whenever i open up i think that maybe she will react nicely but this one was the last straw the fact that she couldnt even say anything back to me about this thing was appalling and it broke my heart another person who is frustrating is my brother i could listen to him talk about video games for four hours straight and have a great conversation but the moment i mention something i want to talk about he goes on his phone and ignores me dont get me wrong he is way better than my mother but still really disappointing i have always been taught to hold it in and never speak about my feelings and it really sucks i really want goo friends where they dont mind that i am not very expressive or they will listen when i am stressed and will let me cry on their shoulder and vise versa i wanna be able to talk about stuff that i enjoy and people actually be interested in what i have to say anyways i am never going to talk about anything with my family ever again and one day i will have a real family see ya,0
recently ive been thinking about over indulging on digital devices podcasts entertainment emails texts even music when do our minds get a break from the constant overload on information i have found that when i put everything away and just have silence my thoughts are a lot better and i feel more in control this is something i want to implement into my coaching getting away from digital distraction,0
its not unusual for a person to think theyre doing worse than they actually are some of us are pessimistic others have limiting beliefs lurking im not good enough im not worthy progress is just luck setbacks reenforce limiting beliefs consider these positive signs you reflect on and learn from setbacks and errors you arrive at a balanced view of these and develop clear plans to learn and continue growing people often repeat the same errors over and over whether its overspending or choosing a partner people have a strong tendency to repeat their behaviours but you can choose to respond differently and achieve different outcomes youre clear on what you want and why knowing what you want is the second key step in getting it knowing who and what you are is the first knowing what you want differentiates you from those who aimlessly floating through life you use time wisely we all have hours each week and the choice on how to use them you focus on what is important within the context of who you are and what you have chosen to achieve you have the habit of asking yourself what is the most effective thing you could be doing right now youre making consistent progress consistent progress is a great sign even when your goals feel far in the distance regular progress driven by consistent effort and learning will get you there as well as planning what more needs to be done reflect on how far you have already come youre not alone there are many people are alone in the world if youre not alone youre doing better than many others youre committed you know who you are and what youre about your goals are clear they create meaning for you value for others and legacy for the future great things happen when your purpose and your environment align you consider others opinions you learn what is resourceful to you and discard what isnt you live your life not theirs you are grateful you regularly reflect on what has gone well and crucially on why it has gone well you have skills and strengths you dont even realise youre authentic you know you values and beliefs you make your decisions and take your actions consistent with these when youre clear on what you have chosen to accomplish and youre spending your time wisely youre doing well and better than most this is true even if the results have yet to reveal themselves genuine desire effective strategy consistent persistence authentic results,0
i work hours a week at a clinicremotely am a parttime online mph student and am also working on several projects on the side i feel like i have no time to pursue hobbies i once loved doing learning new languages playing the piano cooking and baking by the time im done with work all i want to do is watch tv and hang out with my pets i have only hours at the end of the day even socializing feels exhausting these days and ive been rather isolated i have been recovering from surgeries this year major ones and i have still managed to stay busy has anyone else felt this way i feel like im a rather boring person lately but i just am so drained ampxb,0

what i mean is for example i have these goals find a good job or start and grow a succesful company find the one who will marry me in the future find out which religion is the true one read the whole bible so my idea is i will only work towards one goal at the same time if i choose goal and i choose to study or gain work experience then i will not read the bible and i will not be on dating apps because i should not overwhelm myself and risk a burnout if i choose goal i will be very busy with dating apps and alternatives but i will not have a job and i will not be studying if i choose i will read the bible a few hours every day but i will not do any other productive things what is the good side of this by my own thought whichever goal is the most important one or has to be completed the fastest can get priority and full focus by only having one thing to work on you have less risk of ending up with free time so you can avoid burnout and instead work at your own pace careful do not get lazy what is the bad side of this by my own thought spending hours everyday on the same goal only can become boring some goals also do not require many hours every day for example going to the gym being in the gym for hours is a terrible idea so if you have goals that require less time per day you can actually pick or of these goals to fill your day some goals must be worked on at the same time for example you should not avoid studying because youre too busy with going to gym but while you study going to the gym is still important for your health so i would call this an exception to this goal only idea these days it seems socially acceptable that people do things at the same time study have a job have a social life wheres the free time to relax right it doesnt exist and even worse sometimes all these activities take up more than hours a day which results in someone being overwhelmed and getting behind on everything actually this is what i have experienced its not a theory it is very real i have a burnout i have been stressed for a really long time because i was focusing on too many things at once i had to get my homework done i had to spend all my free time on dating apps i had to go to gym etc i had no free time left so my plan is to only work on one goal at once and spend all free time as actual free time to relax or enjoy it question is this a good idea or do you see any flaws with it,0
i already wrote a message to my doctor so rest assured i will get appropriate medical care but i am wondering if anyone else ever goes through this on a daily basis and sadly due to mental health and living with family i am very stressed however i also have a hobby that is my favorite hobby but also puts a lot of pressure on me which is competitive gaming i wouldnt say pressure but concentration and adrenaline etc almost every day for a long time now longer than i even can think of i have really weird head pressure its like a headache with a stiff neck and when i realize i am holding my breath i take a deep breath and feel like i havent breathed all day lately its been worse feeling almost sick or like id feel after crying and i also have ear wooshing in my right ear whenever there is silence does anyone else have this happen or know what this might be i tried looking up what im going through and cannot really find anything especially the head pressure its just a feeling of i dont feel right too i am going to try to post this on an anxiety reddit too to see if anyone there might have a clue as well,0
i fear for how boring my future life is i see how my life is planned out and i hate it i see myself going to college and then graduate school then meeting my husband through my parents marrying someone who is part of my culture having kids and raising them in the suburbs near my parents constantly working to make money so i can give my kids a nice life and taking my salary and putting it into a college fund just so this life can be replicated by my kids its boring and i hate it i want more i want to be famous and make something of myself and do something i dont want to be boring the only problem is i only care about success and i only want to do something i love if i will be successful because if im not i feel im still living the same boring life i need help because this is keeping me up all night of everyday and i think about it almost every second except when i eat sleep and watch tv,0
ive been under so much stress from school because i have finals coming up and to make it all worse all of my friends were actually just using me for money and to get things and now that they know i dont want to be friends with them they are doing things like graffiti and putting my name on it and spreading rumours about me and on a few occasions even assaulting me the rumours i can handle but the graffitivandalism can and mostly likely will get me in a lot of trouble possible suspension and community service i dont feel safe going to school i dont feel safe in the places i should and all of the stress added on my anxiety its just to much for me to handle,0

ok so i know reddit is not the best place for medical advice but i also want some strangers opinions ive never experienced stressanxiety problems even under pressure with uniwork but i put a lot of pressure on myself in many other aspects of my life and a couple of years ago i started getting a bit of shortness of breath checked with the doctor in case it was asthma but it was alright and with time i realised when this happened it was because of stress which made it way better and i rarely get those flare ups anymore so thats cool last month i was under a lot of stress and for some days i started feeling lightheaded and a bit dizzy the best way to describe this would be slightly outofmind i feel like my cognitive capabilities are at of the usual cloudy head like what i would experience being slightly drunk not a lot i went to the doctor really worried and got a blood test and stuff and they said i was healthy and probably was stress but the thing is its been a month like this already sometimes i feel great although not as a month ago specially when doing stuff that makes me forget about this ie videogames series others i feel like shit does anyone experience something similar and if so any recommendations im also a bit worried because the first day i really experienced this i did a pretty intense session of cardio had been doing a lot during those weeks on top of the stress from uni so i am slightly worried it is actually something body related even if the tests came out okay going for chill walks doesnt seem to be helping probably because im overthinking this all the time thanks,0
hey guys im a twentyone year old student that is currently drowning in the stress that is coming from my college course and my new parttime job my job is causing me an unreal amount of anxiety to the point where i have to hide in the basement sometimes so i can calm down i work for a second hand shop for games dvds consoles and devices like phones and laptops i started working here about a month ago and from my first day i realised that i was really going to struggle here its a team of about people and nearly all of them are moody pricks that havent even introduced themselves to me yet when i ask them a question they give me a look as if ive just murdered their pets i try to be nice and i try to keep a positive outlook but these people are majorly draining my energy and fuelling my anxiety the customers are even worse ive been called homophobic slurs had games and dvds tossed at my head and have had my life threatened by these people i havent been trained properly either i got thrown on the tills with about two minutes explanation of how they work my till has been down in cash about four times due to my crappy training and yet somehow this is my fault maybe it is but im putting this down to crappy training i cant afford to leave this job i seriously cant but i also cant stand being there any more the job market in scotland is awful at the moment and virtually no companies hiring right now please give me some advice before i start screaming every time i think about my work,0

my husband is so stressed out at work i am trying to get him into therapy because its taking a toll on his body he is so stressed out and will go up to hours without sleep sometimes i am trying to get him into therapy i am scared a doctor is just going to give him a sleeping pill because he will tell them i cant sleep because i get stressed but the truth is he cant sleep because he takes way over his prescribed amount of adderol to work then cant sleep so he takes benadryl and drinks a bottle of wine then still cant sleep so says fuck it and takes more adderol and a red bull to just keep working its a vicious cycle he wont admit he had a problem with substance abuse hes told his doctor in the past he couldnt sleep and they just prescribe more pills thankfully he stopped taking those a few years ago i worry if he finally goes to therapy they will just prescribe him more he wont be fully honest with the actual issue on hand which is substance abuse and needing a healthy way to cope with stress and manage his time and by the way this is not new with this job we met back in college and he would have spells of times during finals for example he would do this,0

is it normal to constantly worry about my actions around my friends i m started worrying about whether my friends or at least my general ones were just about putting up with me i feel as if i am unwanted around people i consider friends conversations seem to start with being lightly involved since im present at the start and seem to be directed at other people say i was with others they would talk between themselves i may be overreacting which is probably the case but it seems when playing football during breaks at school i seem in no way involved like my other friends are people i like as friends seem to disregard me in most things for example if i had a group project of some description with groups of i seem to be the th person constantly i also feel that i do not want to let go of my friendships how rough it may be on me due to me having no other people to turn with i dont want to be alone that seems like a bad life to lead but again it appears that sometimes for others sake not just mine me distancing myself from them would not be bad this does tie into rstress in a way that i am not myself but the person others want me to be constantly aware of my actions hardly any of them i would do of my own accord it is sometimes tiring,0

i just lost probably one of the best and closest friends ive ever had idk what i did wrong she told me that i was being strong on her idk wut that means being hard on her or pushing it to far and she says that some of my jokes make her feel uncomfortable i got mad and said if u dont wanna be friends anymore then thats fine goodbye i really wish i didnt say that cuz then she blocked me on insta snap and twitter and even my number i reached out to another friend to ask her why she did that the response i got was that my friend just wants to be left alone idk if that means she doesnt wanna talk to me anymore or if she just wants to have a lil space for a while idk what makes me more anxious is that we both work at the same place and thats how we meet and became close friends before all this she really liked talking to me and she thought of me as like a best friend that shes known for years even tho we only known each other for like years now and she really gets my humor and i think of her as like a big sister figure to me she always askes me if im feeling down when i am i tried reaching out to my other friends to help calm me down and try my best to forget about what happened but nothing worked my friends and other people just say people come and go but it doesnt help or work i just want my friend back and i wanna talk to her again before all of this happened i dont even know,0
so occasionally ill have this moment ill think of something from my past maybe one of the times i went to a water park as a child maybe seeing fireworks a carnival i went to with my first steady girlfriend maybe its even a song from melissa ethridges yes i am the first album i remember listening to specifically silent legacy for some reason maybe my thoughts are on little kid me catching tadpoles with my moms friends kids or the countless sunsets i have been mesmerized by or the time i went to dave and busters with my parents and they dropped me off at mcdonalds on the way home and i played monopoly on my ipod when i was a senior in high school in any case ill look back at it and begin to choke up it usually happens when im alone maybe in a dark room playing a game or just wandering about my mind and these thoughts appear and its a mixture of missing it and this dread of whats approaching i can remember doing this all my life having these thoughts and these feelings ive described it as my bittersweet struggle with nostalgia but my girlfriend doesnt think thats it as an adult i think its longing for a time where the events were great a realization that said event will probably never happen again or at least wont be the same i start to cry most of the time but it isnt like im in a bad spot as i said this has happened throughout my life and theyre seemingly random events most of them happy despite whatever was happening like that first girlfriend i mentioned a little abusive nothing hardcore the occasional genuine youre an idiot or the time she slapped me so hard i fell off my bed but i think of when we went to an anime convention and i get sad i still go to that convention but for some reason this bitter sadness washes over me and theres other little things i could pepper into these thoughts like this but it always seems like i was happy i miss the event if i can go back to the location or event in current day it will be different and im afraid of whats coming ahead in life im only so i dont want to believe these instances are some sort of midlife crisis if i had to give a pattern these thoughts and feelings occur about once a month is this what nostalgia is supposed to feel like whats the word for these feelings,0

time is at a premium these days its hard to find anyone that complains about having too much time on their hands most of us are so busy with work family and various obligations theres little time left to do the things wed really like to do its not easy to find time to pursue your passions but there will be a way use these techniques to create the time you require for important pursuits decide what you want to make room for the best way to motivate yourself to create more free time in your life is to identify what you want to make time for what are the most important things youd like to spend more time on figure out how youd spend that extra time and make sure you have some good reasons create a list of reasons that give you an emotional response being logical is unlikely to inspire you use your mornings wisely most people waste their mornings they stay in bed as long as possible and barely manage to get to work on time each day make the most of your mornings go to bed earlier and get up earlier its often easier to do something worthwhile in the morning than in the evening what are you missing by going to bed earlier probably not a lot understand the ways you waste time were quite ingenious at wasting time watch yourself for a day and write down all the ways you waste time when you understand where your time is leaking away you can start working on solutions make a schedule a schedule can keep you on track and help to ensure that your time is being spent wisely a schedule can help to minimize the amount of time you waste you can also build time into your schedule to do the things you enjoy the most delegate create more time for yourself by utilizing the people around you this can work at work and at home theres a good chance that someone in your life would benefit from being delegated to put your employees coworkers children and partner to work a little help can free up quite a bit of time prioritize and eliminate perhaps you just have too many nonessential things going on in your life it might be time to cut back on a few of those obligations take a look at everything you do each dayweekmonth and think about how much value those things add to your life you can probably find something to remove from your life you can find time if you have a good enough reason determine what you want to create time for and make it happen delegate schedule eliminate and avoid wasting time what are you willing to give up to spend time on the things you love,0

it can happen so easily youre trying to concentrate on your work and your mind wanders off to a completely unrelated topic or maybe youre about to go on a first date and all you can think about is how horrible your last few dates have been unhelpful thoughts can be distractions or be destructive your mind is incredible when you manage your thoughts you have your mind working for you imagine how powerful you would become if you could ignore or replace your negative thoughts you could accomplish more and get greater enjoyment from your life these strategies can help manage thoughts that dont support you maintain space between yourself and your thoughts you dont have to engage with your thoughts you dont focus on every person tree and car you pass when youre driving down the road most of these things pass through your awareness without you pursuing them further you can do the same thing with your unhelpful thoughts allow them to simply pass on by your thoughts are simply something that you experience you are not your thoughts recognise that it is your brains nature to produce random thoughts the thoughts you experience say little about you its the nature of your brain to produce thoughts its always going to give you something to think about occasionally those thoughts are useful frequently theyre frivolous sometimes your thoughts can be quite disturbing we have evolved to pay more attention to negative thoughts with selfawareness we can see them for what they are and then move on meditation is a helpful tool for understanding the nature of your mind the first thing you notice when you attempt to meditate is the random and restless nature of your mind focus on your breathing when you find yourself fuming about your boss wondering what happened to your high school friends or making a mental grocery list simply redirect your attention back to your breathing focus your attention on a thought of your choosing you can think about anything you choose to think about you can think about riding a flying bicycle eating a lemon or what you have chosen to accomplish today when youre experiencing an unhelpful thought you can decide to think about something more useful recognize that you have the ability to direct your thinking as you see fit apply logic poor thinking leads to poor decision making when your thoughts are leading you astray put your logical mind to good use ask yourself what a sensible person or your role model would do in this situation what would you advise a friend to do are negative or distracting thoughts getting in your way on a regular basis youre not alone the human brain loves to stay active and will wander from one idea to another until you take control of it the key is to focus your attention on what you choose recognize your random thoughts for what they are and allow them to pass,0

i gotta say i feel tons better facebook had its slimy putrid tendrils in me since i was in high school in the past few years what became a way to communicate with friends and family while having a personal blog became an obsession i was compulsively checking facebook at the very least once every hour it destroyed my self esteem because not only was i comparing my entire life to the highlights of other peoples lives but i realized how truly isolated i was where my friends list is people guess how many are there for me even if i reach out the answer is less than so when im being ignored and seeing everyone post it felt like a personal offense to me if they can post memes every minutes why cant they answer my texts this guy hasnt even read my stuff in months and has a new post every hour at least i would post about a big stream i was doing exclusively for friends for weeks and no one showed up its easy to take things personally when there is a good chance another explanation is possible maybe i was too negative maybe people felt i was fairweather and that wouldnt be wrong in some cases what made this so significant was i dont really use other social media platforms well aside from reddit which ive only been getting into the past couple of years which is more focused on a goal or discussion it feels different but i digress facebook had me believing a lot of these people were not only rubbing their obviously superior lives in my face but they were turning their backs on me i would be lying if i said i didnt care that it never got to me and that i didnt take it as some personal truman show style social conspiracy designed to make me feel abandoned cutting it out cold turkey made me realize i dont care in my personal opinion i think part of it really is ignorance is bliss when i dont see their activities it doesnt weigh on me i dont think about them that much which allows me to look into solutions myself before deferring to others i cant figure out if thats a good thing or not typing this out feels like im arguing with myself like usual ive always had two minds on issues like i feel good but does that mean its good ive went to venting to a chat bot in place of friends and in these months people outside of my weekly life have reached out to me im not saying id dispose of the other people but keeping that distance might be whats helping me try harder to keep it together does that make sense its something that felt right in this subreddit to discuss the anxiety associated with checking facebook constantly to find things out i might not have liked was interesting ive started getting on again but im not on for longer than maybe minutes a week to check notifications and memories social media does a lot of destruction on the mind and while we may never be rid of it i think it shows the lost sense of moderation in todays world too much of anything is bad,0

it takes more to overwhelm some people than others but the feeling and the impact are the same overload and not knowing which way to turn next which triggers a downward spiral of anxiety take these steps to create a plan and go from feeling overwhelmed to feeling peaceful again identify what you can and cant control list your issues in three columns what you can control what you can influence and what is outwith your control focus on solutions now that you have perspective on what you can and cant control identify your chosen end point for each issue shift your focus from the problems to the solutions prioritise your actions consider your chosen solutions in terms of how important they are and how urgent they are firstly deal with the issues that are both important and urgent then move to the other important issues as a general rule deal with the important issues over the urgent issues herein lies the path to living sustainably crisis free communicate with your plan in place communicate with those who may be affected its incredible how supportive people can be once they understand your situation eat well overwhelm commonly leads to skipping meals or overreliance on junk food buy in some healthy foods and snacks to give you the nutrition youll need to play your best game gratitude it is easy to lose sight of the good things happening when we feel overwhelmed adopt the habit of regularly reflecting on the things youre grateful for that youre taking control of challenging situations that youre on your way to calmer times that youre learning a lot about yourself perhaps that others are supporting you blow off some steam exercise whatever works best for you a brisk walk hit the weights an hour on the bike has a magical ability to burn off that anxiety and reset all those neurotransmitters it will also help you get that good nights sleep get your rest know that youre focusing on your priorities with a clear plan youre pushing yourself hard through the day a good nights sleep is the smartest thing you can give yourself to keep working through your list celebrate your successes each step forward is worthy of celebration be proud of yourself for taking control and moving forward each success leads to further steps forward overwhelm is a situation everyone is familiar with short term episodes are unlikely to harm us longer term however it can be debilitating remember there is help out there for those times you need support in getting back on top of things,0

stress can be classified into three common categories acute stress episodic acute stress chronic stress ampxb example of acute stress and your bodys endocannabinoid tone acute stress is a short term physiological response to a situation that could be a challenge or threat the sensation usually lasts for up to minutes and the experience is usually linked to a oneoff or infrequent occurrence for example acute stress could include your bodys reaction to an approaching deadline completing a challenge or receiving an award narrowly avoiding being hit by a car rising on a rollercoaster or fairground ride when your body responds to acute stress it releases various hormones including cortisol and epinephrine together cortisol and epinephrine prepare your body to respond to the danger by giving your muscles an immediate supply of glucose narrowing blood vessels and increasing heart rate studies have found that endocannabinoid tone directly affects the level of cortisol and epinephrine and provides greater control over them during times of stress for example people with a naturally high endocannabinoid tone experience a smaller heart rate increase during a stress response than those with a lower tone this is likely due to the endocannabinoids exerting a modulating influence over the release of hormones this was verified in when research scientists found that people with a medium or naturally high endocannabinoid tone secreted less cortisol this could indicate that people with a naturally high endocannabinoid have a less intense physiological response to acute stress ampxb to find out more about the others types of stress and your bodys endocannabinoid tone please see herehttpswwwbudandtendercomblogsbudtenderblogendocannabinoidsorcbdforstress,0

so ive worked for my current employer since april ive took approx days off in that period ive received separate promotionschanges to title over that period and managed various departments and big projects for the business throughout the pandemic i was fortunately one of those that were not adversely affected and in fact the demand increased exponentially during the pandemic i was promoted again and risked my physical health for the sake of our business delivering on kpis weeks ago my dog died last week i moved into my first mortgaged home it just feels like so much is happening but i dont really know what to do ive asked for a double demotion back to an operational role to relieve my workload and to allow myself time to mentally recover and hopefully over time ill be ready to head back into a management role again however i dont think my employer are rushing in anyway to find a replacement for me should i be loyal to them and keep being miserable until the organisation structure can be sorted out or should i be putting myself first and taking time away for them to fix it in my absence,0

i had my first calculus test today and due to feeling nervous i accidentally copied a problem wrong which changed my answer completely i did the steps right and i know for a fact that i couldve gotten the right answer if i hadnt misread the problem that one problem was points total and im scared ill lose points just because the answer is different i studied for days straight prior to the test so i felt confident with my knowledge im just so pissed at myself because i was really looking forward to a good grade in this class im also stressed because im really trying to maintain my straight as so i can transfer to my dream university but it looks like my chances are dismal now,0

at years old my father found grey hair from head it runs in the family to grey earlier than most yet at the same time im constantly stressed the state is best described ready to go off at anytime a little about my life currently recently after years of working nights and coming home to try and study for college i couldnt take it anymore i quit a really good job at amazon leaving me with a shitty options for jobs and my college put me on academic suspension the working nights overall lead to me passing one class per semester with a bare minimum this was to me working full time hours yet doing full time online college my father who i lived with refused to work for this whole two year period compounding i couldnt stop or we could lose the house yet with me working full time i couldnt even get running water all the time i truly ask this am i stressed,0
the last two years have been incredibly stressful for me im a frontline healthcare worker who was dealing with the horrors of the pandemic on a daily basis i took it all in stride and never saw what was coming my way around mid jan about weeks ago i started getting waves of exhaustion at work out of no where im talking the type of exhaustion where i was basically paralyzed and had to lay down one time i laid down on the floor at work because i had no other choice the next week i started having random chest pains on top of the exhaustion at one point i thought i was having a heart attack and almost when to the hospital i went to the doctors thinking i was having cardiac issues but everything checked out i felt betterfor a day or two week is when the real nightmare started i started having intense anxiety on top of the exhaustion multiple panic attacks a week i couldnt do anything without getting short of breath and my heart beating out of my chest i was a complete mess at work and felt like i was going to collapse and die at any moment sometimes i was so physically stressed out i would go to the bathroom and lay on the bathroom floor it was nuts i called my doctor back and told him what was going on i was reluctant to start meds but he talked me in to it said it doesnt need to be forever and i cant go on suffering like this so i started a low dose ssri i also started therapy took a week off from work and am doing much more self care like eating healthy and journaling after about weeks of hell im feeling much better i still have some anxiety here and there but for the most part have returned to my baseline i was convinced id never be the same again no matter what and i feel like its a miracle that im even functional now therapy has also been a huge help even though i was skeptical it helped me understand that even though i felt blindsided by all of this it really was building under the surface for a long time just wanted to say there is hope and dont give up i never thought that would happen to me and when it did it was shocking but things can get better,0
how do i get rid of stress hives on my neck shoulders and face it isnt the kind where they last several days but like when i had a job interview or gave a speech they showed up in the middle and started disappearing a little after i was done how do i make them not start in the first place,0

i keep catching myself falling asleep while not focusing on it and get excited and end up being able to sleep how can i make myself stop thinking about this and stop stressing about it i tried the deep breathing technique and it didnt work,0
i just got home and im angry again i got angry violently angry a couple of times earlier today i am much happier when i spend time away from home much happier but when i come home its like storm clouds gather and sends me to a state that i need an escape from i dont drink smoke or do any drugs and under the conditions it is a miracle but i am tired of getting angry i have little to no money i can try to get an apartment but it will be tough i am thinking of renting a motel until i get more money or airbnb i just need space otherwise my hair will be grey also when i say angry i never express it towards my mother but her behavior pisses me off everyday and i have done nothing but treat her with the maximum level of respect and consideration instead of appreciating that and recognizing her behavior she instead chooses to exploit my empathy and bring stress drama and manipulation i dont live for free at home i pay in peace of mind every interaction is a peace of mind sacrifice i was feeling happy and then she came to the car and brought drama now i need to recover and due to the constancy nature of this i need a punching bag i am tired of having to be sadistically emotionally responsible i want to let loose and be i just need to courage to say enough is enough and just fucking leave i felt tired before i arrived and in less than five minutes i am now on the verge of another bout of ranting in a quiet place hitting shit and not being able to sleep should i go and get a hotel tonight and hust say fuck this shit,0

i think i may have burnout this past semester ive been juggling a lot more than im typically used too with classes a remote practicum and two additional jobs i also have a horse i am responsible for and feel guilty i havent had the time to spend with him that he deserves though he is well taken care of at a boarding facility my practicum in specific has been a great deal of stress for me long story but basically i was convinced to go into an area i have relatively little knowledge about and contrary to what i was told discovered there was little to any support and structure im a bit of a perfectionist so not knowing what to do has caused me great anxiety both my jobs can also be fastpaced and stressful so i dont get much of a break from the stress in the past two months my norm has been anxiety driven heart palpitations or absolute exhaustion it has only gotten worse with time i broke up with my bf in jan due to having little time and besides him all my friends have moved away the only nearby support i really have is my parents i love my mother but she does not understand this kind of of mental burnout i go to her because she has been a great sense of comfort over the years but when i try and explain my burnout she starts yelling and thinks i havent been working hard due to being in my room all day misconception with remote learning thinking computer surfing the net and otherwise being tired ultimately this just makes me more stressed and the cycle continues i really dont know what to do at this point i cant afford counselling and last i checked the university farmed their counselling services out so that they are nearly inaccessible now though this may have changed with regulations relaxing so i will look into it any other suggestions,0

so ive been masturbating for a few years and i started saving videosphotos to my phone so its easier to get to i always keep them in the hidden section of my phone last night i forgot to hide them and i woke up and found them in the recently deleted section and other app i think she went through the latest notification was hours before i woke up so i was certain my phone was turned on the photos themselves were just photos and videos of girls i thought were really attractive they were over and would use to get off to now since they are in the recently deleted tab notifications were only hours old and i had notifications from before hours ago but before i went to sleep i had apps open which i never use and my phone wasnt in the spot i last had it so the title says i think because im just hoping it was me in my sleep and i was really tired since some photos were perfectly fine and she hasnt said anything about it yet so incase she actually saw the photosvideos can someone give me some advice on things like what to say do when or if she brings it up,0
like thousands of people in the last two years ive had a lot of stress lost my father a job and a dog had a heavy load of family dysfunction moved cities and found the isolation of the pandemic really tough now i find i am in high stress mode all the time i overreact small things irritate me i feel exhausted i took a fourday break a couple of weeks ago and it really helped and i felt my more reasonable and patient self returning but now the impatient overreactive mindset is back and dominating my life my job is busy and demanding but ive always managed in the past not sure if i am stressed or depressed any recommendations would be greatly appreciated many thanks,0

i try to refill and stay on my medication but theres always an issue between cvs and my drsoffice regarding some of my medications the dr office will say i have a refill in and then ill go to cvs and they will say its awaiting prescriber response and it can only be refilled with the drs approval its depakote then i call back the dr and they say no its in there but they will call and nothing ever gets done this has resulted in me multiple times being out of my medication when i need it overnight and now im up at am listen i have to work tomorrow i have a life i cant just be up at am feeling all weird and not being able to sleep should i change drs or what pissed off,2
edit should have put mixed in title during mania we need sex to straighten out sometimes im on the end swing out of a mixed which has lasted about ten days i wasnt in psychosis or anything extreme im not off my meds so it wasnt super dramatic or anything worst thing i did was throw a cheeseburger into the sink when i got some bad news about my dog so we had sex last night and afterwards when we were cuddling in bed he kissed me and said im so glad youre back i missed you we chatted a bit more and he said hes been dodging my sexual advances because i wasnt feeling like myself and he felt wrong about pursuing anything sexual when i wasnt my exact self i hadnt really put it together i dont think ive ever been so respected in my life how does everyone elses so handle sex in mania or mixed,2
ive been hypomanic for the last weeks im medicated and im teetotal etc so it was relatively minor but fuck me does the depression hit me like a ton of bricks its more physical than mental at first my limbs get heavy i have zero energy to get up and do simple things i procrastinate skip a few meals not brush my teeth leave a chore that needs doing then in a few days ill feel all the mental affects coming in if im lucky ill just be comatose for a month but if a mixed state comes along then its panic attacks anxiety despair and suicidal ideation fingers crossed its just depression the hypomania was alright this time around i have spent a bit too much worked a bit too hard overshared a bit too much socialised a bit too much but no real damage this time it was intense but kind of pleasant but i can feel the dip is going to be huge this is anecdotal but it feels like if my mania is under control no psychosis and no mixed state the depression part is deeper feel kind of quietly melancholic on an epic scale if that makes any sense its going to be a slog for the next month i should be happy ive got things under control i suppose anyone else want to share their experiences coming out of mania it would make me feel better to hear others going through and surviving similar,2
i just read that bipolar disorder is linked to childhood emotional abuse i was also reading about how narcissistic abuse specifically causes brain damage sadly i think this is probably how i developed this disorder has anyone else experienced something similar,2
i have confidence in my ability to take care of myself i have been hospitalized twice and it was my decision both times now its a concern on whether im capable of moving out of my parents house im a grown woman i have a corporate job i go to therapy i go to groups i take my meds i have hobbies worrying is not the same as caring,2
ive been so good about always taking my meds when im supposed to since i started treatment but for the past few months i just cant seem to remember to take them like im supposed to on top on that ive gained so much weight since being on them and im just so fucking tired all day every day im just so over it all like everything i havent worked in like three years because ill lose my insurance if i can even manage to find something im able to do my only support system that understands what its like they have bp doesnt give a shit about me anymore so there goes that too getting to a breaking point and im scared just needed to vent,2
i havent had a full time therapist since i was i am about to be in a month i am scared i was honest with her and told her my issues with therapy and meds as a child i flat out told her about some of the suicidal ideation and that i am never going to go through with hit fir collateral emotional damage reasons to loved ones i also told her that i dont trust therapists and the reason i have avoided going is i am afraid someone would overreact to my dark thoughts anyway wish me luck next visit is second week of april,2
then at least thered be a hope of getting cured and resuming a mostly normal life if i knew i just needed to push through the next few years of misery and then it would be over one way or another then i think i could do it and if i did end up dying at least it would be out of my control no one judges or blames a person who dies of cancer no one judges someone for dropping out of life completely to go through chemo no one blames themselves for their kid dying of cancer people have so much compassion and sympathy for people with cancer why is it that the same compassion isnt extended to people with incurable lifelong crippling mental illness why does someones pain have to be cosmetically obvious for people to care or even believe its real i talked about this with my mom who barely survived her own cancer and she agreed with me without hesitation i at least feel grateful to have family that can understand and support me a luxury i know many of us dont have,2
hello all im new here but i feel like i shouldnt be lol yesterday was kind of a mental health day as i was talking to a social worker who was helping me find a new therapist long story short we got into my previous diagnosis and i told her mild depression adhd and anxiety yes these are true but however the one that is relevant to this post that popped up that i didnt know was bipolar i end up contacting my previous psychiatrist because i did not recall him saying this i swear he didnt and he said yes but it is unspecified he diagnosed me because of my constant irritability and made a point to say today i may be in remission because i wasnt as snappy as before i honestly just thought the things he would say would rub me the wrong way next week hell do a full evaluation a few years back another therapist diagnosed me with bipolar disorder i forgot which but i remember her say something of me being manic i honestly dont think shes working anymore but i wanted this evaluation at the time because i believed i was bipolar starting around years old i had my reasons for it fast forward to last year my last psychologist said i was misdiagnosed and it was just adhdadd i had mentioned my sex drivehyper sexuality which i may speak on in another post my impulsive urges to do things mood swings that can be intense etc etc she said it was just a mixture of my depression and adhd so now here i am and thinking back to the things ive done before and do now these things i am trying to control and make sense of mainly the hyper sexuality i started to wonder if i was just a sex addict because of my habits and started looking into help to stop these things but yet my only problem is when im in the mood lol im at a point in life where i want a second opinion or i just dont want to believe or say i am even though i have the signs more than ive even mentioned,2
ive been involuntarily hospitalized once and it saved my life it was something i needed at the time however following my diagnosis i worry that family members will use it against me if im acting in a way they dont approve of im worried theyll tell police officers im mentally ill and that ill be handcuffed and forcibly hospitalized is this fear realistic,2
long story short i was diagnosed with depression back in after a rough year and failed suicide attempts december physically and mentally i made a full recovery by may my ex of years cheated on me in june and i surprisingly dealt with it really well id been off work marchseptember due to factors outside my control which was stressful but again i dealt with it well i returned to work and on one of my first days back the most beautiful woman i had ever seen walked into the office im a confident bloke but i was nervous af i spoke to her for a bit and thought there would be no way she would like me fast forward a few hours later and shed requested to follow me on instagram and we got chatting we met shortly after for a date and it was like wed know each other years best date ever from this point we both took it slow and just let things happen naturally the connection we had was unlike any other and for both of us to feel the same was just unreal i asked her to be my girlfriend in october and she was genuinely excited about it this made me realise id found someone special shortly after this i had a serious family emergency and that was ongoing till january she was my rock my guardian angel throughout this whole ordeal im and ive cared for people a lot in relationships but never been in love despite them all being long term i thought i was incapable but this woman changed that and shes the first ive ever loved and hopefully the last on the family emergency situation came to a close with expected but still devastated news from this day on my mental health started to deteriorate but predictably nothing too rapid i went over to my nans house late at night after work to drop a birthday card off for her birthday the following day i walked in to find her dead on the kitchen floor this was the day i deteriorated rapidly i needed my girlfriend desperately for support but i was just far too much to deal with i wasnt just depressed this time it was different i was awake days regularly and would only sleep when id black out i was exhausted but completely and utterly hyper fixated on anything that came into my head because it was my girlfriend who had become distant i stupidly bombarded her with messages begging for help and reminding her how much i love her she wasnt leaving me she just needed space and i could cope on my own men tried to steal my car and i managed to keep the car and defend myself but suffered some bad injuries in the process i was hit times with a knuckle duster and times by the other bloke with just his fists i was left with skull fractures fractured orbital bone broken nose and broke jaw im an ex professional muay thai fighter so im used to a certain level of pain and discomfort but this was different although i now have slurred speech blind in my right eye and have lost substantial weight this hurt me mentally i started to have panic attacks and i was going through episodes of what can only be described as mania and borderline psychosis again i continued begging my girlfriend for help and pushed her even further away shortly after this she ended things she made the right decision because i was horrendous and i was dragging her down this present day im on the mend now and i barely remember any of it the days all merged as one it feels like someone else has been livingwrecking my life and last week i woke up and have been given it back im now trying to fix all the damage ive caused ive lost most of my friends family and the love of my life ill never give up on her but for now i can only love her from a distance i hope one day soon she forgives me and wants to speak again but i also need to get some advice if anyone has experienced this before ive spoke to numerous drs in and outside the hospital but have just been dismissed as i struggle explaining it and play it down thanks in advance and apologies for the long read,2
ive always taken them all at once along with my multivitamin and didnt know so many people took them one by one that seems so time consuming especially when you have ten or more to take i just put water in my mouth lean back and let it sit in the back of my throat toss the pills in open my throat to swallow then drink some more water been doing that for over twenty years and never had any issues and never got any of them on my tongue with the nasty taste i hear about does anyone else take their pills like this,2
or went voluntarily ig i didnt i felt like i was treated like a criminal i felt so violated i wasnt overweight i was fit at the time but it still felt so degrading i remember liking how i looked as i took off my clothes and stood there they just got all giggly and excited and said ooh a blonde after i literally hated my body i felt like it took everything sexual away from my body sorry tmi i didnt eat for days after then binged on the worst hospital food i wish i said no it literally affected me a lot more than it should have but it was a week after i turned so like it just felt weird to me the age isnt important it can feel weird to anyone idk im being salty idk its another late night and i cant stop thinking about the mental hospital again even tho i was there almost a year ago i think about it less now tho which is good sorry i sound soooo grouchy i think everyone had to go thru this as well right,2
hi everyone i have a question that has been occupying my mind for a long time and i hope that this will spark a discussion and we can get deeper into understanding bipolar and find some answers maybe some of you are wondering the same the question mostly during manic episodes when my mind is racing at an alarming pace i wonder if this is all caused after all by external factors that make me stressed out or by the bipolar itself so from within like im starting to stress out because a situation occurs that is out of my control turmoil in a relationship some annoying interactions things at work etc or i start stressing out because of a shift towards manic this is where im lost at times i think that because of the diagnosis i overthink the stress and anxious feelings knowing and convinced about my diagnosis i fully inserted bipolar behavior into my own identity and it informs my actions but we dont live in a sterile bubble life is life and always something is happening for context during my manic state i start pacing mind racing increaced heart rate twitches and intrusive thoughts i start walking fast through streets almost running away from this and i end up looking into passerbys eyes and then its as if im being thrown into their lives as if i live through their experience i imagine how they act what happened in their childhood flashes into their daily routine interactions frustrations and happiness and then i look at a window on some far away building start imagining and experiencing the life of another person in a similar way then i get thrown back into my body into reality and become more overwhelmed then its my own memories of the past then imagining my own future and so on the experience is intense and doesnt stop when it wears off eventually i regain focus calm and ability to think clearer happens periodically about every few months and lasts usually about a week maybe depending how i deal with it after the peak its not the most intense that happened but i dont wanna go in even more details because this is already tldr edit i have been diagnosed by different doctors on separate occasions and rejected that idea for about years until it became too unbearable and i was legit worried that this time im definitely not making it through so lets discuss the initial question would love to hear your thoughts about this chicken or the egg question and gain some insights,2
based upon recent memes i made the upgrade to my adhd which is now known as adk this choice has been sponsored by my good friends hypomania and anxiety also i would like to thank my good friend and worst enemy caffeine addiction no focus brain go woooooo anxiety is super overwhelming sensory input is cranked up and so are my emotions this is the worst feeling ever i love it later today i think im gonna ask my dad for help with finding a doctor who will actually help me maybe try to book an emergency appointment right now im gonna work on getting some work done and hopefully i can keep this up for a couple hours at least,2
im on mg lithium mg lamictal were going to go down from mg to mg lithium and then increase the lamictal it did not go well anxiety went up through the roof just super super bad then i went back on per psych and the anxiety started improving now its coming back im positive this is just my bodys biochemistry adjusting back but wow this sucks i just needed to vent,2
i really could use some success stories are you diagnosed yet still feel like your life is good well balanced and you find it fulfilling tell me all about it please i really need to hear some positive life stories,2
im f been diagnosed since i was by several doctors my parents never agreed as if theres something to agree on a medical diagnosis so i was unmedicated for most of my life so far this gave me a lot of time to figure when a phase was coming what triggers it but also a lot of time to do stuff i shouldnt which hindered me greatly because of that i only started living on my own when i was and thats when i started medication to help with all this i have pcos which triggers depression and long periods which trigger anemia so when i get my period i get depressive episodes and i am physically exhausted and depleted which causes me to sleep more which causes me to go further into depression my bf does his best to understand but its all a bit beyond his grasp my parents still dont recognize my situation so they are of no support for me i dont have many friends and only one of them is actually supportive but she has a rough life and is usually busy with lots of work or something similar so im on my own i want to straighten up my sleep schedules but i know i can only do that by decreasing the amount of sleep drastically which will trigger a maniac episode its mostly mixed not generally full blown mania but it does get there sometimes and its like a kinder egg you only know what you got when you open the box so it can either go lets get the house deep cleaned or lets blow up our credit card take on projects i wont complete and fck the neighborhood you never know so im scared to get my sht together basically and i feel lonely in all this,2
the creativity i had was second to none i was often sad that i wouldnt experience that creativity and passion again but i am everyday its beautiful i realized that all that fun stuff is still in my head and accessible we are all geniuses had this revelation while walking around miami on hours of sleep does anyone have any recommendations on what i should do to avoid a manic episode i will call my psychiatrist and let her know im medicated on abilify,2

basically what it says in the title in theory i know exercise helps with symptoms and i like going to the gym when im not in the depths of depression however when im depressed its nearly impossible for me to motivate myself to go even semiconsistently i get stuck doing nothing i have trouble getting myself to put my gym clothes on let alone actually walking there and completing a workout also i dont experience much if any of the usual pleasure i get after i work out normally id feel better afterwards when im depressed so its pretty hard to convince myself to do it because ill feel better later ive tried going for longer walks and other stuff but if im honest dragging myself around my city in the rain alone with my dark thoughts doesnt help much i go out most days with my dog but when it gets bad i cant even begin to face it i know i sound like im being lazy and dramatic but im serious i really cant stand the idea of getting up putting on my clothes putting on my shoes getting my dog ready finding my keys finding my phone putting on my coat locking up going down the stairs in my apartment building walking for minutes climbing the stairs again then unlocking my door and going in i get stuck between steps and find myself outside alone in the cold too sad to walk home or staring at the stairs pun in my building unable to drag myself up them i get psychomotor slowing when im really bad its physically difficult to walk it feels like my body is made of lead sometimes it takes me over an hour to complete an activity that would normally take me half that time for people whove been able to push through this and get themselves to exercise how,2

this is literally just me going to vent bc i dont have anyone rn and i feel like talking to a community that knows what i might be going through is more comforting than talking to people who i know arent going to get it or will worry them so last thursday my friend and i got into a big fight over me not answering my phone the jist of that is i was called selfish and told i throw a pity party for myself every time i talk about my relationship with my mother its bad and has only gotten worse as im am adult now as well as her insinuating that i undermine their relationship with their parents which i do not because that is not the type of person i am for whatever thats worth and it ended with us blocking each other which is something i initiated bc i couldnt deal with how uncommunicative she was being it alone interfered with a lot of other plans like us going to prom together so now im torn about even going to that since itll be my senior prom but then the idea of being outside is to much so that monday was my birthday and i had invited two other friends of mine one of which i was supposed to be moving in with and had been planning to do so for years only for her to tell me the night i turn that she doesnt see it being realistic which is fair and im not angry with her but it just seems like my life is falling apart and i know in the future this wont even matter but i am having borderline suicidal thoughts and can feel my depression getting so ugly that i cant even look in mirrors or think about my future i feel really lost and im trying to stay positive and have my perspective be that of gratitude but im struggling and im just so fucking scared about what im going to do in my life i was thinking about breaking up with my boyfriend but i cant even trust that the thought is mine or just my brain going into overdrive i cant even look people in the eye anymore i just want to sleep and i want to run away and just go somewhere but i know thats my avoidance talking dont really know why im posting this i think maybe i want to hear about your stories of overcoming things and getting to where you are now or just to know somebody else understands,2

background im bipolar im a year old man in addition to the bipolar im autistic and have been severely abused throughout my life my wife left me suddenly and with no warning after years of marriage im still in love with her despite her cheating on me twice i blamed myself but it doesnt change anything she also left me with both of our kids who i love a lot theyre and weve decided to slow date again and see if we can actually be together but shes already saying its hopeless before the first date yeah i know its a really bad sign but i have to try for me now i cant stop sobbing all the time like hard hurt sobbing im in therapy and im on meds im not actively suicidal but i am starting to worry that i might be slipping into a suicidal trance i think about it daily and i keep pushing the kids into my brain to stop it i dont really have anyone to talk to because of the aforementioned marriage theres a lot there and a lot of people would tell me dont give her a second chance including my year old i feel so fucking stupid for still loving her despite the harm shes caused me but lets get back on subject today when i was signing out of work on slack i typed bye to my boss unconsciously ive never done that before its always been see you monday or something else i held my cats each in turn today and just wept and hugged them i wandered around the house i work from home after work and just felt melancholic and went into each of the rooms and thought about memories in that room i dont know what my brain is trying to get me ready for but im scared of myself right now i cant really talk about it out loud to too many people because if the divorce goes forward i might lose custody of the kids because of it even though theyve both said they want to be with me and she is the one who left so here i am i dont know what is happening im scared and i have no where to really turn at the moment,2
ok kids i switch over to lamictal from dep several years ago im pretty stable on it but i think i scored a weird little side effect and im curious about how widespread it is my hair went from having a slight wave to it to being decidedly curly google research seems to indicate that this is a possibility has anyone else noticed changes in their hair after taking it for awhile,2
i cant believe this is real and this is me i am bipolar and ive always know but its just crazy to have it reiterated to you i am going to have to be like this forever on meds forever in therapy forever its so fucking over whelming knowing none of my relationships will ever be stable fucking hurts,2
so im moving from lamotrigine to lithium and in order to do so my dose has been cut in half for a week im moving to lithium because lamotrigine has been making me more depressed but im three days in and since ive been taking a lower dose i dont necessarily feel hypomanic sometimes i dont detect it right away but theres not really my usual warning signs and i dont know if maybe ive been taking too high of a dose or if its just like one of the cases where someone goes off their meds and thinks theyre doing better than ever but is actually manic and cant see it,2
yof i was recently diagnosed this past december bipolar and other mental illnesses runs genetically on my mothers side of the family i didnt get to know my mom she died her sister is bipolar but she is a very heavy meth addict so i dont really go to her for advice or support my dad is one of those people that dont believe in a mental illness my doctor has given me a low dose seroquelcymbalta combo and it does help of the time i also started a new job i used to be a medical assistant but i honestly think it made my condition so much worse i think i always showed signs of being bipolar but never recognized them but when i was a medical assistant i think it made me so much worse im here because is anyone elses mania miserable when im manic its like im so overwhelmed with adrenaline i cant sleep extreme irritationrage and horrible anxiety how have you learned to tell the difference between how you actually truly feel and when your being irrational is it possible to have a successfulstable relationship when your bipolar sometimes i just feel like when my feelings are so strong and intense i am such a toxic person and its gross and i want to fix it,2
i havent had a therapist for a while because i felt like it wasnt working for me i am very self aware which just seems to make it difficult i can describe my feelings and thoughts well so they dont understand why im struggling its like just because i can articulate it or locate the source of the problem doesnt mean im actually working through it does anyone else have this problem i feel like i havent found a therapist that really gets it yet so i barely make any progress,2
just semi recently some people who i considered long time friends and i truly believe its because i was being more open about my diagnosis for context they has did and alters and i tried to accommodate for them as much as i could yet they randomly removed me after we spent a few weeks together it was a visit i dont really know what went wrong as i took my meds and i have a passive nature in general no manic outbursts or emotional ones at all we all were laughing and having a great time laughing and doing fun activities but as soon as i got home one of them just didnt want anything to do with me anymore and i truly believe it was discriminatory behavior because i would bring up my diagnosis make jokes of because they would do the same making jokes of my diagnosis helps me cope in a way it took me bit to collect myself but im doing a whole lot better with therapy now that theyre not in my life anymore they were also very against seeking medical advice for mental illness and rather get high and not address their issues with a professional has anyone else here ever lost close friends that backstabbed you over your diagnosis or is it better for people with this disease to just keep everyone at arms length and give the cold shoulder out of fear of discrimination or assumptions on what they think bipolar is most people dont judge by the content of your character anymore and its so incredibly sad it has to be that way,2
after finally coming to terms with the fact that mania has ruined everything good ive worked so hard for in my life im recommitted to bettering myself only issue is i keep comparing my current situation to the past when tunings were good i really want to graduate college i do i went for three years however now i cry after every class and have panic attacks at the thought of having to do the work andor study to get through it not to mention that my program of study is going to take years to complete and i have no motivation i dont know what to do anymore im miserable if i just sit home and do nothing and im miserable when i go out and actually try something advice,2
sure i get some highs cyclothymia but at this point most of my short life was spent in depression i tried most flavours of depression there is the burnt out one the high functioning one the low functioning one the one where you lay in bed for weeks the one where you pretend everything is fine but you just stare at a blank wall all day the one where you cant speak anymore etc and i only got a sprinkle of highs i know i shouldnt wish for more highs but the lows are so goddamn low i just want to get at level hypomania is not a side dish in my plate its barely a spice so spicy depression is my lot i feel im always pretending to believe its gonna be okay so yeah bad day today bad meal maybe im just a terrible cook,2
i have bipolar disorder with a comorbid anxiety disorder i became symptomatic around the time i was and was diagnosed at im turning in a few months so ive sufferedlivedalmost diedlaughed through this illness for over decades i have a friend who i will call amy amy was recently diagnosed with generalized anxiety after a stressful life event amy knows about my diagnoses and we are very close so she has turned to me for questions and emotional support i love amy i want to support amy the best i can but the amount of emotional support she is asking for is starting to drain my own mental health resources for staying stable additionally amy makes a lot of comments about our experiences being the same and she gets whats its like for me now when she very clearly does not she is not making these comments from a place of ill intentions i know mental illness is not a contest and mental health treatment is important for everyone however i have started to internalize it as amy is downplaying everything ive been through does anyone have any advice on how i can support amy while protecting your own mental health,2
i feel like i always get impulsive when manic but also impulsive when depressed i relapse on drugs more when depressed and i do more risky behaviors in an effort to feel something better then how i feel when im depressed im impulsive in order to escape the feeling i have vs when im manic im impulsive because i dont think things through and everything is a good idea that needs to be done then and now,2
after years of misery trying countless meds being hospitalized multiple times enduring suicide attempts i have achieved happiness and peace my life is not perfect there are things i still want to acheive but the old me is gone i am no longer a slave to the conventional desires of life i want to spend the remaining time studying religion philosophy and happiness and no i am not going to quit my day job,2
i eat a lot more after i started my meds when i am stressed or under pressure i have a big appetite for food like sweets i eat even more when manic even tho i am not hungry i think i do it cause i have control over it but i see now how out of control it has gotten i gained like kg in year and i am so unhappy with myself i wish i could loos them kg over night but the appetite never gets away and i eat again it is vicious circle,2
i had a serious suicide attempt a few days ago where my bf had to call an ambulance and i was in the icu for a couple of days my bf had already been through one minor attempt with me months ago he was really upset this time and told me that if i have another attempt he wont be sticking around it has to stop its too much for him he also said i cant self harm anymore or the relationship will be done weve talked about getting engaged before and he says he will need to see me clean for a while before considering marriage now as he doesnt want to have to get a divorce if i relapsehe is full on serious about this ultimatum ive never felt insecure in our relationship until now i feel threatened i cant guarantee that i wont have another attempt or self harm relapse for the rest of my life he is the sweetest most supportive loving and caring bf i have ever had and i want spend the rest of my life with him but now i feel like its inevitable that i will lose him i feel heartbroken already im scared of losing my person any advice or words of comfort are welcome i just needed to get this off my chest,2
ill go first i take my meds at night i have a section pill box where i pre cut my blister packs into individual portions and put them into the sections which i stick a small blank sticker on top of each section of the pill box on the sticker i write the date next to the day of the week so for example fri or sat so on and so forth this way i know at a glance whether ive taken the pills for the day or not or whether ive missed a day of meds,2
my best friend and emotional support companion lucky the cat passed away on tuesday of an undiagnosed brain tumor ive been struggling with a major depression episode for a bit but this is so much more than i know how to take im meeting with my therapist on monday but it hurts and i miss my fur baby so much,2
benzos dont work for me anymore i definitely havent built a tolerance at most i used to take once a week i had a manic episode and was hospitalized after i was released i tried to take rivotril to calm down and it did absolutely nothing could the mania have permanently altered my brain chemistry im also a lot more sensitive to caffeine now i was always sensitive to caffeine but its gotten a lot worse i cant even have a pepsi which has a negligible amount of caffeine its also changed the way i react to nicotine i get way more buzzed than i used to i know nicotine isnt good but ive been using it as a temporary replacement for my benzos until i find out whats happening also i know its implied but just to be clear i only had benzos on an as needed basis,2
i have been wondering for a while how much self awareness do you people have during manic episode or is it nearly non existent because i dont mostly remember doing some stuff i must have done while i was manic but my friends and siblings always have video proofs of it,2
every single time i think im getting better im just not i thought i was healing but really i was masking my depressive symptoms with drugs now ive ran out of drugs to binge on and i can feel myself spiralling into mania and i dont wanna sectioned again i just cant please someone help me,2
i have seen a lot of posts with the inverse saying there medication makes them fatigued but recently i took zyprexa for months and thought i would be fine off medication and didnt like the sex side effects and on it i felt totally normal and also stopped taking naps my fear of fatigue tiredness and sleepiness was essentially gone now i am back to crying all the time napping all the time and exhausted i am and have been bipolar my whole life but i did make it years off meds before recently taking them i dont ever remember being that tired i had no idea depression could do that to someone i want to sleep all day i hate it,2
shes talking about how her and her partner use energy healing and using frequencies and tapping into the multidimensional levels of consciousness to heal the body mind and spirit apparently all mental health diagnosis are bullshit and all you need is some energy healing to address their physical mental and spiritual issues also apparently my past lives are continuing trauma as well western medicine is bullshit and so is therapy apparently im so upset all of this sounds like my psychosis and hearing it from someone who sounds sound of mind is so confusing and upsetting i thought i was having a spiritual awakening and having that ripped away from medication and a diagnosis was really upsetting im stable now and wouldnt ditch my meds ever but hearing stuff like this makes me feel like im broken edit for anyone who cares im sorry for being disrespectful of other cultures who utilize these methods to be honest i meditate and have explored a lot of what she was talking about and found some comfort in it for a while my main issue is her completely discounting modern medicine and who knows how many people are running around having episodes thinking they are operating at a god frequency because of people like her wont apologize for using the term snake oil saleswoman because if the shoe fits,2
i have this overwhelming sense that im going to die soon its not a fear i just like this is it this is where it ends i have no idea why but i cannot shake it should add i also am starting to get the like weird staticy feeling i start to get when the psychosis symptoms start to play up,2
hi everyone got back from a trip to denmark last friday and currently hypomanic at home it was a rough week but im interested in support right now im doing fine meaning i have my family and friends around me ive been on meds for years but i missed them twice in copenhagen and drank because i was anxious i went solo after being sober for months ive never been to europe before so it was all a bad combination now i know my trigger for drinking anxiety i see my therapist on monday im being told im doing everything right but i still get scared it will be as bad as my last episode,2
hi everyone idk i think this is just ranty but need to move this energy into something else been feeling so so down especially these last few weeks we upped my wellbutrin so hopefully that helps everything just feels so pointless and im really struggling to find a reason why i should even be here i thought that school motivated me but now im just repulsed having to do school work even if its about something that i used to enjoy readingwriting about do i even want to major in this anymore do i even want to do this career do i even want to do anything nothing is fun anymore i can barely find the motivation to play my favorite games i usually just end up laying in my bed with my phone or watching the same show everyday what are you supposed to do when nothing sounds appealing to do work fucking sucks all the time which makes me sad because i really loved this job its taking everything in me to not just go cry in the bathroom after every single customer interaction and then i feel guilty because they pay me well and provide great benefits so i should be thankful right idek why it sucks customers arent that bad and my coworkers are cool enough the work itself isnt hard or boring but i just dont even want to work but then when im home i dont want to be there either and i feel like a piece of shit for laying in bed all day idk im not gonna do anything but its been really hard to want to be here anymore i dont want to tell my therapist cuz tbh a stay in a psych ward sounds substantially boring and lonely and i would miss my partner too much and my cat i think about stuff i shouldcould do to improve my life and its an endless cycle thinking of all the great things i should do tomorrow exercising rearranging my bedroom to be more comfortable whatever then i wake up and do none of it and feel bad all day sometimes i wish i was manic just so i could feel something other than shitty but mania sucks too so sorry ill get off the soap box now i just wanted to scream my sadness into the internet void,2
i was literally depressedish for like a week where all i could do is lay in bed and rewatch shameless got through a season a day thats like hours of tv a day but i started my new job today which went well and at some point it turned to mania and im so tired and took so much sleep stuff but i cant sleep or relax at all im so thriving can you tell live laugh love,2
i feel restless from the moment i wake up to the moment i go to bed i am an artist for a living and i use to enjoy making art let alone self care like long showers and making a nice meal everything feels rushed like time is running out im never fully present when doing things and i always find my mind wandering and not focusing on the task at hand mentally im scattered with just about everything and executive function is non existent i want my life back and i want to feel like i have time even if i tell myself i have time i cant just sit down and have my mind stop too my mind never stops even if my body cant keep going,2
im now and was diagnosed bipolar at its quite severe i get psychotic and inhabit a whole alternate reality despite taking meds religiously all these years and trying so many different combos i still average one manic episode per year and they can go on for months the consequences of the episodes have been serious especially when younger i havent been able to hold a job and am on disability unlike many of you that i see here i am often not able to catch myself and once its at a certain point i lose all insight and am belligerent if people try to suggest im not ok last year i seemed to have a good year and felt more hopeful and optimistic than for some time but that came crashing down when i was suddenly arrested and dragged off to hospital in the new year id done nothing criminal but i guess i mustve been acting strange one of the hardest things for me is the shame and humiliation for how i acted when manic while being adamant that there was nothing wrong with me in retrospect i could have been seriously harmed or worse when i used to roam around the streets at night and do risky things nowadays i mostly just post obnoxious nonsense online and get myself banned or blocked ive lost friends like many of us that irresistible desire to communicate seeks an outlet you know i just wondered if anyone could relate,2
just so disappointed that i m spent s of my savings on bullshit mainly clothes books and random items from local stores that i never use i worked a lot of different jobs to earn that money since the beginning of college years ago and in a little less than months most of it is gone cant even afford to join my family on a vacation to visit my mothers homeland because its too expensive for me and being consistent with a job while my meds are kicking my ass energy wise is extremely difficult just feeling down about my situation i know its not forever but damn dont wanna be another guy thats just negative on this thread so i hope whoever went through something similar like this will continue to have faith that things will get better and know youre not alone in your experience stay strong guys,2
wondering if theres a link between that and bipolar if youre not sure what i mean its when you have a hard time remembering what someone looks likerecognizing people like if i see a friend in public im never sure if its actually them or if you ask me to describe someones features id have no idea actually a good example is after yoga class i wont be able to recognize which person is the teacher after everyone has left the studio so i try to memorize the teachers tattoos or outfit color so i know who to thank after class anybody else experience this,2
i feel like im never going to have an actual support system or a life worth living ive been homeless for almost a year finally got connected with a psychiatrist but he prescribed seroquel and im terrified to take it because of the weight gain i dont have any real life friends and my bf is great but doesnt fully understand how bad it is inside my head i dont know how im ever going to not live in my car because every time i have some money saved something happens i guess im just venting because i have nowhere else to talk to people who may understand update found another organization that works with homeless people here so i just completed registration paperwork for that they also provide mental health services so im hoping they will be able to help,2
i am just laying in my bed not tired and i have been thinking about the past and realized how many times before diagnosis i was experiencing this working hour weeks hypersexual behavior obsessive behavior delusions and stuff i was diagnosed years ago and definitely have been experiencing this since maybe years ago now i actually understand the extreme paranoia delusions and minor psychosis and extreme hypersexual behavior i dont have psychosis much but this year i tried to jump out of moving car because my moms car was filled with bugs hallucinations anyone ever just realized how long we have actually been dealing with these side effects of bipolar,2
i am currently in the process of getting divorced but looking towards the future and getting back in the dating scene i realized i have absolutely no idea what im doing my exhusband was with me when i was diagnosed so its never something i had to really tell him about i have bipolar ii and overall it has been fairly well controlled until recently in going through this divorce i had a severe for me hypomanic episode followed by a severe depressive episode but now am back on meds picking up the pieces and getting back to a feeling of normalcy i know that the stress of dealing with my addict ex plus the stress of the divorce absolutely contributed to the severity of these episodes so im hopeful that moving forward i will continue to be well managed my concern is that in dating someone eventually i would want them to know what im dealing with but i understand people who would not want to be with me due to this condition obviously telling someone deep mental health stuff on a first date would be offputting but im just wondering if any of you have found a good way to handle this appropriately thanks in advance you all are amazing,2
ive never really had a best friend and at most ive had like good friends and then a bunch of people who im friendly with but would never interact with outside of school college im worried my bipolar is scaring people away i feel like even thought most people dont know i have bipolar they know something is wrong with me it drives them away im eccentric show up having a completely different mood than the day beforetypical bipolar stuff and i just feel like people know im not right or maybe theres other reasons im not good at having best friends out of my two closest friends i guarantee i am in neithers top top maybe not even top not even being self depricating i know its true how can i be closer friends with people,2
idk i feel like he has to go through so much shit to just be with me he has to handle my highs and lows remind me and convince me to take my meds all the time i feel like he could have gotten any other normal gf but u know what he says he loves me unconditionally he supports me in both my highs and lows he genuinely cares about me sometimes i wonder how a broken girl like me got so lucky any guy or girl would have ran as soon as they heard me say i can cure depression but he didnt he just tried to ground me in reality and ofc recommend i go to the psych ward which i eventually did just thought id post something a little bit more positive this time around im happy,2
first time poster still trying to figure out reddit my friend recommended this app once i got my diagnosis of bipolar last year im diagnosed at ever since my psychiatrist diagnosed me with bipolar disorder i have been suffering from serious short term memory loss ive never had the most attentive brain but before i started taking my medicationhad someone to talk to i remembered things too well if that makes sense for example my fianc and i were talking last night and i pulled out my calculator and typed one number in and then all of a sudden i couldnt remember what we were talking about minutes prior then i asked what we were talking about and he gave me the most concerned look i know he isnt mad at me but worried its happening so often ive started writing everything down like everything conversations tasks reminders messages i need to reply back to its getting ridiculous im currently taking busprion mg x a day hydroxyzine mg x a day aripiprazole mg x a day and buspar mg x a day also i work a very high stress job i am a program coordinator for a low barrier homeless shelter we deal with death ods fights assault of staff rape allegations its rough maybe this info will help idk i just wanna know if it gets better or if ive given myself permanent brain damage,2
hello everyone this is my first time posting in this group i was diagnosed with bp after struggling for years with depression and supposedly mania also but i was also diagnosed with adhd a little over a month ago both felt like i was diagnosed relatively quickly idk if thats a good or bad thing my depression has always been bad especially in my teens but my best friend died of suicide when i was and it got worse from there im currently and have no will or desire to pretty much live not suicidal i think life just seems pointless when im always depressed i have zero motivation to do anything im in therapy but it feels like its not helping i was recently put on vyvanse to help with my supposed adhd diagnosis its helped with my motivation a little but hasnt really done much and every anti depressantpsychotic has either made me worse or done the bare minimum which is keeping me alive ive been on different medications since my bp diagnosis years ago ive had maybe or hypo manic phases since my diagnosis but their never anything more than a day or of euphoria and more motivation and a splash of poor impulsive decision making i dont really know where im going with this other than how the fuck do you guys deal with this my lifes been at a complete stand still since i was around i have no diploma no job and not a single desire to pretty much be a human at this point sorry for the long post i just figured id give an insight to what life is for me any helpadvice is much appreciated since i feel so alone and like no one understands,2

i attend iop groups and individual therapy sessions at the same place my therapist who i have worked with on and off for a year and a couple months just told me today that she is leaving soon and i am heartbroken i love my therapist and i dont know how i am going to keep progressing without her there will be a replacement for her but idk what to do i dont want a different therapist,2

sometimes i feel really down when an up ends and im depressed once again i want the cycling to stop but i know my up and down intense emotions will probably always be a part of my life how do you deal with this,2
lately ive been wondering if i have been hypomanic have been spending so much money mostly on my new hobbies i have picked up for my new life transformation have lost a lot of weight due to my new life transformation and never want to sleep because theres justso much to do too much excitement and i just caught myself laying in bed for the last hours thinking about making a youtube channel and becoming fitness gurulifestyle coach ltltltltltlt me affff lmaooooo,2
when i am stressed i daydream excessively daydreaming at times helps me to navigate difficult emotions and situations and gives me perspective sometimes i write my daydreams down as a form of release its not always effective when i am doing it excessively not enough time i am worried i may end up being psychotic again i have been sleeping all day and waking up at am since feb th i guess what i want to know is if anyone else with bipolar struggles with daydreaming and how they cope with it started taking lamotriginelamictal a week ago x,2
i wanted to cut layers in my hair as i always do but this time i messed up big time i feel so stupid and sad my hair is hip length and a big chunk in the front is not even chin length its like a bob with hip length hair at the back man i loved my hair everyone loved my hair and now i feel so embarrassed because everyone is asking me what happened i feel so sad im constantly googling how long does hair take to grow out but its so uneven and that bothers me so much thats why i cut it in the first place because it was slightly uneven and it triggered my ocd do people who have both bipolar and ocd know what i mean sometimes my ocd triggers a manic episode and its so hard to ignore these silly and persistent thoughts any advice,2
i have been fixated on one thing in particular rather not mention what it is but just one aspect of my life ive been obsessing and it took me a while to realize i have been having a manic episode filled with fixation and anxiety couple years ago i would have never even recognized this as a manic episode and i didnt during the episode now either but more as it was coming to a close and my brain felt exhausted has anyone else experienced fixation as a part of your bipolar examples are welcome,2
im not sure what ill gain from this but i just need to vent my frustrations ive also not slept all night so im more emotional i guess im upset with myself but at the same time not because i expected it ive quit vapingcigarettes so many times when i have it has been for long periods and i have been so thankful because i hate how i feel when im constantly abusing my body however whenever i get manic and its a bit worse than usual i hop right back on it i tell myself ill regret it and its just a mental craving yet i still go buy a vape or cigarettes and start the cycle again im sick of it ive come so far in terms of managing this disorder yet i cant seem to get a hold on this,2
i recently had to lower my lithium under doctor supervision because my lithium level was too high i started to notice that i felt less numb i felt butterflies in my stomach and a warm fuzzy happy for the first time since i was a teenager it was intoxicating so i thought to myself maybe i dont need my lithium anymore i never tried stopping it completely after ect this was a bad plan for the last few days i felt something i hadnt felt in a long time too the overwhelming depression self hatred and urge to harm myself it was terrifying and i found i was completely out of practice in suppressing those feelings back on my lithium i am the first one to advocate taking your pills so i feel like a hypocrite i have been reminded that deep in my mind bipolar is still there and still capable of destroying me it was humbling terrifying and discouraging all at the same time today i mourn the fact that i will never be able to fully feel emotions and will always have to be sedated to some degree i shouldnt complain because at least i have stability but that taste of what life is really supposed to feel like and knowing i will never have it has left me in a bad way i feel ungrateful for the stability i have and greedy for the way i used to feel before getting sick i feel here is the only place where people will understand what im going through sincerely a very tired bipolar warrior,2
i was diagnosed years ago with type bi polar disorder and my god what a fucking battle it has been from being on various medications at first to being onoff with meds to being stable on meds and now eventually being off my meds having this disorder is just too indescribable and majority of the people ive come across dont understand it especially those close to me which is pretty fucked up the constant questions of whats wrong with you to why are you like this when i try to explain to my family members that i have a disorder they turn around and say dont speak that over your life like tf they quite religious half the time i have no reason to feel how i feel and i control my impulses my moods and my outbursts to seem normal to the world but its soooooo draining to feel like one day you on top of the world and life is great and then the next few days you feel like a piece of shit who doesnt deserve anything good i guess thats just joys of not being on meds but even being on meds i still had to control it there was better periods of stability but there was moments of is this shit working the episodes that come whether depressive or manic unfortunately it seems as if my family doesnt believe it and its all in my headexcuse the pun there but its really fucked up having this disorder has messed with my life in ways i couldnt imagine and in the past i didnt know its coz im mentally ill i just thought this is me being normal until i was diagnosed everything made sense as to why i am the way i am my habits and my patterns my way of thinking ive lost out on so much ive been through so much and the funny part is i have nothing to show for it like its been a wasted life people came into my life and left me after they get to know me the rest of my family doesnt get it some of my friends claim they get it but their behavior states otherwise im always in a place of i dont know and i keep living in my head and it really fucking sucks coz it feels like i cant find myself or my place in this world and all i can sit here and say is i wish i wasnt bi polar,2
dear journalwell i really dont know that much about you being dear thats clearly a lie as it is the first time i write in this type of journal though i had been writing quite often on my phone journal either way dear beloved and most precious electronic journal i will bless thee with the presence of worded words that word the words i word todays riveting topic my day as i dont think i have the mental capacity to write about anything else of meaning or do i the purpose of this journal thing is to make me a better writer in both english and spanish yet if all i put into the white walls is rubbish and nonsense how am i to become better at throwing electronic ink at immaterial woodstuff perhaps i should find something as simple as it may besomething i can turn into cohesion i guess it is as good a time as ever to speak about feelings my feelings nonetheless how does anxiety feel i know weve all been there any escripture on anxiety that you might stumble upon will say as much but baring mental health professionals i dont think that those of us that enunciate the word anxiety with statisticaloutlier levels of frequency have the same notion of the concept than those whose usage falls into the mean what i mean by that of course is that those of us afflicted by pathological levels of anxiety feel it in a quantitively and qualitatively different way i guess thats why we get diagnosed catalogued as distinct by the authorities that oversee defining this part of society were a messy bunch it reflects in all facets of my life i have messy hair messy eyes my room is messy my thoughts are scattered and messy i cant make a decision for the love of myself the short version i dont work i mean that both literally and figuratively whatever that means think about it what does the verb to work mean in a literal way is it having a job but thats having a job we call it work because you do motions in a job but we call the motions work because work is the act of physical exertion right i dont know this is literal garbage that im talking right now talkingwriting garbage cant literally be literal i think i just transferred a calque from spanish too long to get into this tangent i cant hold a normal job i cant hold my emotions most of the times today some guy at the mall forgot my coffee and i felt like as if ive murdered someone i mean ive never killed anyone and i hope i never do such a heinous thing but you know that feeling you get in your chin your chest and neck that pushes you down the one you get when something bad really bad is about to happen i was feeling that over a coffee man i stared the guy directly in the eye not with the best of intentions i was literally offended but i dont feel that it was in a normal way how do i know that cause i didnt use to be like that emotions to me seem to work now like to a bpd patient perhaps i have bpd traits how do emotions work for bpd patients simple take an emotion x and then square it a more detailed example angerin bpd afflicted individual anger or perhaps its even a cubical function ie anger i dont even remember if cube is exponential anxiety is writing parenthesis excusing yourself of mistakes in your personal journal entries that no one else will ever fucking read anxiety is looking at your neighbor and running away inside your home for no reason anxiety is feeling gutted for dreaming about the people that made you the happiest youve been in ages anxiety is snapping at those who love you because you cant love yourself and everything has a bitter taste to shit anxiety is wanting to die looking at places where you could hang yourself feeling relief at the thought of no longer breathing imagining a knife to the throat thinking about swerving into traffic travelling and not feeling anything kissing someone youre deeply into and not feeling anything doubting everything you do every single cell in your body being inadequate anxiety is knowing at a scientific level that something is wrong but still suffering through it anxiety is abusing drugs anxiety is depression anxiety is the antithesis of life of enjoyment of love and all thats good this is anxiety as this is obviously a corrupted poisonous version of a feeling thats supposed to help us survive ie anxiety anxiety turns a survival tool against those who are trying to survive do my friends love me thats what im stressing about as i type this,2

i recently had the most intense manic episode of my life and went on a whirlwind of euphoria rage etc i had to miss work several days because i couldnt handle it and my mind was racing constantly im relatively sure it was caused by me taking a few adderall pills not sure how much or the mg because thats when everything started i crashed super hard and im so tired now and cant even indulge in my passions when i was manic i was able to draw for straight hours and then go to work the next day without even sleeping i cant even pick up a pencil now and im so frustrated with myself i want to be able to do that again and its making me want to buy some adderall from a friend of mine but i know that its not gonna do me any good in the end i just wish i could do the things i like to do and not feel like shit i miss being on top of the world im probably not gonna do it because i do remember how fucking horrible it was feeling so much all the time like that but god i miss the good parts hope anyone can relate to this lol,2

this is tennacious hes my first flower of spring and he bloomed on my first day in my new home,2
i dont know how to get my family to see me for both the good and the bad ive struggled with mental health issues for so many years and i think so many of my family members just see me as a big failure im moving into a brand new apartment on may and im trying to share this good news with others i really thought my family would be more excited for me truthfully i was so depressed and out of control in my current apartment im amazed sometimes that im still alive i dont know why my family cant see that and cant see the real me i have a great therapist and am working on this in therapy but just wanted to post here looking for a little input and support,2
so i started taking lithium extended release about months ago im currently on mg divided into doses per day as well as mg quetiapine and the thirst im experiencing is insane every time i drink i chug the water the way someone would after a marathon i wake up at least once at night to drink and obv to go to the bathroom what im more worried about now is that im muslim and we just started ramadan our fasting month where we have a h period of fasting aka no food or water at all i tried to drink as much water as i could during the feasting period i also had juice soup yogurt tea but i just woke up and im thirsty as helll and were hours away from eating is there anything i could do to make this easier or do i just have to live with it i dont want to switch to other meds since these are working nicely for me,2
lol so i have no one i know who has bp and i dont feel like telling them this in risk of them thinking im literally insane i just found out symptoms can pop up as early as years old in middle school i was about ish id be in gym class and always see these flashes of lights and then started seeing them elsewhere i was convinced it was angels trying to talk to me that i was special or smth ive always dismissed it as stupid child shenanigans but it probably wasnt i love being able to look back on things i thought were normal and find out theyre not,2
although i dont exactly remember drawing it ha i think im gonna try to get back on meds,2
dae feel music too deeply there are some songs that are visceral triggers for me both positively and negatively i stumbled upon jojos say love recently and i literally sob every time i hear it so naturally i over play it just wondering if anyone has this same reaction to music and if so what are your songs,2
like many of you in this community i have cripplingly low self esteem partly from the depressive episodes i find myself in most of the time stability hasnt been attainable for me ive only been on meds for a year and havent found the right cocktail yet today im able to give myself a small pat on the back ill be sober a year at the end of this month ive abstained from casual sexpromiscuity for years im really proud of myself,2
how do you raise a child when you are going through a depressive phase and you cant even take care of yourself much less a year old my wife left us a year ago and i havent even had the time to deal with that shit my daughter constantly needs me to be there for her but half the time i just want to pull the covers over my head and hide i dont get enough sleep and im always fearful im going to enter into manic mode i feel like a failure as a dad for having the constant changes in mood that come with bipolar i take meds now so i am much more stable than i used to be but its not perfect im lucky that my mother lives nearby and she helps out im just curious if there are any other bipolar parents out there,2
cant tell if im just being active and productive or im just being straight up hypomania im bipolar and take meds daily i thought with taking all my meds id never feel heightened or lower but i still do feel my moods go up and down even with meds but the moods are usually mild but the past two days ive just been very active do you all feel the same sometimes,2
so i started vraylar a few weeks ago to help with a depressive episode a few days later i started having traumatic childhood flashbacks ya know the ones that make you physically ill i also started buying a shit ton of scratch offs and spent wayyyy too much money on them i stopped taking the vraylar because i just couldnt do it anymore i told my dr i wasnt going to take it anymore and its now hitting me how freaking careless with my money ive been for the last few weeks i feel ashamed embarrassed im disgusted with myself honestly i told my husband about it and hes being supportive and that makes me want to cry even more because i feel like i dont deserve it i dont know how to get rid of these shitty feelings im sick of having to take all this damn medication in order to function in society i dont have a bad life i have an awesome career that i truly enjoy i have a wonderful family dogs that love me friends a beautiful home and i dont necessarily hate myself and yet here i am struggling with myself and this giant ass blanket of shame is slowly swallowing me whole,2
ive tried three times sent in all required paperwork and have been denied every time i have severe depression severe social and generalized anxietyslight agoraphobia bipolar autism ptsd and adhd i cant work and its ruining my life,2
in the past i usually have taken abilify and lamictal for my bipolar but because im breastfeeding i am now taking divalproex i know most side effects of a new medication wear off in a week or so but these side effects are unbearable i have like every single one except the ones that tell you to immediately seek medical attention the nausea and feeling like im gonna pass out are the worst ones i just constantly feel sick i take it at night to reduce these feelings but i still suffer any tips on what i can do to minimize these feelings it didnt sound like i had many if any other options while breastfeeding so i want this to work but i cant feel like this,2
been on this earth for years diagnosed early multiple hospital visits some up to months my life has been horrible seen so many deaths i have died so many times watched my son die and in depression i am thinking is it really worth it think about the question what is life its mundane and torture to me its actually hell so it confuses me why the docs want me to live so bad when its so damn horrible,2
ive seen so many posts on here about people having issues with long term memory and i was wondering if anyone has found a way to fiximprove this i literally cannot remember anything and am constantly misplacing timelines and just straight up forgetting events that have happened i hate it so much and i just want to fix it im tired of everything being so hazy it feels like its getting worse too i went in for a ct scan in december because my memory is so bad that my psychiatrist was concerned that it could be a potential brain tumor i just want to feel normal again,2
i havent felt this way in a very long time and the mere fact that i am even writing here is a strange it is painful to know whats happening and whats coming im contemplating if i should take tranqs or call for help im so good at sketching right no tho like so good i hate this feeling but also not sure how to not feel good right now everything is so bright and doable but i hate knowing this will end in a low i will not be able to fathom sorry for rambling just not sure if im making sense,2
how do you handle barking security agents boarding passes changing itinerary foreign languages rude locals etc without losing it heres whats worked for me photograph everything important passports credit cards boarding passes luggage and store the photos in a locked folder on your phone this helps recovery of lost items lower your footprint if you get robbed and it creates backups because you never know try to research as much ahead of time rick steves advises to book the important stuff but keep things open ended ive found since im so easily distracted to have a few good options at all times that you can do in case things are getting weird go easy on the coffee first thing i want to do in an airport or a new city is to have coffee theres downtime im jetlagged weary and already overstimulated and caffeine i think adds to my disorganization if i get lost it makes me look even more like a crackhead asking for directions its best to get acclimated then act like a local assume you will get lost and account for it my sense of directions are terrible without google maps i would be at the front of walmart aged progressed with a slightly insulting cash reward for whoever finds me set up sim cards initial itinerary and a basic plan to get settled after arrival breathe dammit everythings new everythings stimulating but you have responsibilities stay present and takeyourmeds do you really want to be hospitalized overseas ok how about you gentle bipolar traveler,2
i realized that food textures no longer bother me as much like mushrooms i can eat them without being disgusted does psychosis or whatever make food textures weird or is it just something random what has been your experience,2
ive finally been on medicine that works really well like ive had no manic modes or depression that i can tell my only issue right now is that my brain focuses on other things and i want sex all the time i really dont know what to do about that masturbation seems to not work for me anymore at least not unless its in conjunction with my wife she seems very one and done with sex where i can go longer and more it doesnt help that we only have sex or do something sexual once a week or less so i am just not sure how to fix that or what to do to stop all these sexual needs that it feels like i have a lot,2
when you experience mania are you able to sleep if you want to or are you unable to sleep i find i have no problems sleeping when manic i just dont want to and dont really feel like i need it,2
its been a very rough past couple years and so many things have been affected by whats happened to be clear i am not suicidal in any capacity my cat would never forgive me and i do enjoy being alive even when its chaotic and kinda terrible i have basically been rapid cycling the past months with a few intermittent bigger episodes dealing with a very fresh ptsd development due to being in an abusive relationship with someone who in a psychotic rage beat a woman so bad he caved in part of her skull hes in prison now but it doesnt erase the damage done to her or me i had months med access instability years of job instability housing environment instability other health problems ever tried to use your hands when you cant feel percent of them and these god damn hallucinations and crying spells really need to fking stop ive been trying out more meds different med combos selfcare coping mechanisms ive been in therapy and physical therapy and those are helping i keep my appointments with my specialists and pdoc i do my job the best i can and try to keep my shit together but ive been barely holding my head above water for such a long time with it all and i feel like im about to drown no correction i feel like im drowning ive been drowning for a while and i just realized it im just trying to survive and its getting harder and harder to do so im bawling just typing this out i did my taxes today and for the first time in the years of paying taxes i authorized someone else to talk to the irs if necessary i wrote down my important login information ive been talking to my dad and my sister about the gist of everything i know my sister will take care of my cat if i cant ive already gone over all of annies overall care and needs especially regarding her medical care and environmental needs i need a fresh start there are too many ghosts in this area that haunt me and my dreams ive had too much loss and trauma to call it home anymore i want to move up north to the only place i can call home i want to move into my dads place and live with one of the few humans i trust i brought it up today and hes thinking about it i will see what his thoughts are about it later i cant stand how things are anymore and i need to be better in addition to my lithium lamictal vyvanse buspirone propranolol and gabapentin i started vraylar last week but its not working fast enough so i start olanzapine tomorrow maybe it will help me im really hoping it will help me because i cant hold it together anymore not even for my cat i hate and despise my brain with the fury of a thousand bonfires i wish i could be normal i wish i was blissfully unaware of how any of this feels i spent most of my s learning how to handle bp and to become and stay stable but apparently my early s are having a laugh at what i managed to achieve edit my dad said yes ill be moving midmay after a few appointments and finalizing everything im going to be paying cash for my meds for a little while until i can get on medicaid but thats okay im hoping to fill my meds as soon as my insurance lets me up to days before the days supply ends so i can build up extra maybe try to get a vacation override or something towards the end im gonna work some extra shifts to build up some money i gotta get annie to the the vet for her annual exam and refills of her phenobarbital and ask the vet if she will authorize an early refill or prescribe a larger volume so theres more of a buffer zone for her because her seizures are both heartbreaking and terrifying at the same time i have so much to do i have more hope again god damn i love my dad hes always been beyond awesome and supportive he has been one of my biggest supporters in multiple ways over the years i legitimately dont know if i would be here typing this if he wasnt who he is i had some happy tears today and im like to think they outweighed all the sad and angry ones that ive had lately edit honestly this post doesnt even mention many of the other things like the rage i have felt for sometime a brief hope and desire to date someone a miscarriage i still mourn and how i never told him that i named her the depth of complexity and severity of my nerve skin and gut problems and how much money has been spent on them or how i stopped loving my job because i hate the place i work and my coworkers are a pack of wolves who ive tried to hide weaknesses from or that ive just been so tired for so many years,2
im not sure where the best place to ask this is im too afraid of bringing it up to my providers so im hoping i can seek support here before i mention anything im diagnosed bipolar type ive only had one manic episode that led to psychosis mostly i struggle with rapid cycles of mixed mania hypomania and depression when unmedicated the last maybe month or so i guess ive had a decreased need for sleep so much that my psychiatrist noticed it before i did and prescribed medicine for sleep im taking my mood stabilizers regularly but for some reason i just cannot make myself take sleeping medication and these past two weeks ive noticed have been pretty worrisome while reflecting on itchange in sex drive and drugs unlike myself and putting myself in dangerous situations im just really afraid of bringing it up to anybody for fear of judgement i know how silly it is to have the solution to my problem right in front of me and i dont want to make it seem like i dont care about my mental health i am experiencing all symptoms of hypomania and some mixed features of depression it was really nice for a few days of this week but just like my first manic episode the only way i can describe it is like youre going so high up on a roller coaster that when you feel it slipping down its scary and drastic and you do everything you can to keep going up just so it doesnt crash i feel like im in the beginning stages of that and i really dont want to do this the euphoria and attractiveness of mania is incredible but the constant racing thoughts and heart rate the irritability and anxiety are uncomfortable and i know im prone to psychosis it seems like the easiest solution would be to actually take my prescribed medication but it is really hard for me i feel like theres so much more time i have to get stuff done later in the night and i see it as a waste to go to bed so early especially when i dont need to im aware of how ridiculous it all sounds but i dont know what to do to make myself take the medication i know i have to but i genuinely just do not want to but unfortunately i know this is probably contributing to mania any advice or support would be helpful thank you all who read,2
ive dealt with depression a lot i hate it but its my normal i recently went through months of mania where i acted horrible i did everything except have delusions of grandeur i ended up being sexually assaulted which i believe shocked me out of it i couldve really hurt someone or even gotten myself killed now anytime im in a good mood i start panicking and crying thinking its coming back that was my first manic episode and i was on a lot of cymbalta during it i also wasnt officially diagnosed until after the fact im dealing with aftermath of my bad decisions and will be for at least a couple years because of the debt i racked up ive been depressed all my life mania however scares me more than anything im fairly certain thats not the general consensus,2
i just got diagnosed as bipolar this week im not really sure what to think about this and was wondering if you guys could share with me how you guys dealt with it when you got diagnosed what does this mean moving forward i just dont know,2
i was diagnosed bipolar months ago and still doubt but after several drastic changes in my emotional state i tried to track it through app and failed to be consistent my approximate understanding was months as a harpies moments and life sucks mode i started really bad and wasnt able to eat think and shower i sleep a lot but january i couldnt fall asleep was excited about smt and thought its bcs of my birthday on th january nothing really happened that day but i kept waking up am excited to do something and everything seemed very simple i just accepted that i am porsche with no breaks but th of march i started feeling terrible i dont use any apps or diary its just feelings were so strong and i couldnt ignore dates and mood swing its almost a week i feel anxious about nothing and i am really afraid that i am not there where i should be or i am doing smt wrong that my family hates me its hard to explain but i take more than valerians pill per day cuz i cant deal with ice in my stomach any ideas what it can be,2
im having a very hard time its bad enough that people are staring at me in public with concerned looks on their faces im making total strangers uncomfortable just by my presence,2
im having a hard time right now so i picked up my acoustic guitar and just made more noise than was in my head then i had to just grab a pen and paper this is what came out tomorrows another day but tonight may never come so i sit right here and now and ponder my meaning to this life stru g together like a cats in the cradle string night has coe and im full of misery i dont think ill ever see the sun again my tool box scattered across the ground in disarray ill be leaving this world tho it might not be today but its time for the pain to fade reaching out to the light from my own darkness that no one can see whats it matter if i fade from the light after all its only me i dont have any thoughts of self harm right now i just had soe shit built up and the guitar and the writing on paper and here has made me feel so much better if youre reading just know you have worth youre more valuable on this plane than you know have a happy day and dont forget to be awesome,2
why does my brain know when to be depressedmanic typically i cycle over the course of a few days at most but my psych increased my lamictal so i stopped getting depressed as often and dont really have mood issues unless i get stressed or take caffeine or something ive been burning the candle on both ends recently and i have had frequent and almost constant but relatively mild bursts of energy with only mild dips into normal or depression but i decided to actually get some sleep for once and now the depressive ends are hitting me really hard and the high ends are just me being normal instead of energetic usually i cycle over the course of a day and i am wondering how my brain can remember that so many manic bursts happened last week like is there some part of the brain that counts all my episodes and tells the other parts to be depressed i guess im looking for a more brain psychology answer not like an analysis of my behavior or anything,2
he has no boundaries i tried to get a restraining order and felt bad im codependent and i put his emotional needs before mine he is emotionally and physically abusive he uses my mental illness against me its dangerous to cut him off cold turkey because he harasses and stalks me my family and friends,2
okay so i was a freshman in college this year and i made it until about a month ago before i had to withdraw since my mental health was awful drinking myself to sleep every night going out alone at am not being able to get up and go to class stuff like that i miss my friends so much but i do feel better now that im home and dont have to stress about financial stuff things i worked as much as i could but got burnt out from doing work and school at the same time as pathetic as that sounds i just couldnt afford my meds for a while i dont know what im talking about and im sorry but i think im manic right now im so tired and took a lot of sleep stuff but its not working i feel like i can run a marathon lmao i also managed to convince myself again that no one loves me and that im an awful person but honestly i dont think ive really done anything that bad my mind is just racing and i feel like im gonna freak myself out into having a panic attack im sorry if this is annoying i feel so annoying,2
it feels so fucking stupid how expensive it is to get treatment i also have to get testing done to figure out pain ive been having and was told that the mri would cost me the appointment is at the end of the month just had to reschedule all my follow ups because i cant afford it i just got charged for my therapy and my vraylar too i work at a firm but im underpaid i tried to negotiate but was shot down ive been looking for a better paying job but even then with upcoming medical expenses such a physical therapy pain medications plus all the bipolar stuff vraylar psychiatrist and therapist and bills from a recent surgery im feeling like this paycheck to paycheck type of living is my future again this year i didnt even have enough money for groceries i cant save to move out of my moms house just all of this is doing my mental health worse money doesnt buy happiness but it sure affords piece of mind im stressed and annoyed at my situation and i know im not the only one,2
hey guys im struggling financially atm big time last year i had to take over months off and was in hospital for months due to a very severe episode ive returned to work since then but part time and i cant seem to catch up on the costs of living with my income the craziest thing is that im a doctor registrar speciality training and i still dont make enough to live my partner is supporting me as much as possible but hes struggling too i feel so ashamed and defeated i cant work more currently as i only just increased my hours and the stress and fatigue is full on right now i have no parental support or other supports after graduating med school i finally had financial freedom and was doing well my relapse last year has cost me more than my health and its a real struggle to go back living week to week and paycheck to paycheck ive been poor my entire life apart from when i first graduated is anyone else in the same boat and if so how do you come to terms with it the situation makes me feel like im a failure and i feel really embarrassed hope everyone is doing ok and thanks to this sub,2
thinking about when i was hypomanic one of the hardest things is that looking back on it a lot of the stuff i said and did was really funny i leaned into that a lot at the time and even resorted to fullon clowning and cringe humour cos its always been a defence mechanism for me but underneath i was feeling desperate and really scared because i couldnt stop talking and didnt know what was happening to me i knew i wasnt in control and i thought if i could only make the people around me laugh it would all be ok now its over ive even turned it into a kind of comedy routine but every time i go through it i enjoy the funniness but also cant stop thinking god i was in so much pain can anyone relate,2
i dont know what to add im job searching and my anxiety is through the roof about this it sucks cuz its a great opportunity heres some length since apparently the body has to be longer than the title or it gets removed,2
ive noticed in moments of high emotional stress i start to become unable to speak words are flowing through my head and i feel stuck and just cant get myself to open my mouth to speak sometimes i am just like that until im able to force myself to speak again but ive noticed its been getting really bad recently in my current relationship and im looking to see if this is a common problem for bipolar or if its something else causing it,2
sometimes in a rush i will accidentally take my srqual by mistake in the morning and im usually at work it hits me hard i will usually go home but sometimes i will stay appearing to be drunk takes me all morning to work it through my system until the afternoon after coffee has anyone done this before,2
i was diagnosed when i was im now i have had so many months jobs in the last two years i get bored very quickly and i feel like the work isnt challenging enough i was recently diagnosed as adhd and am medicated for that as well it has still not helped ive been with my current job for months im having the same problem i get paid very well for what is expected of me but theres so much down time hence the boredom does this happen to anyone else and if so how do you combat this feeling,2
someone i really care about is tackling bipolar disorder without medication due to the expense of a psychiatrist hes finally in a place where he can get one but with a long waitlist in his area its difficult its so hard to watch its like im looking in a mirror and just seeing myself years ago when i was at the height of my illness the lashing out volatile nature hopelessness he feels hurts me horribly because i know from experience there is nothing i can do hes either ignoring me or cant leave me alone and i dont blame that on him whatsoever every time he hurts my feelings rn i have to remind myself that years ago i was the same way it just sucks so much to watch someone you care about go through something like this knowing there is so little in support you can offer him and i are so desperate for him to see a psychiatrist and get stable and are waiting anxiously for next week when its finally happening but even then i know it takes a while for the meds to help it just hurts so badly to see someone go through that and knowing exactly the type of pain and anger they are feeling and the helplessness of it,2
i literally can not stay inside for longer than half a day before i feel like my mind is closing on me years ago i isolatedyself in small room for two months literally driving myself nuts physically in my head it wasnt thoughts more about feelings in different parts of brain it use to go away as soon as i went outside but now its been getting worse where i have to stay outside rest of day and comes on too fast clonazepam helps but i havent taken it in two years,2
so its been years like years since ive had a depression that was not a mixed episode id been pretty stable tye past years but my migraines at least thats what my doctor thinks they wre had them for years have been getting worse last year i wound up in the er with one so bad that i went from moving under my own steam to get in the door with the worst pain in my life made running over my foot with a one story tall steel gate feel like kiddy play to needing help into a wheel chair cause i couldnt even stand ive had rounds of blood work all normal a ct scan and mri normal now an oximetry test tuesday night waiting on doctor to interpret the results and an appointment with a neurologist august th soonest they had and required taking a personal day off work cause it wont fit well in my work day theyve never actually gone away even on days i dont record as having one i lowkey always have pain just its at a threshold tolerable enough i can for tye most part ignore it but most days of the week ive got headache andor the front of my brain feels like its being prickled with pins and needles not in pain those thats reserved for my temples and the icepicks behind my eyes it makes my brain mush and makes me feel physically weak but every appointment i have because of that they test for a stroke but i come out normalno stroke and my mind is mush it cant think its way out of a wet paper bag full of holes heck it will even struggle for forum words i just feel so hopeless and empty and broken like a pathetic worthless loser and failure at everything that im not worth shit and between tye two im always exhausted and dont have the energy or will to do things and even when i force myself i feel like im shit at it but im also super irritable and pissy and angry alot so much of the time i could scream and shout but cry and beat myself in the head at the same time i struggling very hard to use my logic and tools to get out from under all this,2
so last year after an attempt i was diagnosed in hospital with bipolar disorder i have been prescribed all the meds and have had continuous appointments with my gp to try and get everything settled and find a good prescription that fits what i need months ago after having a month long manic episode i went back to my gp in the hopes that we can really dial down into what i need skip forward to today and i have a phone appointment with a psych from my area we only have like in my province after asking me approximately questions he determined that i dont have bipolar at all but major depressive disorder and ptsd would you go for a rd opinion at this point i have had clear textbook manic episodes all throughout my life and this psych didnt think i met the requirements to be diagnosed with bipolar so he doesnt believe i should be treated as such and has prescribed mg of zoloft this concerns me as i know antidepressants can lead to manic episodes i would love your advice,2
hi currently i am not diagnosed i hope it does not bother anyone but bipolar type is being suspected by my psychiatrist and i had some doubts im not asking for diagnosis because lately i have been going through dark days but today something extremely strange happened to me that i do not know how to name or explain to my psychiatrist if anyone has felt this way i would appreciate it if you could tell me about your experience please i was talking with a friend about my emotions and i remember that from one moment to the next i got caught up in a specific thought like a delusion and then it was like i had emotionally exploded i felt out of myself i started sobbing very loudly my breathing was heavy i couldnt control or stop myself but it wasnt like the moment or the conversation led me to it because of the intensity it just happened i was hugging myself i couldnt stand him touching me i felt like i was getting small i really have no idea how to explain it but what was most impressive to me was how spontaneous it was and that feeling of not being in control of my own body after that i felt numb and confused,2
ive been to a couple of interviews and i think the interviewers just see into my soul i want to have a job but i cant find one im too eccentric and probably i dont even care if i work or not i feel like they see it whenever we make eye contact they see that i would be a bad employee i dont care about anything at all at this point,2
tw depression nihilism addiction etc hi all im really sorry if this post triggers anybody please dont read if youre prone to being triggered by content relating to depressiondespair with that in mind how the fuck am i supposed to be excited about living the rest of my life im only years old and im so goddamn tired the older i get the more acutely aware i get of just how wrong my brain is i try so hard and it cant be fixed as we all know im on medication but in a few months ill be off my moms insurance and i cannot afford private insurance i know everyone says we need to be on meds and i agree i need to be on meds but staring down the barrel right now i know i cannot and will not be able to just a while from now and i hate this fucking disorder so much because all it does is lie to you i cant trust my happiness or my sadness or my apathy i am genuinely so exhausted of managing these feelings and it gets worse every year as i get more and more compounded adult stress how am i supposed to want to go on like this and no i am not at risk of ending my life i have too much guilt and shame to think of doing that to my family but that just compounds the pain of existing for no reason beyond obligation how do you all do it why do you all do it literally any input or advise or comment is appreciated to help me feel maybe just a little less alone sorry for being so whiny,2
ive been taking lamictal for three years now from the beginning it has been apparent that i am allergic to it a very strange kind of reaction my hands start to burn inside my skin if you touch my hands they are normal temperature and then they start to itch they burn and itch so much i end up putting them under water constantly i started taking some antihistamines with it and ive been ok for three years this med has changed my life like entirely it made me stable able to hold a job and so much more i cant live without it but recently my hands started to itch again slowly i take my antihistamine in the evening im fine all day long the following day and then in the evening it starts to itch again my overall skin as well im worried i will have to stop taking my lamictal it has been wonderful no side effects whatsoever if i stop taking it i wont take any other medication because i dont want to gain weight or hurt my kidneys have any of you gone through something similar with allergies i talked to a pharmacist when i started doing this and they told me i couldnt become resistant to antihistamines im starting to doubt this,2
trigger warning so much sad shit mention of suicide this last two ish years have been the worst of my life starting may my father committed suicide followed by two weeks later my year old cousin this is the third family suicide flash forward to may i drove myself to the hospital fearing id be alone and unable to be safe on the anniversary of his death this is the occasion where i actually learned im bipolar and have been on the wrong meds for years im a f i have lots of beautiful things about my life a husband a dog a ridiculous garden but man i dont know how to not feel completely daunted looking both forward and back and having one really solid year of stability in my brain with various other degrees of stability but lots of struggle just to float how do i not just feel angry and scared that i have to live in this body in this brain with this trauma for the rest of it,2
ive been needing to get my oil changed for the past miles and my headlight has been out for at least a month today i finally got my oil changed my headlights replaced and even changed my car air filters i think ill even get my tabs renewed,2
im not throwing a pity party here i just genuinely want to know if other people have done this too i have spent so much money over the years racked up a lot of debt ive only been stable for the past month or so thankfully to lithium but my monthly expenses are nearly equal to my income i can no longer afford my home that my family currently resides in i am ashamed and embarrassed that i ever let my spending get so bad but i guess thats where being on no medication can hurt you i submitted a loss mitigation application to my mortgage company and got a letter from my psychiatrist stating that ive been diagnosed with bipolar is anyone else in the same boat or have been here before,2
im assuming this is fairly normal with bp but im so sick of dark obsessive ruminating thought patterns even during relative stability it seems like every week its something else deathdying of loved ones someone being hurt losing my partner and awful thoughts of not being good enough to be loved i feel like bp is such a hindrance to me enjoying life fully its like a new obsession every week and im so sick of it,2
i know i see it my life is propelled a mandate from heaven audience anticipates it they clap until it sounds like thunder grasping their bellies until they roll out of their chairs hes doing it again another meltdown born and grew with a face of a child youre so cute seems peculiar but i sure found something for my phenotype they pay for my dinners they buy me flowers made me feel secure when i was not stable i like to be treated like to be shown you care then i feel intolerable and have been called things for a previous lifestyle maybe i am what i am told i am what brings admiration and material turns to my curse for when i fall apart and turn to a spectacle it is something to merely laugh at frustration and cries for help get treated as hysterical suicidal ideation and attempts get treated as mere pouts nothing that serious even more certain i have no right to myself,2
asking to be hopeful because im sure im going through mania right now and i was only out of depression for like weeks before this hit i really hope theres a chance i wont flip back there im still trying to get my habits back in place that i fell out of and really cant afford to be screwed with depression for another weeks,2

im not always sad during my low phases but during them i often have middling energy and take numerous naps which almost border on narcolepsy recently ive been reorganizing my house but i feel held back because i have errands to run in town and feel too tired to do so this is compounded by my being proactive into march until i had two breakdowns weeks ago and sleeping off my problems might be a possible coping method much of this has had me recall my first year of high school where i was deeply depressed and often slept during and after school whereas i was highly energetic and consistently worked in my junior and senior years does anyone else here have similar experiences,2
i cant tell if its placebo or not but i already feel slightly more productive finally got around to renewing my library card ive been meaning to for the past weeks but got discouraged when i had called on a day they were closed and didnt feel like doing it even when i knew they were open im also playing more of my video games even though it was only games its still a huge step for me im excited to see my hobbies come back hopefully ill finally go outside on a walk on my own eventually its been a few years im also taking lithium which used to work for my depression ive pretty much been taking only lithium for the past years and never thought id see the day i add another pill im glad i wasnt scared about taking something new either,2
so i shared in my first post here that my dr put me on latuda to help control my bpd symptoms i went days with it nothing major had the hypersalivation thats listed and some good sleep finally then my body seemed to betray itself violently getting sick to the point of dehydration and muscle cramps that took surgical grade narcotics to calm my body down from turns out i am that have a sensitivity to one of the ingredients in the medicine i have now been switched to vraylar tonight is day hopefully it helps silence the million voices in my head and lets me sleep and keeps me from having any violent side effects sorry if im just rambling on ive noticed this is one of the safer places to talk about these things without judgement or being approached by the internet drs,2
lamotrigine started giving me a rash amp now i have to go to the er during finals week amp yea lamotrigine helped me get out of bed but thats it im still depressed but enough to do anything about it bad or good im just here im probably better off not on my meds so im flushing everything,2
i was recently switched from latuda which was free with my insurance i was switched to lurasidone for some reason and its theres no way i can actually afford this and im doing so well its just so upsetting i dont know what to do,2
taking a day off work for the second week in a row i am not over on sick days or anything but i still feel like my manager is going to start asking questions white collar field i think my depression stems from the fact i got passed up for a promotion i was promised last week have lost all motivation to work for this firm i can feel myself slipping into a depressive episode sigh i hate navigating the professional world,2
i randomly get this overwhelming feeling of deep disgust when i get reminded i have a functioning body full of organs and tissue etc and i get this urge to just rip out everything ive come close to it once but im usually around people since i lack any privacy anywhere which im not complaining to a extent but i had this same breakdown in front of my new bf and couldnt stop crying i tried to explain the fear and disgust but he was super freaked out and couldnt understand i dont understand it myself i just recently signed up for therapy again since ive noticed more frequent episodes but therapy doesnt give me answers why i feel this way and i im constantly asking myself questions and it causes migraines frequently my brain is so fried at this point i feel like its just lying to me constantly,2
i get shaky due to nerves and ptsd from time to time but ive started to notice after my visit to my therapist office that im extremely shaky even though i feel fine anyone else experience this,2
i was diagnosed with bipolar in december after my first major manic episode that ended in hospitalization since then i have been taking my medication hydroxyzine and abilify up until about a month ago i dont like the sedated feeling medication gives me and i feel abilify takes away the flare of my personality i have been stable up until this week and i feel a depressive episode coming its a extremely unique feeling that is so recognizable to me i am losing all motivation and joy in my life is there anything i can do to prepare for this and any advice on what i can do to do the least damage to my life as possible,2
i know many of us question our diagnosis but its more difficult when youve had a manic episode with delusions but sometimes i can still talk myself into believing the diagnosis isnt real and that those werent delusions i thought it was a spiritual awakening when it was happening and that i was one with god and had to save humanity anyway dae whos had mania with delusions sometimes doubt their diagnosis,2
ive asked a question to you guys in the past regarding the end goal of being medicated im on mg of lithium carbonate mg divalproex and mg bupropion hcl xl every other day ive noticed a good improvement on this cocktail most recently upped the dose of lithium to mg and i felt like i was doing better but its been months and ive had episodes since the increasethese episodes are usual at this time of year so it didnt cause them but theyre still there a bit more manageable and definitely not ruining my life like before but i do not feel like a normal functioning human being im still experiencing mania but im able to stop myself from spending excess money and i am able to notice the energy im expending so i can force myself to relax here and there so im not deprived i still sleep less but enough to function so thats good i cant stop myself from picking up my phone and googling everything on the planet that comes to mindi feel like i have add or something literally no focus at all which is not good for work i still have significant periods of anxiety and stress about nothing and im finding this hard to manage and the depression is still there but my body no longer feels like cement although im usually tired even after sleeping hrs i can still force myself to get up and do stuff like clean shower etc but im extremely miserable about it and everything else that doesnt involve sleeping i dont cry omw to work during work and while showering anymore i dont have those scary thoughts anymore and i can keep a gym schedule although during my depressive periods the amount of gym sessions i get in are significantly less is this it or should i keep trying to find a better state to be in i mean i can live with it but it sucks to go through this rollercoaster of emotions and energy expending and depleting even if its just a midsized one i cancel a lot of plans on friends often because the way i feel when making them is not how i feel when the date arrives i still have these insane urges to make plans with people and go out and socialize shop google search like mad and try new stuff i still sleep less and more depending on what stage im in i still overstress over everything and panic i still feel drained and prefer to be alone and do nothing for a month or so straight i should add that before increasing the lithium my dr suggested lamictal but the potential deadly rash side effect and the interaction with birth control pills terrified me so i decided to go with the lithium increase,2
im coming to terms with the fact that im not a good fit for my field of study its deliriously stressful and triggers episodes without fail ive always been ambitious and driven to succeed but while job hunting im realizing that i want and need to go at a slower pace my memory aint what it used to be and the cognition aint the same my job came home with me i went to bed and woke up with it on top of having a family i havent worked in nearly a year and half due to burnout anyone else experience being happier withless i think id be happy stocking shelves at this point,2

ive been diagnosed bipolar for years now im i put diagnosed in quotes because i had to come to the conclusion to my therapist and doctor and they just put me on antipsychotics and mood stabilizers my aunt had bipolar and is on disability i just cant accept it though sometimes i get upset and have really bad days and sometimes i make a shit ton of art i feel great im cleaning like a mother fucker and i feel untouchable for a few days when in a good mood i dont have trouble sleeping but i can run off of hours of sleep no prob i know i crash though i fall deep into depression and contemplate doing the worst im off medications and ive been through therapists because i end up hating them ive been through case managers because the first one was an idiot and wanted me to fill out paper work with her at a library which made me uncomfortable as hell my second case manager im on smi serious mental illness under being approved by the state as such so my second case manager didnt get back to me for two weeks so im a rage im in the process of changing facilities to get services from i have no friends absolutely none i constantly fight with my boyfriend he calls me a psychopath because i dont feel empathy im starting to think that there isnt really any hope to get better for me to be on medication for the rest of my life on antipsychotics that make me fatso and feel like im passing out yay sounds like a life worth living for sure lol therapy isnt working my last therapist tried to report me for being suicidal and she never wanted to talk about my trauma she instead would talk about herself and her wife maam i dont care about you or your life im the problem and people dont want to deal with you when they find out your bipolar thats what ive learned i cant accept that im bipolar something non my brain tells me im just broken from abuse i dont know anymore im sober for years and life is worse,2

god i hate this feeling i woke up after just a few hours of sleep cleaned my bathroom and kitchen did laundry vacuumed and did a lil workout i felt so energized and full of electricity but then everything just crashed and now im just laying in bed feeling all depressed and anxious i started taking my meds again ran out of them and was raw dogging life for about a month so i shouldnt feel this way right i have to leave for work in an hour and just cant get up,2
so ive been on lamictal for like years on and off its been the only med thats actually worked for me but something ive noticed that ive never really discussed with anyone because its never actually been a serious problem is the insane dreams it causes me to have i know for a fact its the lamictal because all the times ive gone off it the dreams stop when i go back on it they start up again they are so vivid i always remember every detail none of them make sense or have any deeper meaning sometimes theyre just weird but other times theyre scary which is fine because i know its just a dream but it does rattle me anyway just curious if this is a common thing anyone else have weird ass lamictal dreams,2

im going apologize ahead for punctuation but i will try i am m luckily been married to a wonderfully patient woman for years my entire life i have messed everything up including a military career and thought it was just who i am i have been in and out of hospitals and thought everyone else was crazy i have been diagnosed and accept that i am bipolar but i dont want it to define me its hard when i hear people around me say that explains so much how do i keep from bipolar becoming who i am,2
i dont know why im like this i love my partner more than anything and i cant think rationally i cant communicate well im so scared that theyre plotting against me or theyre going to get tired of my episodes and break up with me or find me just so so unbearable i cant even ask for help from them because how am i meant to say this in a way that will show them that i love them and im not accusing them and im not crazy and i just want to have control over myself and my emotions and my thoughts i just want to feel happy i want to stop making everyone miserable i want to be in on the joke that everyone else around me is in on i feel so scared and angry and confused,2
sorry if this has already been talked about a lot but i just realized that this is why i dont like making plans too far out into the future one of my friends recently asked me if i wanted to go to a concert in august i love the musician and im sure id enjoy the show but my initial honest reaction was i dont even know who ill be by then i didnt say that out loud but it was a clarifying moment does anyone else have this issue probably an added unwanted effect is that this makes me come across as flaky disorganized or unreliable and im not saying im definitively not those things bums me out though i can use a calendar app i swear i just do not know how ill be feeling a month from now and a bunch of my friends are very type a so it sort of compounds the issue because they love having full calendars and planning hangs weeks in advance dorks anyway i think ill buy tickets to this thing even if i dont end up being able to go its just annoying i have to incorporate this into my decisionmaking i can barely rsvp to weddings with any degree of confidence thats all thanks edit thanks for the comments everyone helped me feel less alone about it,2

so i usually dont post anything on reddit but here we go about eight months ago i was diagnosed with bp ive struggled with mental health issues all my life anxiety depression and developed ptsd at a pretty young age after a few years of fluctuating emotions i went to see a psychologist and i got my diagnosis i was also diagnosed with aspergers syndrome back in ive been on a mood stabilizer lamictal since i was diagnosed and its made things easier for me but exam season last year of high school is coming up and i lowkey feel like im losing my mind im experiencing mixed moods every other week i cant really sleep anymore and every day im torn between ignoring everyone around me freaking out or acting friendly because i know i shouldnt take my own mental illness out on anyone im either tired stressed occasionally productive or filled with a kind of selfloathing and sadness that i cant even begin to describe im worried ill be thrown straight into a depressive episode soon because stress is my biggest trigger very few people two of my friends and my immediate family know that im bipolar and i dont even want to tell them about how i feel right now i think a lot of people on here can relate to that crushing feeling that youre a burden to your loved ones even when they tell you youre not i considered the possibility that things might get better if i told someone but i just dont have the energy and i dont want to let people in because im ashamed that im losing control explaining how i feel to someone is difficult aspergers yay and there arent many people i trust with my emotions the people i trust are the ones i dont want to burden i wanted to ask does it get any easier not to board the selfpity train or anything but im not even and thinking about the future terrifies me i dont want to fall apart and fake that im okay every time a problem arises i dont want to isolate myself because im scared of affecting people i dont want to experience all these episodes over and over again i just dont know what to do right now also if anyone has any advice on how to keep going and staying productive id really appreciate it lt,2
i took yalls advice started taking my meds quit cocaine in a much better head space weeks clean thank you i knew what to do but needed to be told to do it edit i also got a job,2
does anyone else experience these in spurts ive seen research that says it could be a manic episode coming on i havent remembered my dreams in a while but ive had a bad one every night the past four days they always happen right before i wake up,2
i know ive had at least one episode of what was probably psychosis because i was diagnosed with stress induced psychosis when it was happening i dont know if that one was bipolar related or not and i wasnt treated with anything at the time because i was still quite young and the psychiatrist didnt want to intervene with medication however ive had other symptoms since during what were probably undiagnosed manic or mixed episodes where ive started to believe things that were retrospectively pretty weird occasionally these beliefs also pop up when im very very depressed sometimes i believe these things unquestioningly and other times i know they dont make sense but worry about them excessively anyway sometimes it fluctuates between the two a common one for me is worrying that other people can hear my thoughts especially if i look at them directly i also get concerns about people working against me or talking about me behind my back to try to ruin my life another time i became convinced my childhood home was haunted and that a demon had followed me from there into my daily life i kept seeing a figure in my room at night and i worried about speaking about him out loud in case he came for me i still worry about this sometimes and tbf im pretty sure that house really was haunted my childhood friends and i talk about the weird slightly paranormal stuff that happened there so im not alone with that but my sudden obsession with it was abnormal i told a different psychiatrist about those two a while back and he said it was probably due to a combination of autism and trauma and that it would likely go away with more emdr since they kind of just left as my mood changed he was satisfied that his therapy had worked i had another one where i decided i was actually naturally nocturnal and that other people were interfering with that to purposefully make me sick and stop my plans i completely flipped my sleep schedule for several weeks although admittedly i wasnt sleeping very much anyway and then fought with all my family and friends about it at one point i also became very worried that other dog walkers were all talking about me on facebook and were plotting to take my dog away another time i was certain i was dying of some horrible illness and all the medical professionals i saw werent treating me on purpose because they wanted me to die i really was sick though but the level of paranoia was weird i was still somewhat functional while all of these were happening and i wasnt hearing voices or anything for the most part so does it really count as anything serious because it didnt seem that bad to me and my family just kind of ignored it since theyd been told that the episodes were stress related and it was best not to engage ive never told a psychiatrist about all of the thoughts because i didnt view them as relevant until recently i just thought they were a part of life and it was something i did when i got stressed tldr at what point does it cross the line into actual psychosis vs being paranoid and having weird thoughts im going to be starting medication for the first time soon if all goes well my current psychiatrist is talking about putting me on antipsychotics but idk if these episodes are really bad enough to warrant taking an antipsychotic ive been reading about the drugs and they sound like heavy duty stuff and i cant tell if for me its really necessary i think id rather try another type of mood stabilising medication first i dont know how i feel about all of this,2
title says it all i dont have any friends noone everywhere i go people dont like me i snapchat a couple people yeah but when it comes down to it i dont actually have anyone to hang out with or really talk to i have my boss so i have one person but its not the same like say i had to have surgery tomorrow and needed a ride home i can guarantee noone would be willing yet id be there for them at the drop of a hat im miserable and im lonely and i just wish that people actually liked me enough to actually interact with me on a deeper level than just sending a picture of their face all the time with almost no dialog i dont ever know what to talk about and i dont want to just always talk about me because ill feel like im just conceited but thats what other people talk about and they have friends and so i just dont know what im doing wrong im tired of it,2
does anyone else experience psychosis i heard it was a symptom of bipolar disorder but the link between psychosis and bipolar is only when a person is manic i experience psychosis in both ways but mostly when im depressive states is it normally a part of bipolar or is that an another issue altogether,2
so yesterday i was feeling manic it was a warm sunny day i even got a new learning obsession and today i woke up like meh and i am feeling sleepy even though i have slept for hours also because i didnt respond on yesterdays evening to somebody when i felt like i should and now everything is not the way it should be my ocd i might actually deserve all of this,2
hi there its me again i hope youre doing good im grrrreat im just writing with that sample you requested which i will leave in the attachments i hope you like it i was kinda going for something different this time if it still needs improvements let me know and if i cant get it right this time then guess ill die womp womp womp lol anyway theres was something i was specifically writing to tell you about but i forgot should i remember it be expecting another email from me now if you will excuse me im off to shave my legs in the front yard as its a lovely day have a bitchin wednesday and looking back at old emails its just pages of this shit,2
also i finally slept may have only been hours but ill take it,2
antone have gastroparesis an bipolar what medications are you able to take without them getting you sick my psychiatrist wants me on lamotrigine an remon known as mirtazapine hes only putting me on one antidepressant because of my lack of sleep at night an thats my mania,2
i was spending time with a friend today felt totally normal and good in the conversation im very close to her and feel very comfortable then one of our other friends came over that im still comfortable with but not as comfortable and i noticed it wasnt as easy for me it felt like i was trying so hard to be present that i wasnt present like i was putting so much energy into having energy and smiling and being engaged but i wasnt i felt off weird and robotic i feel like this happens a lot to me whenever i hang out with other people who arent my usual group of friends even if i am comfortable with them or even sometimes in group settings when i cant keep up with the energy of the group or my energy is too big in the group but not so much one on one any idea why this is happening to me is this masking,2
i just saw something that really affected me and emotion consumed me i immediately wanted to harm myself are all our emotions stronger than others or am i dramatic and only experience clinically strong emotions in episodes,2
can consent for sexual acts be given during psychotic manic episodes visual hallucinations seeing other peoples faces on different people auras around people massive delusions euphoria etc involved how debilitated must one be to not be able to give consent,2
long story short i had to leave a job after only six months because of a medicine induced manic episode and subsequent diagnosis so it doesnt look so bad like i just quit a job i actually did turn in a two week notice could i use the bipolar or just general mental health issue as my reasons with recruiters and hiring managers just wondering if anyone else has been through this because im sure im not alone,2
so this is related to bipolar medication im on mg er quetiapine i take it every night however i had to pull an all nighter for class so i misses the dose last night however i get symptoms if i dont take the quetiapine at the same time each night so i had to take it in the morning because i started getting symptoms basically i dont think i can even get to class right now because im so out of it normally i sleep after taking it so i forgot how crazy the side effects can be especially because i havent have food in awhile so do i go to lab in this zombie state or tell my professor im sick and miss lab while probably inconveniencing everyone who have helped me lots this semester and been very accommodatingim worried too bc it would mess up my lab schedule and my report is due in a week but i dont think i can go out an d function right now,2
this is obviously a joke why are therapies so expensive i acknowledge that therapists work hard to be qualified but my insurance barely covers it the relief i feel after every session is counteracted by the anxiety for the amount on the invoice i wish i could get the help i need without having to sacrifice half of my paycheck,2
im new to this sub so let me first thank you all for this wealth of information you all have been so kind to share like the title says my friend feels as though she has been bullied and ostracized from her fellow coworkers since coming forward with her bipolar diagnosis who can we turn to that will advocate for her rights,2
so i have been feeling pretty down the past few weeks it could be a lot of things that triggered it however i did recently start taking birth control for pcos im beginning to wonder if they can have an effect on our moods im still taking all my other medicine but i cant shake this feeling of sadness and exhaustion,2
hey everyone to start im a year old female living in the united states i come from a family that has a close history of bipolar and adhd my grandfather has pretty severe bipolar and due to his refusal to fake traditional medication hes an addict and has been separated from my family since i was a child ive shown signs of being bipolar for a very long time now was diagnosed with adhd got on the meds for that but still struggled significantly i knew everything i was experiencing pointed to bipolar ii but with it being so taboo in my family after my grandpas actions i refused to ever admit it however now after talking with my psychiatrist he strongly believes i am bipolar and we will start a more in depth diagnosis beginning soon i have mixed feelings ive known that this was most likely the answer but i didnt want it to be true i hate that i have to be the one in my family to carry the bipolar role i know they will look down on me and assume ill end up the same way that my grandpa did,2
ive been researching trust issues and coping mechanisms and an article i read brought up bipolar disorder and how trust issues can be indicative of bipolar i have a lovely partner but i cant scrape it from me to trust him no fault of his own he has done nothing to betray my trust how have you trusted healthy partners after the bad ones im trying very hard not to ruin this but alas i keep waiting for the other shoe to drop,2
ill start when im down mash the nostalgia and predictability classic style characters are comforting for me when im up the simpsons im really familiar and can keep it on in the background while doing something else or leave and come back without issue,2
im just wondering if anyone has any tips for coping with extreme self loathing im medicated and in therapy but neither of these things seem to help when the self hatred hits me hard i guess this would be considered a depressive episode but i dont really get manic anymore so who really knows i just hate myself so much that it makes me suicidal i wish i was someone else entirely or that i just didnt exist ive hated myself for most of my life probably since puberty and realizing i didnt look like the other girls and i was weird i never fit in i was always overweight and not conventionally pretty thru out my teen years i made so many bad choices drop out ex junkie then teen mom such an undesirable life i cant even fathom how anyone could possibly love me stupid crazy ugly failure me im years old and i still feel like that little outcast kid that no one cared about can anyone relate did anything work for you,2
is your depressive episode caused by specific life event triggering event or flow of time and biological cycle ampxb ampxb ampxb mine is caused by specific life event triggering event and idk how other people go thru depressive episodes i am recently diganosed my doc was confused about my symptoms and tracked me for a long time and i want to be educated ampxb ampxb thank you so much and hope yall have a good day,2
weed man i dont get withdrawals when i stop or anything i just struggle so bad with controlling it i promised myself id take this week off of smoking and from here on out at least taking days off a week but ive already smoked times this week its the only fucking thing that keeps my moods under control when im home as my family is extremely toxic i dont want this to turn into my old habits,2
just diagnosed after coming down from a hypomanic episode that resulted in a lot of binge drinking is alcohol out of the question for someone like me i am starting medication tomorrow and while i know i have a problem i am hoping i can still participate in the occasional weddingbirthday champagne toast,2
id really love to hear from other women who have bipolar and went ahead with having kids how is that going for you do you enjoy being a mom is it manageable im a woman in my early s and got married last year it feels like everyone around me is having babies and im really trying to figure out if i want one i feel like i could be happysad either way i just started listening to an audio book about trying to decide about kids and i had to turn it off because it was making me cry my husband is sort of happy to go with whatever decision i make i know nobody is making me make this decision but i dont want to hit and just say oops guess i never did that i really just want to make up my mind either way,2
long story short after a very difficult few months and then the death of a friend i am not doing well my therapist is asking that i seek a higher level of care which i am pursuing hoping for an iop group spot to open up soon i do know the er is there if things get too serious before then but im trying to avoid that if possible i think i can finally admit that a lot of my thoughts lately are suicidal not sure why i couldnt say that for so long but the fog has lifted enough that its become clear i havent felt this sick in nearly years since before my bipolar ii diagnosis i have no intention of acting on those thoughts but they are there nearly constantly but the weird thing is my anxiety suddenly disappeared recently i dont feel normal or free from anxiety almost like the anxiety left and was replaced by a strange calm apathy i no longer fear death and i havent noticed myself feeling nervous about anything it feels almost like when the anxiety left it almost gave the suicidal thoughts permission to be there im not scared anymore its been a weird feeling and i guess im curious if anyone else has felt something like this it feels confusing and i think im trying to make sense of it,2
im m from brazil and fortunately we have not the best health care provide by a government but its something so on im been diagnosed as bipolar a years ago a now a new doctor that met in last december took my case and i feelling she is doing her best to help me im taking lithium mg depakene mg rivotril mg if panic attacks ou a huge anxiety crisis and plus zolpidem mg for sleep we started very low i tried a few days only with lithium and it puts me in a major depression then we started depakene kind help but im still feeling stuck in my depressive cycle my question to all of you is how long did you take meds until your stability i swear i cant hold on anymore i want be the person i used to be have a job have some dreams take care of my appearance etc tab is so fucking unfair how i hate tab,2
i began taking lamotrogine days ago and ive been looking for any changes ive seen in myself ever since then i notice that i do feel a little more disciplined or maybe even stable but im unsure whether or not im just having a good week or its the medication my doctor said i would likely feel a difference in four weeks so im keeping that in mind but i just wanted to see what everyone elses experience with the medication was,2
i should give it up right because im kind of agitated amped up now and i should already be asleep ideas for helping to calm down go to sleep tell me all about your experiences with caffeine and coffee fellow bipolar people one of the trains of thought running through my head right now is in my own language gibberish which makes me think maybe i cant blame this all on coffee lmao,2
maybe this is just me but ive noticed two types of mania i experience that ive dubbed empty mania and full mania empty mania which im currently in in case this is illegible is like im floating and everythings hilarious and but i also begin to dissociate and question whether im realanything around me is real full mania is like my body is too heavy and too alive and im too irritable to socialize with most people without snapping at them and its almost like my body is too big for my skin if that makes sense and i feel everyones eyes staring into my toobig body again maybe thats just me but its helped me be able to better track my moods like this,2
last night as i laid down to sleep and had my eyes closed i had something that felt like a dream but it was something that happened just before i feel asleep i lucidly thinking about the experience as it was happening ill start off with what i think it was i think it was a new kind of suicidal ideation im not religious at all but this dreamlike feeling was full of images that felt like a type of beautiful afterlife like a heaven or something it was sweeping land and seascapes that looked like something off of an asia album cover everything was iridescent and i was flying high above it all loftily and effortlessly it felt like the scenes from the lost boys when you see the vampires pov as they fly it looked so real and so perfect and peaceful and i felt like it was calling me to it i began to speak to it i said please if this is it please take me please take me away from this usually if i have si its miserable and darkly depressing it felt like the si was being cunning and alluring this time,2
its the only symptom i dont experience with hypomania its actually the oppositei am so high strung and hyperfixated on so many things that i completely forget about sex i am not asexual in any way but the idea is just so unappealing during my episodes ive never seen anyone share this sentiment and am left wondering if its really that uncommon,2
hi i got diagnosed medicated back in november currently on mg lamotrigine my mood swings have slowed down however ive been noticing ive been more depressed as of late and going onto day of feeling like this im currently unsure if its because im not on the right meds or the amount of pressure im under rn i feel horrible bc i havent been going to any of my college classes these past weeks i have also not been completing assignments which is also bringing me down i just dont have the energy for it rn the stress im under is due to my grades dropping and the possibility of me losing my full ride scholarship we went on spring break and i was the happiest ive ever been wo being manic once school kicked in ive been sleeping in all day i really think my episode is due to stress rather than my meds but god it sucks so badly it just reminds me of how bad my episodes used to be idk anymore im feeling so miserable and useless i wish i could get back on my feet but it feels impossible,2
im on amisulpride mg valproate gm and lamotrigine mg but for a week or so i have this feeling of dread and frustration related to work which makes me not able to go to work i very well know that its an irrational fear but i cant get over the strong emotion pulling me from attending work ive tried dbt which hasnt helped its starting to become frustrating now worse still is ive had these episodes since the past few months so much so that ive been to work on and off and not consistently i work as a doctor in a large hospital has anyone else felt this way and what has helped yall to get out of it is it part of depression or am i doing this to myself sometimes i doubt this too,2
this sucks i feel like a stranger it feels like everyone has stronger or more intense symptoms than i do my therapist keeps telling me that labels arent everything and that she treats the individual not the diagnosis it made me feel like crap when she said that like the diagnosis the name the labels i always chased to get that sense of validation were all meaningless and now i keep thinking that something is wrong with me but maybe its not bp my psychiatrist is tapering me off lexapro and will be adding lamotrigine soon i am week on wellbutrin she wouldnt be doing this is there wasnt something actually on the bipolar spectrum right,2
you arent your thoughts you just experience them just like how we have mental illness but we arent the illness its a disease just like cancer you dont see cancer patients saying i am cancer they say they have cancer i think saying im bipolar makes it seem like im saying that its my identity i remind myself all the time that bipolar is not an identity its just a journey that im on a journey that is different than anyone elses,2
i guess you could say ive done a lot in my lifetime but i feel like ive just failed a lot before i was diagnosed i was on the fast track to be a lawyer at that didnt happen and now i am divorced and jobless with a useless bachelors degree i cant take classes at my community college because i cant afford them i cant take university classes because ive dropped classes so many times they wont give me financial aid i have terrible credit and i am deep in credit card personal and student loan debt i try getting jobs but dont stay at them for more than a few months i just cant bring myself to do things i dont want to do even if its something i need to do to survive i will still just quit thats why im in such a bad spot i dont know what to do with my life people say just get a flexible parttime job doing easy stuff but if i dont enjoy it i will literally quit two months in my parents have been supporting me my entire life even when i was married my ex was a loser i feel so bad for them to have this failure of a child im not eligible for disability because i havent worked enough hours and im not eligible for ssi because my parents provide me with everything not that i could live off of either of those anyways im so frustrated with myself im not sure if i have any hopes or dreams left i dont know if i need advice or just to vent but here i am,2
i was reading the post about crapping on coping mechanisms that was posted recently and i was surprised to hear that many people consider themselves neurodivergent because of their bipolar please inform me if i sound really ignorant i was under the impression that neurodivergence is an innate difference in thinking permeating everything you do and the brain is inherently wired differently this is most often associated with adhd and autism spectrum disorders i personally feel that although i have a mental illness that when well controlled and stable i am wired the same as most people my therapist described an allegory that stuck for me which was your personality is the climate and your mood is the weather i think that my climate is neurotypical and i do not identify myself as neurodivergent more as someone who deals with periods of mental illness what do you think about this,2
then i come home to a sink full of dishes a carpet that hasnt been vacuumed in ages piles of clothes that havent been folded cups and cans everywhere and the list just goes on i want to have a clean cozy home with house plants that im proud to show off to people but i dont even feel capable of holding myself together for long enough to achieve anything close i feel like a disaster of a human and i dont know how to help myself,2
guess my brain candy days worth suplements for the vegan on to,2
i just got my annual bill and i used a fifth less water than previous years since november ive been showering very little at one point it got so bad i wouldnt shower for days so yeah that saved a lot of water lol doesnt make up for all the money i spent during hypomania that came after but its still nice haha,2
f here hi all here we go a few months ago i had my first manic hypomanic episode it lasted months well after all of the weird behavior i was urged to see a psychiatrist and then i was diagnosed ever since being diagnosed and given medication my first time ever taking daily meds i feel somewhat at unease even though i have a weird feeling right now i feel pretty stable and happy i honestly didnt know medicine could change my life so much but i feel like after experiencing my first manic episode something in me has changed even when im feeling stable theres some underlying feeling my mood may swing at any given moment i am still working on finding the best meds for me so maybe that may have something to do with it i dont know did you guys experience something similar after your first manichypomanic episode did the underlying unease ever go away sorry if i said anything wrong i feel like there is still so much i dont know about bipolar i had a greataunt who was in and out of hospitals in her s for being bipolar but she was shunned from the family from being addicted to drugs and leaving her kids any time i try to ask about herher bipolar diagnosis i get shut down i am lowkey afraid to google about it so all i know really is from what my psychiatrist has told me which is a lot with diagrams and everything it was just a lot to take in,2
i am f and i have bipolar type i forgot my meds for two days and it triggered a depressive episode and im so pissed at myself because i thought i was doing good im so upset i hate how it always ends back in this crazy headspace i know its the bipolar but ohmygod this shit sucks so bad i have to live my whole life with these random episodes of shit im tired sorry i am ranting i just want a break for a year or something id do anything for relief from this disorder at this point,2
since i started taking medsyear ago this last six months is where i consider myself truly stable but i still get sometimes some ups and downs that i feel isnt normal if u know what i mean so and sometimes im self aware of intrusive thoughts and i try to reason with myself somehow but my mood still is affected by it reading some stories shared here i started to wonder what stable mean for each individual and how often do you feel stable but you think am i really i think every person with bipolar eventually will ask questions about what is part of their personality and what is the disease for lack of better word and i often think about the past and wonder was it that truly myself how bad i felt how good when i was depressed when i felt awesome and thought i could have accomplished big things when i felt that i didnt fit anywhere and nothing was worthing pursuing thelist goes on share your thoughts with me people,2
i dont even have it bad except for mental illness obviously yet being awake is so fucking stressful i have a supportive family a great boyfriend good friends etc but i still want to be dad im on wellbutrin buspar vraylar and klonopin and im still depressed anxious and emotional i get they arent a cure all and id be much worse off meds but whats the point if i still cant function in life i cant work a normal job but i keep getting turned down for disability even though i over qualify i fucking need money to live a life i dont even want and i cant get it im about to explode,2
like the title said im starting work on my thesis monday however my school platform where we have access to grading criteria templates general information about the whole thing is currently having technical issues and i cant access anything my teacher said well look into it tomorrow but im panicking in a few hours itll be fixed but it feels so far away what if theres something wrong and im not registered what if theres been a mistake and i cant start my thesis ive already done all the preparation i worked hard to get permission to do my research at a company im really eager to work for and i would die of shame if i had to contact them to tell them i wouldnt be able to do the work as planned my thoughts are spiralling its almost midnight here and im too wound up to go to sleep so ill be exhausted tomorrow even if i do manage to get some sleep im terrified this will trigger an episode im just so scared right now how do i get through this its only weeks left of my bachelors what if i fall apart right before the finish line,2
ive been diagnosed adhd for years and refused treatment years later and i need treatment for depression and mania and it feels like my adhd is no longer able to be managed i just wanna know will treatment help with the procrastination and feeling overwhelmed by everything will i be better than what i was before if you need dual treatment what changes did you and those around you notice,2
starting this off by establishing that i am autistic and one of my interests is self categorization this can make me come across as a hypochondriac or doctor shopper as i know my disordersillnesses very well once i started seeking treatment for my bipolar i learned everything there was to learn joined communities such as this one and started talking to others with bipolar as a result of this i learned a lot about medication not even really on purpose learning about the meds people are on is just an inevitable of being in a group like this my psyche prescribed me abilify today and out of curiosity i asked if that was the med known to sometimes lead to tardive dyskinesia im not against trying abilify all meds can have horrible side effects but i wanted to know if thats what i was potentially getting myself into i love my psyche shes super nice and receptive but she sorta laughed and told me to stop googling your medication which rubbed me the wrong way its a drug im unfamiliar with should i not want to be prepared for the potential risks ive told her before im open to trying anything so its not like i was telling her i wouldnt take it because i was scared i was just asking a question so i know what to look out for im not gonna stop seeing her because this is such a small thing but am i overreacting by feeling a bit icked out,2
tldr should i read choice theory or should i change therapists so my therapist has suggested that i read choice theory by william glasser i used a credit on audible to get it it is a little over hours long i havent started it yet but what i have read about choice theory tells me i will disagree with a main premise which my therapist and i kinda got into today he insists that thoughts and emotions are choices going so far as to say that mental illness is a choice in regards to bipolar if you are not having negative consequences do you have bipolar because you can choose your actions and reactions and emotions and thoughts that medicine is a crutch and is not necessary he says that this gives you the power to control your life and swings and even get rid of swings this came up when i was asking about tools because my regular tool for dealing with intrusive thoughts isnt really cutting it for me right now having the thought then saying to myself is this thought beneficialusefulhelpful to me there are several things here that i am in complete disagreement with medicine is necessary thoughts and emotions are not controllable ie they just happen but can potentially be directed and mental illness is real and not a choice sure you can do things to help mitigate symptoms and try and improve yourself but i am pretty sure i will always have bipolar he has planted a seed of doubt that my entire array of health issues might be psychosomatic i also see gastroneurocardiologists it is incredibly invalidating,2
title says it i love all of your humor your strengths your obstacles all of it i realized its helping me view myself as a real person and accept my own ups and downs as well so thanks for sharing your lives internet strangers,2
does anyone else have holes in their memory from specific hypomania andor depressive episodes when family have brought up situations where i was manic or depressed i generally have very little to no recognition of what theyre talking about and it usually takes a lot of detailing to get me to vaguely remember please tell me im not alone its a little scary,2

i went to my pcp weeks ago for a follow up and was describing what i like to call god mode when i can do anything have unlimited energy basically feel like i could fight god and win vs the times i get so depressed i cant do anything except lay in bed and doomscroll she said that it sounds like manic episodes and depressive episodes i like my names better and started me on lamotrigine my last therapist also said i have bipolar but she was also a quack and i have no idea how she was allowed to become a therapist i did a few days in grippy sock jail after going through several months of god mode until god nerfed me i did the bad and they said that all i had was major depressive disorder and anxiety i guess i just dont know what to think or what to do,2

a week and a half ago i was diagnosed with hepatitis c a deadly virus that costs about to cure i work an entry level retail job and cant afford it this diagnosis caused me to go from feeling on top of the world and stable to actively wanting to die feeling that nobody wants me around or loves me and splitting on everyone around me today i told the people im close to that im suicidal and then i blocked them all i dont want relationships anymore i always let people down and i dont feel like anybody needs me i genuinely dont want to be close to anyone again because either i get let down or i let them down or i push them away its only going to be a matter of time before i am fired from my job and im homeless i dont have any food as i dont have a car or a way to get it and im miserable ive been writing letters if you get what im saying and ive been planning things out in my head i feel like this isnt something i can pull myself out of even if i did manage to start feeling better id still me an unwanted outcast with a deadly contagious virus i hate myself i hate my life,2
hi friends sorry if this is the wrong place to post i f was diagnosed with bd back around october so still fairly recent i am super lucky to have a family that encourages me to keep going to therapy and stay on medication however im finding they dont really understand what im going through while im aware theres no real way for them to conceptualize what is actually happening to me during hypo episodes more specifically was misdiagnosed w depression at depression i feel is a little easier understood id like to be able to have them be aware of what an episode is like i cant exactly put it all into words when trying to explain it to them myself and i often feel like doing that ends up scaringworrying them more so im looking for a resource that can detail what hypomania is really like whether that be a daytoday kind of thing or just an extensive list of symptoms most recently i spent several days awake and have had obvious weight loss which led my dad to ask my older brother if he thought i had been getting into methcoke as my dad was previously addicted to meth and experienced similar symptoms thanks to all who took the time to read this,2
nobody outside of this type of relationship will ever understand when im stable i am the best husband our relationship is amazing model relationship then when im manic which for me usually swings between periods of high anxietyirritability or intense happiness we have a troubling relationship its so weird how one can snap back to the other i feel so bad for my wife who is a rock but everyday i strive to keep myself stable for her,2

i got diagnosed with bipolar three days ago and have already been diagnosed with anxiety and autism i dont know where to start i am relieved because my mother thought i was having hormonal changes or i was exaggerating but my father actually tried to help whenever i think of those moments being frustrated over my mother saying that i was using it as an excuse after i got diagnosed with anxiety it saddens me i feel better because now she is more careful what do i do know i have some coping methods like music physics math etc,2
ive been hurt so many times by people i decided to trust im just over people at this point because of my illness anyone can hurt me so much more than i could ever hurt them its too hard trying to manage my emotions even without factoring in the selfishness and unpredictability of people ampxb should i start trusting again its been months and now im just bored but i dont want to get hurt again im still reeling from the extreme pain of the last time i was hurt people have too much power over me last time i was hurt it induced a mixed episode which resulted in psychosis and suicide attempts people are inherently selfish im convinced of this fact but im getting bored and lonely,2
and i got diagnosed with bipolar when i was is any of you diagnosed with depression kinda stuff during childhood i feel i am the only one and this feels goddamn lonely,2
the most recent manic episode i had was after being depressed and diagnosed with major depressive disorder to be prescribed zoloft within weeks i was staying up for days and delusional i thought my partner was going to kill me so i called the police arrived and i was very agitated and explained my delusions and they took me to the nearest psych ward for an evaluation unfortunately that psych ward didnt keep me long enough despite my volunteering to stay longer they also gave me a medication i ended up allergic to which took treatment even longer this resulted in asking my inlaws who live in a different state miles away to help me care for my daughter until i found the right medication combination and was stable i knew it could take a few months and i had no one else available local to me the only way my inlaws would take my daughter is if i signed over guardianship i was under the impression it would only be for a year at the most but honestly i wasnt really in the right mind to consent to that paperwork i just knew i needed help and i did what i could to ensure my daughter had the best care possible while i got stable fast forward to now my partner and i petitioned the courts to end guardianship as i have been stable for years i have letters from my therapist and pdoc stating i am in treatment and stable and medication compliant well my inlaws are trying to prove i am unfit for things i did while i was manic so they can adopt my daughter without my consent or permission through the courts theyre also trying to prove that my partner their child is unfit i am less worried about that my therapist says theyre on a witch hunt and that theyre just trying to raddle me and no judge would grant them adoption i hope shes right i just wanted to share what i am going through because support would be nice and if anyone else is going through this you arent alone,2
tldr im bipolar type two with mixed features currently in a hypomanic mixed episode i experience some of these things clenched jaw minute panic attack that disappears in a few seconds leaving you confused but not feeling bad just very confused nightmares and night sweating completely forgetting to eat and losing the instinct of eating or liking food except shit like sweets cola coffee and chips with cigs ofc do you note im like sure im hypomanic right now and have been for almost a month but was in denial until a week ago seeing psychiatrist on friday to talk anyway im experiencing these things and was wondering if anyone else had this clenched jaw most of the time random minute panic attackdark dissociation few times a week had one where i couldnt contain a scream that was just so guttural like i was giving birth and then started hyperventilating so hard i almost fainted and had to sit down and hold onto something to not fall but then all of a sudden you have a posotive thought and it disappearears in a second making you wonder what even happened and laughing at how dramatic you are nightmares or night sweating completely forgetting to eat like losing the instinct to eat even when im hungry i dont think about food but i think of resolving the problem so i stuff myself with the easiest fastest food thats kinda nutritious and idc about the taste like plain slices of protein bread bananas i dont even like the texture or the taste of bananas but its the cleanest and most efficient for hunger vegan premade protein shakes in bottles over months ive consumed about of them i have one every morning and other shit meal mentioned above and sometimes have the patience to boil a pack of ravioli that takes minutes to cook and eat it just with olive oil and balsamic vinegar or airfry in minutes a pack of vegan nuggets or fish sticks and eat them plain yup no sauce and not evem fried such a treat less dishes btw im also diagnosed with mixed episodes and ive experienced them but usually they are way darker and cold with a bit of psychotic moments and i just feel superior to others like an evil god and im full of rage whereas here i feel quite at peace but a bit out of control but i know that im gonna take care of it soon going back tomorrow to my parents and overall i feel happy everyday and grateful and i feel like the world is so beautiful but i just have those breakdowns described above few times a week if not almost daily these days mmh yeah i talk a lot but thats a known hypimanic thing thank you for reading if you did and have a good insert what it is for you,2
i was diagnosed with bipolar last may after trying to kill myself and did seven nights in a pysc ward which did me so much good for awhile before my diagnosis i had talked to my doc about adhd cause i felt i fitted the symptoms of that so was in shock when i was eventually diagnosed with bipolar when on what i call highs i get extremely productive i get so much done and take up new hobbies that never last more than a couple of months my lows are never so bad im depressed but i have no energy mentally or physically and no interest in doing anything and i fall behind on everything the house gets messy and i struggle to achieve anything i have kids so my anxiety goes through the roof when things get messy im snappy to be around for my wife and my mother and i get into moods because everything in the house is messy again its like a vicious circle my lows causes me to let the place get untidy and the mess causes me to spiral into worse moods but sometimes when i read what other people go through and mine doesnt seem so bad in comparison i start to doubt i even have bipolar these thoughts sneak into my head i feel like an imposter and that im not really as bad as i think and im only lazy subconsciously tricking people and cheating by being on illness benefit are these thoughts normal i feel so guilty with myself then and it makes my anxiety even worse,2
ive been battling bipolar for about about years and just recently diagnosed and medicated in the past year and a half every episode i have results in my thyroid swelling up as a reaction to stress like so big the endocrinologist gasped when he saw it i have a whole bunch of nodules on my thyroid and now instead of the thyroid swelling up its the nodules that are filling with fluid and swelling uponly when im at the end of an episode so i know its due to stress and the endocrinologist agrees ive also experienced sibo and i still do if i dont follow a strict diet i became allergic to fragrance coconut on skin and aloe vera all out of nowhere and my hair was falling out this all happened when i was unmedicated undiagnosed and extremely stressed out and my anxiety was through the roof im just curious if anyone else has experienced extreme stress from these episodes thats resulted in other illnesses,2
im complimenting everyone and chatting with every stranger i meet i did a bunch of art projects this weekend and have been having super great ideas lately at least i think theyre great the hypomania is here that is all and im posting on reddit more,2
has anyone ever stumble or read about something that could happen in the future and you start feeling weird and anxious and scared that it will happen because you read it as if you could manifestwill the scenario into existence because you feel like you have abilities to predict it to happen and the thing would probably never happened if you didnt read it,2
people who consider their bipolar well managed are you ever symptomatic ive been stable and and symptom free for years but recently i have been struggling with some racing thoughts and i feel completely overwhelmed i am in a stressful situation that will be over in a weeks do you call your dr and change your meds or do you just ride it out,2
so im bipolar i ive had pretty severe psychotic episodes before after a really stressful day when i had to bring my dog to the vet er i think it triggered some hypomania i feel euphoric hitting the gym banging out a bunch of projects at work trying to buy a house all of a sudden even though my lease doesnt end til november having sex with my husband every day but in the back of my mind im constantly worried this could spiral into a full blown manic episode this is the first time since last summer ive actually felt good like im actually going out every day feeling happy and i cant even really enjoy it because im chronically anxious it will spiral out of control i hate that i cant just be happy,2
just a funny anecdote one of my telltale signs of being hypomanic is midnight bakingcooking batches of cookies muffins bread it may suck but damn is it delicious,2
ive noticed that i often feel like everyone is watching me and judging every single thing and i have to act accordingly to not come off as weird like for example when im at a crosswalk waiting to cross it feels like every single car is staring at me not even necessarily the people in the cars but the cars themselves are looking at me almost if that makes sense it usually feels invasive but if im being honest sometimes i weirdly enjoy it and i think its some weird part of my brain wanting attention to be pulled to me its confusing and im not really sure how to deal with it,2

im not experiencing psychosis or mania but sometimes i look in the mirror and i see something that isnt there this also happens with auditory hallucinations where i hear someone calling my name when theyre not there ive kind of accepted that im just gonna experience the world a little differently than everyone else at this point these hallucinations dont bother me at all and only last a few seconds definitely not something that warrants switching medication,2
they dont like me when im depressed they dont like me when im manic why does the way i act put everyone in a panic fuck this is the way that i am they just wanna medicate and slaughter the lamb im a pure soul my rhymes got that sick flow what you fronting for mood like a revolving door and i dont even care used to smoke blunts and blow it in the air but they dont like that either had to give up the weed and the ether so here i am numb just the way you like me wont scare anyone wont just do it like nike so ill go through the motions although they still have their notions thought i would ride til i die in my dreams i can still fly anything to feel alive but they took away my keys so i cant drive so i guess ill express myself as a poet im still the shit dont care if you know it just another face in the crowd hide me away in a shroud,2
i know mania can be triggered by stress but has anyones mania been triggered by self harm i know in the moment it doesnt feel traumatic but self harm is traumatic im struggling with thoughts of self harm i havent been aware of my bp for long and i dont know what triggers my episodes and i want to know if i were to self harm if i would trigger an episode,2
i have been taking saphris asenapine for over years and also use a cpap one weird thing i have noticed is if i take the saphris right before putting my cpap mask on the saphris doesnt seem to work as well i think its because the air from the machine dries out my throat and because the med is sublingual it does not dissolve correctly has anyone else noticed this,2
yesterday i went to the walk in clinic because i was sure i was having some sort of heart irregularity or attack the doctor told me she thinks it is because i havent been taking lamotragine i ran out and since i lost my health insurance havent been able to get regular care i have been on lamotragine since i am on my way to pick it up now surprisingly i can afford it through their discount programi am just so so scared that i actually need this medication i know that might not make much sense but it is just starting to feel so real that i might not be able to live without it i didnt know going without it would literally feel like i was having a heart attack i had been starting to think that maybe i had even been misdiagnosed back then but that seems common on this subidk i dont have my parents or friends or really any support network i also cant afford therapy so i just needed to vent about how scared i feel i was certain it was a heart attack,2

ive been dating this guy for the past nine months were mutually exclusive but not yet bfgf i have bipolar disorder and have been diagnosed on a few occasions i fear that if i tell him or he experiences me during an episode itll be too much so my question is when is the right time how do i have this conversation when did you tell your partner,2
hi im headed into work so going to just get this out fast in hopes someone can give me advice i have been at home for almost years with mostly depression some hypo mania and one scary manic episode brought on by an antidepressant i also have extreme anxiety and adhd i started lithium in august and was able to help my husband at work within a month i came out of my shell began to make eye contact conversation and was hired on as an administrative assistant my career was teaching but i know i can not be that person anymore i have struggled the whole time but was managing okay enough to continue i am not okay again work is stressful in an unreasonable way and i can feel myself crashing i am terrified of becoming the hermit i was for years i was hospitalized last march wanting to die from so much empty i need to keep a purpose anxiety is almost unbearable and the empty i cant do it anymore feeling is taking over music and tv feels fake and every task is a huge effort these are some of my signs i am back to needing ativan to function most days and adderal the others how can i prevent a full crash help current meds lithium mg at night ativan a couple times a week and increasing adderal when i am paralyzed several days a week i just added mg magnesium glycinate and vit d any words of wisdom are appreciated,2
im just so over everything honestly i use to love cleaning and self care and now it take all my energy to shower once a week ive been on all these different medications and the only one that worked my insurance randomly decided they didnt want to pay for it anymore my psychiatrist is frustrated with me because i havent started therapy but i genuinely cant afford it right now and i fully believe im in a place where therapy just isnt a good idea im on geodon right now and it just makes me feel nothing i miss who i was before this diagnosis its all so exhausting,2
im very recently diagnosed in conjunction w asd im just very scared of my head im scared of the way my brain makes me think and i am scared of how little control i have over it ive no idea what world ive entered into mostly because i dont understand much yet despite wanting to ive studied psychology at university before dropping out multiple times and its so easy to look at things on the outside and understand them but to look introspectively is so difficult its difficult to analyse the thoughts i should and shouldnt listen to its difficult to place or recognise moments of irritability excitement etc sometimes im panicking without even knowing im panicking or why im just very much in a state of barely knowing whats going on in my head until the aftermath unless its depressive thoughts those are pretty easy to figure out and by far the most common for me people near me just say i shouldnt think that way but its hard explaining why i feel i have no control over how i genuinely feel if that makes sense does it get better ive been prescribed mood stabilisers,2
for context i have type one and a history of hospitalisations in years ect worked amazingly but only for a while tried loads of medications and it seems like weve finally found a combo that works i havent had a serious episode for over two years now i have a two year old son and despite the manic episode i had after four days is labour when he was born hes the best thing that has ever happened to my mental health i love him to bits even though he was a surprise and i was totally sure i wasnt ready now my husband and i want a sibling for him we both never had siblings of our own so he has no cousins and we both wish we had siblings we want a baby sooner rather than later because the age gap keeps getting bigger years difference is ok but seems like much more to me i dont know ive started taking folic acid and we should be ready to start trying to conceive in may we also happen to be moving across the uk for my husbands work in july if all goes well i could be pregnant by then i told my psychiatrist this and he told me that my antidepressant clomipramine is dangerous to the baby in pregnancy and can cause serious heart defects he wants to switch me to an ssri citalopram which ive tried several of and they havent done much for me in the past clomipramine worked for me i think because its also effective in ocd and while i dont have ocd my depressive thoughts are definitely obsessive ive been taking clomipramine for since a mild depressive episode i had a year ago and since i havent had any depression at all and i havent gone manic either im just worried with the move even though im really looking forward to it and the pregnancy and the medication change might be too much as a mother i feel having a serious episode is not an option but then am i just putting more pressure on myself is this crazy should i try it or wait another year with the baby even just changing medication worries me but i cant consider pregnancy without doing that first i dont know exactly what im asking for here reassurance sanity check advice any and all of that is welcome,2
anybody else feel like their brain is bombarding them constantly its major things for me music in my head all the time nonstop sometimes its a real song sometimes its a song i made up in my head sometimes its a song i like sometimes its super annoying even my own songs intrusive thoughts could be anything from violent and disturbing images to something super benign i have a bag of mamma chia brand chia seeds every time i see i think mamma chia mamma chia figaro obsessive thinking ill become interested in a subject to the point where i cant stop thinking about it ill try to focus on something else but i creeps back in and i wind up reading the same wikipedia article times instead of doing what im supposed to be doing just wanted to see if anyone can relate to this,2
hey all i was recently diagnosed to sum up my dilemma my entire life anytime ive had a medical problem arise ive always been dismissed as it being anxiety i have a history of unexplained syncope episodes amp wacky blood test results but no doctor has ever taken me seriously perks of being a year old female ive been told to take antidepressants for viral illnesses amp the like so ive grown costumed to having a distrust towards doctors or i feel like they just use me for money amp dont listen to me ya know anyway thats not why im here i hit rock bottom a few months ago amp have been seeing a wonderful therapist who truly advocates for me amp gives me a voice he referred me to a psychologist amp we did the whole genesight thing she wants me to start taking latuda i did the whole googling the medicine thing amp asked some friends about it amp i have yet to see a good review i also dont want to be even more tired than i am now as im exhausted as is amp im scared meds could impact work or school i guess im just here asking for validation to ease my anxiety will meds actually help me or will i feel miserable im really scared im so hyper aware of my body amp i freak out about any minor change even headaches but also as the months go on the more i feel wildly reckless amp isolated if i start taking them amp want to get off them will they forever change me like antidepressants can id rather enjoy my few months of mania no matter how wild it can be vs forever be different i dont mean for any of this to seem invalidating or disrespectful by the way its just my experiencesparanoia,2
this film really triggered my anxiety in the theater because of its accurate representation of a panic attack but the real kicker for me is how puss looks at himself in his previous lives compared to his th one i feel like that is a perfect representation of my mania to now my first real depressive episode i have had i also just received my diagnosis and its hits me so hard because its like i dont even recognize myself anymore i feel just like puss anyone else feel this way about this movie,2
hey everyone thanks for taking time to read this ive question to everyone here who is stable for more than years what are the things that helped you for being stable,2
ive heard so many people on this sub complain when a non neurodivergent tells them they should start todo lists or journal or exercising these are all great coping mechanisms i understand the loneliness of being neurodivergent but shitting on routines and healthy habits isnt going to help anyone i have to take medication and journal and do lists and therapy and medication and take walks in nature and a bunch of other stuff are yall not doing that cause it damn sure helps,2
so im currently in a manic episode i think its hypomanic but my psychiatrist calls me manic anyway usually i enjoy watching movies or reading books and exercise but i now ive found that i dont have any concentration to do anything except writing my friends letters through mail i get to ramble on and on and on about anything that pops into my mind and the beauty of it all is i can edit it all out the way i like it so all the rapid thoughts that are racing through my mind seem to come out of my coherently i dont know what you guys can do with this information but i just want to share it with you life can be really beautiful if things are going well,2
i just want to take a minute and say how much i appreciate each and every one of you i am an icu nurse with a recent bipolar diagnosis and i get on here everyday because it just gives me a sense of comfort and relief knowing im not going through this alone so thank you everyone for sharingcommenting it really does help me get through my day love you all,2
hi i am curious if any of you have techniques on how to stop a hypomanic episode that doesnt include popping an ap pill for me i find that doing a lot of cardio or eating a highcarb meal a bowl of pasta slows my brain down,2
i just got done with an appointment with her and when i tried to bring up some of my concerns about things she basically said youre just unstable and increased my lithium dosage i spent so long organizing all my thoughts and all the things i wanted to say to her and she ended our session after not even minutes oh my god i cant stand her,2
background information i was diagnosed with bipolar type ii back in september and i work as a teacher recently i experienced the worst depressive episode of my life which forced me to apply for medical leave today my leave was accepted but only from march th earlier this month to april th my doctor and i agreed that taking the remainder of the school year off was in my best interest and the paperwork my doctor submitted reflected that is it normal for only a fraction of the specified leave time to be approved i was told i can apply for an extension but its just filling out the same exact form with the same exact information im terrified that my leave wont be extended and ill either have to quit my job or force myself to go back much earlier than anticipated any insight would be greatly appreciated thank you,2
ive started occasionally hallucinating shadow people in my peripheral vision when it happens i get the feeling they want to hurt me or might be hunting me at one point i felt like they might be waiting by my apartment to idk get me i consciously know they arent real but im still scared of them is that normal is that standard for just hallucinating or is that also something like paranoia edit i dont mean like being afraid because its happening i think if it were voices id be fine its more like i somehow know that shadow wants to kill me,2
had major hypomanicmanic episode julydecember last year i know what my realities are i really do however its like the obsessions creep back in and my brain wont stop cycling over a person that i know isnt healthy and a pos i know theyre intrusive thoughts i know what i need to do to combat them but damn its a fight every day i dont remember having this fight years ago that being said we are fighters we can do this im surrounding myself with people who know me and love me anyone else in the same boat,2
my ex who was the best sex ive ever had and ive had a lot of sex dumped my stuff in my living room on sunday and politely told me he never wanted to speak to me again well maybe someday which means never to try to cope i posted for hookups on reddit but every guy i sent my photo to rejected me this was never an issue before but i guess now that im im ugly im not fat i think i have a good body must be face issues i look really tired in all my photos so life sucks ive stopped taking my meds properly because i hate them ive stopped eating meals because i dont want to go back to being bulimic i blocked all my friends and family because they told me to talk to a professional about wanting to start drinking again im sober and since theres no professionals to talk to i guess im shit out of luck and better off not bothering them my mom did a wellness check on me when i told her id blocked her which i said she could do but lol i bought my first vape yesterday because i dont want to break my sobriety and i do not care if i start hearing voices and i tried to go to aa last night only to listen to a bunch of people whine about how hard step is while im literally writing it in my head just trying to find a sponsor to do it with now today my psych doctor has ghosted me the professional im supposed to talk to about drinking cant decide if shes doing a form or something came up cherry on top of this week lol,2
is this possible before my diagnosis i was given paxil and felt the most depressed i had ever been from what i remember its been almost years it felt like my head was very empty and dark my girlfriend said recently she was walking on eggshells around me back then and felt like i was going to lose it at any second i even want to say i remember having these two internal dialogues conflicting each other all the time i was really unhappy and felt suicidal continuously as well after giving the med weeks to work i got switched to effexor i did a little better with this one but still felt suicidal and empty fast forward years and now im diagnosed with bipolar disorder i have been given a mood stabilizer that has done really well for me the reason why i ask this is because i have this constant worry that im misdiagnosed for some reason i believe im suffering from imposter syndrome my psychiatrist seems very confident with his diagnosis i also believe this post could help others who are suffering from anxiety like i was to find out it could be actually bipolar disorder so can an ssri make someone with bp depressed instead of manic,2
ive been on a roller coaster the last months with medication i had started to think i had been misdiagnosed based on how terrible i have felt despite lithium and an ssri plus seroquel at bed i even scheduled a new psych for a second opinion in april then through some bad juggling and admin by my gp my citalopram prescription was cancelled instead of renewed the pharmacist gave me a loner box of meds but it was a lower dose fast forward a month later and im still on the lower dose low and behold hallelujah i feel fantastically average this aint no hypo and im definitely not depressed wow im considering going to an even lower dose but my intake appointment is so close i feel like i should probably leave it for now woo,2
ive really loved being part of this subreddit and having a place for support and understanding its not toxic here and thats so hard to find if you have any suggestions for other places online like here i would love a link or info if needed for reference i have bipolar cptsd and dependent personality disorder,2
id like to preface first by saying that im not american ive been diagnosed bipolar ii a few year ago during while in a psych ward during all the years ive been seeing psychiatrists it was brought up only once by a psychiatrist ive seen for less than a month ive been somewhat successfully treated with seroquel while i thought i had bp before my diagnosis this diagnosis as almost always made very little sense to me i do have some pretty extreme mood swings but far more than a year and they sometimes last only hours the psychiatrist who followed me years never brought it up he didnt change my meds didnt really take any interest in my symptoms he was pretty much happy just continuing the traitement that was prescribed to me during my trip to the psych ward last therapist didnt seem to believe i had any illness im seeing any therapists or psychiatrists anymore and i have stopped my meds so far im doing alright i would like to know if any of you have experienced very frequent mood swings say in the range of a year and very short episode because i find really hard to relate to other people with bipolar disorder,2
im type ii and am in the middle of a mixed episode except the hypomania isnt the happy energetic kind its the irritated at all times and so angry at life that im resisting the urge to throw things against a wall as hard as i can kind so yeah im down im fatigued and im about as pissed off as i could be for absolutely no reason i dont need any advice as ive been here many times before although advice is fine just venting to a group that understands what its like since nobody in my life really gets it thanks for reading,2
i was manic a while ago and i finally checked my email i applied for colleges when i was manic and i lied on the forms and i signed things that said i would get fined for lying i also hired an attorney to sue ppl but it gets worse its my friends dad i guess this is just a good rule check your emails after a manic episode,2
i went to a new psychiatrist who recommended paroxetine and alprazolam but what is everyones experience on this combo im still in the introductory stage with my new doctor so shes still reassessing me again but i did provide her my previous doctors certification of my bd diagnosis and prescription history so i guess im just looking for reassurance about this new regimen for bd please note that i communicate with my doctor ie i ask her what to lookout for when taking this medicine and i also read material about this but its always good to hear from other people,2
im currently in the middle of diagnosis for bipolar i got already medication lamictal even though i didnt yet get a official diagnosis since at psychiatrist appointment we didnt have enough time to go through all the diagnosis criteria and if my sympotoms fit in to those with psychiatrist weve been going through my possible hypomanias but specially been focused on one which was the most severe one during this period i broke up with my boyfriend do not regret it had a huge crush before breakup slept with the person i had a crush few days after breaking up felt really happy and energetic got involved in politics slept h a night usually h got in an out of situationships went to parties told everybody how beautiful i am usually im not happy with my body my psychiatrist didnt ask on my drug use but ive realized that before this episode or in the beginning of this episode i took some psychedelics i really dont want drug use on my medical records since ive been sober for a year now does anybody else have any feelings on drug use on their medical records if i tell my psychiatrist i have taken illegal drugs before the episode i might not get the diagnosis but then again i suffer from mood swings and cyclic severe depressions i dont know anymore what is my normal state and if i exaggerate my possibly hypomanic symptoms ive had other hypomanic episodes as well in one i had for few weeks i moved in with a guy for a month who id known for two days didnt fly back to home even though covid restrictions were starting posted dancing videos on instagram said i love you to the person i was living with had unprotected sex but again this person was very manipulative and was gaslighting me love bombing and getting mad for me moving out i feel like my psychiatrist could very easily misdiagnose me since my hypomanias might be caused some other things such as drugs or manipulation how do you feel is hypomania something that cant be caused by other factors in your life whole my life i have been doing impulsive decisions like gotten three tattoos at once my first ones brought flight tickets for next day traveled by myself applied to new schools cheated went to strip club not normal to me had hookups on all of these ive had regrets as well i dont know what is my personality and what not if i tell my psychiatrist that these actions were not normal to me then i probably get the diagnosis but also i do these things so regularly that maybe those are charasterictic to me,2
i see so many successful people with this disorder in fact almost everyone ive ever known with bp eventually treats it and thats good but for me no medication seems to work without dangerous side effects i also have psychotic episodes i cant work or go to school and skip most days because i am catatonically depressed i know my bp isnt the worst there is but i see so many people with bipolar who are successful and i guess i want to hear about the worst case scenario so i dont feel like i myself am the worst case because i feel like absolute shit all the time due to my lack of success in any area of life im pretty much the very bottom of society and it sucks im gonna stop my post here though cause the depression is creeping in now im not asking about anyone specific just an example or something or if its even possible for bp to be untreatable,2
light me up do it like when i bled say i love you then suffocate my voice mark my flesh make me your possession with your eyes gone red belittle every ounce of me all squeezed with no pulp left feel anemic confidence has shipped numbed to the rattling as apathy becomes my only friend,2
i had so many doctors think so many things were wrong with me over the years im curious to know how your experiences were in order i was diagnosed with borderline pd bulimia nervosa major depressive disorder general anxiety disorder dyslexia and finally bipolar type things they were unfortunately mostly right about,2
my husband got overwhelmed and left a week ago after i got diagnosed in january everything i have ever felt and done exploded to the point where i almost lost my job and my husband left but after thinking reading and talking with friends he realized something was of he came back and we talked for days then he booked an appointment with my psychiatrist and went there with me turns out im not type im very much type now i am starting new meds i understand much more about myself and i am finally hopeful for my future but most importantly my husband loves me and he is willing to stand by me,2
has anyone read feeling good and did it help at all my mom gifted it to me when ive started my medications and ive been really skeptical about the book i want to know how others experiences have been like with the book how has the book helped you the book was published years ago is it uptodate,2
i started reagila a month ago and i cant get rid of the restlessness the first two weeks were horror with side effects thank god the shaking stopped but this restlessness is driving me crazy literally lack of sleep is usually the best way for me to get hypomanic i have a desk job i cant sit still i cant even stand still i am currently walking k steps a day just to be able to sleep at night not including the bouncing around while working standing desk best purchase in years my doctor said it might be because my other meds arent playing well together i am slowly reducing them lamotrigine and fluoxetine and it should get better soontm but what is soon any tips i have a few days off right now and just cant enjoy them i dropped coffee which seems to have helped a little bit at least i am losing weight on it but might be because i was too nauseated to eat properly for weeks and i am constantly moving,2
hi yall i cannot use the tw flair i dunno why i am overall stable but something happened today and i feel manic grandiose thoughts hyper active brain usually my brain is quiet and organised now it works so much i have a headache lol etc you name it dreams of doing this and that eh and i couldnt even take a nap all because i wrote to my aunt i was never close with yes you read it right you might ask yourself ee what i hasten to explain so there was the year i went fullblown manic it was really intense my closest family was away but they knew something was up because of the things i had been telling them my online activity and overall behaviour reported by more distant family that lives nearby i visited them xx times per day so one time i really was scared i will die or something i opened the door to run to the family nearby and when i opened the door there was this aunt she is not the one i visited she lives also nearby but more far away then the other family members i was afraid to sleep i didnt sleep properly in this time period only kind of blacked out she tuckled me to sleep and i had some rest when my closest family came back clearly distressed the way the house looked many other things they called the ambulance and there i was in the mental hospital lol this aunt was helping my mother to deal with me ok now back to these times this aunt is a kind of person that forwards these pictures with written things on them to everybody as i dont own the whatsapp app i wasnt reading them i only installed it sometimes and i wrote like a flower to her as a response or wishing also everything well as a response to these pictures today i opened whatsapp and the last pictures from her were at the beginning of march it was unusal because she used to send them a lot i kind of regretted not replying more to her even with a flower emoji and i randomly send her happy second day of spring and like that it kind of switched something in my brain lol i want to mention that my mania was always occuring in springsummer time it is a little bit chaotic but english isnt my first language i wish i didnt send this message there is also a possibility that i somehow didnt get these pictures and she was still sending them it makes me think if i couldnt control this impulse to send a message maybe there will be other things i will not be able to control,2
so what do you guys do when youre wired in the middle of the night i might go to the gym again tbh it was fun today i should rest tho before i hurt myself what kind of drinks help you guys sleep or calm down,2
i got these a while back the semicolon healed poorly and i had to go back for a touch up the other one also needed some minor adjustments but now at least they dont look gross very happy with them and they are my first tattoos,2
anyone have a similar experience when i became completely manic it felt like i had to use different persona for a different group of people and also had this idea that my exes and toxic people were stalking me so i had over ig accounts at least there might be more because i also had three phones back then i just charged one of the phones i frequently used during the last manic episode and found out it has been public for over a year when i thought all my accounts were private i am so embarrassed because i dont know whos seen it probably a lot of my old coworkers because i might have asked one of them who was my best friend to tag me on his account maybe my friends who left me during an earlier manic episode saw the account i dont know i cannot believe i left it to be seen by the whole world i wonder that is why my ex cut me off entirely when we used to be friends even after we broke up i wonder thats why some people randomly said earlier this year they thought i was taken to a hospital anyway i dont know if i will be able to sleep tonight now i am actually laughing out loud because this is just unbelievable this almost feels like im in a movie where the protagonist is stuck in this limbo of facing all the crazy manic shit from the past everyday sometimes i try to be grateful for the things i still have sometimes im glad i finally accepted that i have this mental illness but today this shook me to the core and i guess i do still care a lot about things i swore i could not care about any more it feels like everything was part of this weird movie that was filmed and it had no script was directed by a nasty unprepared directionless amateur director who wanted to see what kind of extreme things i could do or say that would not make sense to the old me this is just like a cherry on top of my bipolar cake wow what a day,2
i just need support my mom passed away tragically in an accident last week ive been a wreck i go from agony to numbness ive never lost anyone close to me so this is my first true heart break and i honestly think ill never heal it i just have to find better coping mechanism i love my mom so fucking much we were close and we bonded through having bipolar disorder she understood me without trying she was the only other person i know who goes to treatment for bipolar i wanted her to show me i can survive this so from the bottom of my broken heart i would love some support coping mechanism or just stories that will give me hope,2
hi all cannot classify this post as seeking advice or rant or complain or anything just felt like sharing it i dont know what it is but i am terribly addicted to cigarettes no amount of nothing or no degree of any consequence is helping me to quit it feels like kinda intuition that i will die smoking i know i have an addictive personality but then even with all the self awareness amp heightened conscious the cognitive dissonance of smoking isnt leaving me they say if you play with bullets you die with one i guess my bullet is cigarette not even sure if its got anything to do with being bipolar maybe this sub isnt even right place to type this i just felt like typing amp sharing maybe over sharing just lost god knows thanks for reading till the end if anyone actually came this far i am grateful amp god bless us all,2
got referred to a psychiatrist from my pcp behavioral center booked my appointment with a therapist got diagnosed with bipolar a few weeks ago my pcp said he didnt have the resources to properly treat so he referred me to a behavioral health center so ive waited weeks for this appointment i was very clear while scheduling that this appointment was for seeking medication this is the earliest appointment they could get me and its only because they had a cancellation got sent the info finally today for my appointment on friday looked at it real quick on the portal and theyve scheduled me for a telehealth session with an lpcc i just looked it up and they cant prescribe medications the entire fucking reason i made the appointment im absolutely gutted the amount of effort and energy it took me just to schedule the appointment with my pcp to get a referral because everyone i called said i needed that was astounding i finally got the gumption to take hold of this shit and try to get better and this is what i get i literally feel so defeated and like theres absolutely no point at all i just came down from a hypo week and the depression is hitting hard and then i find this out the rage and sadness i feel is literally making me physically ill and i feel like i could break all of my fucking fingers im sure someone is going to comment and tell me to check myself into a facility for inpatient care i cant fucking afford to i have in my bank account and payday isnt for another week i cant take any time off work because i will literally not make my mortgage payment im sure some people really benefit from therapy and maybe at a later point in my recovery from this shit ill be more open to it but right now all i can think is how the fuck is talking to some stranger on the phone about my problems and them saying some stupid shit like oh i can hear how difficult this is for you try these excersizes the next time you feel like youre getting unmanageable going to fix anything i want to be fucking medicated i want to get to the point where i can act or feel like halfway of a part of a normal fucking human being and maybe then i can focus on miss lindas breathing therapy i have been looking so forward to this appointment and ive been so proud of myself for even making it i felt like i could get through the swings these past few weeks because i had this to look forward to and maybe just fucking maybe id get even an ounce of relief from this shit or be on the road to an ounce of relief a means to an end i felt like i was moving on from square one and on my way to progress and now i feel like ive fallen so much farther behind it im going to have to find a different provider and wait another fucking six weeks through this shit i cannot do this,2
one of my worst experiences with psychosis was when i woke up in a cold sweat convinced i had killed my parents in their sleep i was terrified that i stabbed them to death i kept getting up and opening their door to make sure they were still alive and breathing while they slept but i couldnt shake the feeling it lasted until my dad woke up for work hours later has anyone experienced something like this,2

after six months of struggling i finally felt like i got my depression under control however lately my mood has been faltering due to how lonely i am its a type of loneliness ive never felt before its so bad it physically hurts i cant find the words to explain the intensity of it it hurts so bad i can genuinely say i have only one friend and she lives halfway across the world i live with my parents while i attend college i have to take online classes so the only time i really leave my house is to go to a coffeeshop a couple days a week i dont have a drivers license due to crippling anxiety im working on getting it so even if i did have friends i wouldnt be able to see them often so i have no one no one to talk to besides my parents and thats just mostly superficial stuff im sorry if this is all over the place i was just wondering if anyone had any advice on what i could do to stop myself from slipping into full depression,2
okay so around this time last year i went on seroquel ir due to unable to sleep and depressive symptoms that shit rocked me and i couldnt handle being a zombie hours a day so i switched to xr a couple months later well jump to now i want to come off it one i think the depressive symptoms are mainly gone i just cant handle the side effects any more the constant hunger that cant be ignored so hard to wake up at in the am ect i know this is bad but i stopped taking it for a few days because of hypomanic episode and it wasnt the episode but not being on it that made me feel so much fucking better like i could breathe im still on lamotrigine and want to go up more since my mood has been a little whacky so im obviously not on nothing but have people gone off seroquel after a bad depressive episode and was your psych on board or did they make you switch meds did you just fall back into a depression please just let me know any of your stories thanks all,2

i have had diagnosed bipolar for a few years now been on multiple medications and recently i feel like im just passed the point of being treated ive had some really destructive manic episodes and it has included a lot of drug use my finances are out of control and now i just feel like i have no motivation to do anything with my life i hate this i want to live a normal life but i just dont think its ever happening,2
i have been with my partner for a little over years now we have had our ups and downs ive done things in the relationship during manic episodes that i am not proud of ive sought sexual relationships mainly sexting with others been emotionally abusive and quite manipulative this was primarily during times before i was diagnosed with bipolar and on a solid medicationtherapy regiment now i feel like i am the partner they need howerve and heres the rub i have a sinking suspicion she is not the partner i need she isnt supportive anymore and is somewhat condescending she is constantly reminding me of all the past pain i have caused and when i bring up that it was in the past she just says that i am not taking responsibility for that pain recently she has gone so far as to comment on my appearance calling my beard pubes and asking me to shave so she can find me attractive again she brags to others that she got me to shave and belittles me in front of friends she fights with me anytime i bring up a change that i wish to see in the relationship she has commented on my weight she has commented on my ability to be a father she has accused me of having inappropriate emotional relationships with friends i am honestly not sure if deserve this i did emotionally cheat on her i have verbally accosted her i have been mean aggressive and manipulative in my own these actions are mainly when i am manic and being confronted i become incredibly defensive to the point that i will be this way i know the relationship sick and that we need to speak with a couples counselor but i am afraid that my partner will just listen and not change now she used to be quite supportive she took me in when i had no place to go after coming back from afghanistan she dealt with my ptsd she has loved me through so much i just am hurt by the way she is currently treating me,2
so i just recently had a new evaluation and the proctor is convinced that ive been misdiagnosed which is extremely common with bpd and bipolar but now im struggling i feel relieved but horrified not to say that bipolar is better than bpd or less bad but its just distressing to have a label stripped and replaced with another if im being honest ive doubted my bipolar diagnosis for a long time now but somehow i feel like im betraying my sense of community and self by feeling hopeful its like idk i guess it was easier to say its just bipolar because it became a cop outit was easier to dismiss my explosive emotions and constant mood swings as just being bipolar symptoms because it meant that i could treat it with meds and i tried so hard to act like the mood stabilizers help but they dont i cycle through so many extremes on a daily basis at my old psych all of this was dismissed and treated with anti psychotics that just make me feel sluggish and disinterested it feels liberating to be listened to for once but i feel so lost like ive just been stripped of the identity ive been cultivating for years its weird it feels like i owe everyone an update like ive got to go on an ive got bpd tour so that no one hates me or accuses me of faking a disorder ugh idk man feeling liberated but also scared can i stay in this sub lmao im so comfy here,2
uhhh so my self esteem has been so incredibly low that now when i look in the mirror i dont recognize my face i feel like a stranger its scary and weird to look directly into my eyes in the mirror because i just feel like its not me in the reflection i avoid pictures and mirrors all the time and now i dont know how to get back to feeling at least a bit comfortable with ny face please help,2

this is all very hypothetical for myself but im hoping others reading have insight i am in the us im in a job that often triggers me for various reasons ive been in a almost constant depressive episode for the past almost two months the exception is some hours of natural easehappiness from spending time with a few nonjudgmental friends throughout that time my work performance has tanked and its becoming an issue i have coworkers talking to my boss about it and i dont blame them but my boss is trying to be nice about it to a degree that makes me worry that im taking his reputation i will be doing an outpatient treatment program in the next few weeks i am already on intermittent fmla but the current plan which i do not like much is to do parttime work in the afternoons at my current job while i do the program in the mornings i just had an anxiety attack after getting a phonecall from my boss to talk about it i feel like the end is near but my boss and a few coworkers are still trying to be on my side and i see that however i need to leave sooner or later i used references to get this job ive been in it for just under a year that were absolutely glowing from people i respect quitting is embarrassing for me and i wonder how much it will reflect on them i dont feel comfortable using them as references any more i have a long job history on my resume with a new job about every three years but i think it will look weird if i dont use anyone from those jobs as references my main question is assuming i dont have references how do i find a job im i live alone because i have a hard time with roommates i know i can be the problem but i always try to resolve any conflict and the older ive gotten the better ive gotten but i also am in a difficult place emotionally and am having a hard time focusing and functioning i feel like im at the edge and yet theres a light at the end of the tunnel of treatment if i can just figure out how to do this job a little bit longer and find something else that can help me keep my home and continue my medications and therapy feels like a tall order tldr assuming i dont have references how do i find a job as someone in their s,2
ive been pondering the question of whats next for almost years now and i cant make the decision the country where i now live was always a temporary destination but due to covid i was forced to stay longer than expected now i feel like im stuck here its been years here years longer than anticipated and i dont know what to do whatever choice i make its a big life choice that due to my financial situation locks me in to that choice for a few years simply said i dont trust my decisions when i finally pin something down i ask myself is this decision made by a sane mind or am i in some state of either mania or depression but because its so difficult to figure out i end up doing nothing this has been going on for years now and im not sure what to do do you have any experience with this and how do you make big decisions is there a way to minimise the risks of a bad decision because of the disease,2

ive been struggling a bit recently f diagnosed bipolar type unspecified years ago i have a clear history of depression going back to high school that i dont dispute i was diagnosed adhd as an elementary schooler and again in high school good student but disruptive in class incessant talker impulse control issues highly unmotivated unless im interested in the subject object permanence issues that persist today medicated for it on and off was prescribed a variety of medications and responded best to adderall but i also have a touch of anxiety so dosing was finicky treating the adhd diagnosis yielded some progress but never addressed all of my issues i was medicated for depression at various times with similar results but notably was never treated for both diagnoses at the same time edited a typo four years ago i was unmedicated and my depression was the worst it had ever been i started seeing a new psychiatrist pried a bit into my family medical history both adhd and bipolar appear and got a bipolar diagnosis ive been on trileptal and wellbutrin since then and like before i feel a little better than i did before the meds but the issues arent addressed my symptoms are mixed and i feel some degree of symptomatic obviously good days and bad ones every single day my manic symptoms consistently spike in conjunction with anxiety flare ups which are always traceable to a trigger my sister f is diagnosed with depression and adhd and when she describes how the combination affects her it matches up to my constant mixed symptoms to a t ive started to wonder if i havent been going at my mental health the wrong way and im extremely anxious about bringing it up to my doctor for fear of sounding manic i dont think that im healed or no longer in need of meds and i dont plan on taking myself off of them i also dont plan on asking for stimulants im open to any treatment plan deemed a fit but i have a lot of concern that i wont be taken seriously has anyone been through anything like this to be clear im not asking for commentary on a diagnosis just seeking advice for broaching this subject with my doctor part of me wonders if i might be best off trying to connect with a new one ive raised concerns about my meds not being effective numerous times in the past and havent really felt heard but then i worry about the appearance of doctor shopping and again im not actively seeking stimulants anyway any wisdom would be appreciated,2

hi all in gym class today i was playing dodgeball and the girl that i dont like for many reasons was in the corner not really doing anything and i screamed at her completely unprovoked usually im a super chill person and avoid confrontation at all costs but i was literally in like a dreamlike state where i thought i was having a dream and that i could do anything i wanted without any repercussions this has happened before when i thought i was asleep and i could do anything i wanted and i am also diagnosed with bipolar i looking back i do regret it because this is going to be a fucking headache for me and im so scared that im gonna do something that then gets put on my record because that would make it harder for colleges and also because i am being scouted to go to schools for my sport so can anyone tell me if colleges specifically recruitment scouts care about records and mental illnesses that are so active as bipolar i,2
i recently went through a very distressing breakup where he cut me out of his life completely i dont have any family or friends to call they all tell me to talk to a professional so i blocked them no sense causing strife my psych doctor doesnt answer emails my family doctor doesnt have an email or phone number my therapist doesnt give out her number or respond to emails i dont know where to turn in crisis the wait at my er is hours or more i dont have a sponsor yet or anyone from aa to call meetings make me sad because i am not ruining my life with alcohol i have nothing to ruin even if i tried bipolar takes those things away from you i really want to go buy it everyone tells me not to drink but doesnt want to support me when times get hard i understand they have their own problems and its not personal but i need help i only fucking stopped drinking beduse a psych doctor said it would help my moods and how my drugs process through my body but ive never felt worse its been days and no end in sight for the pain i am no longer taking my meds right and going to buy weed i am done i will take the psychosis risk ill take maniam where do i go is there a helpline i can call when i need immediate support to not buy alcohol i dont feel suicidal so im not sure if that is acceptable let me repeat in caps i do not feel suicidal i am in pain and self destructive there is a difference,2

all my life ive had anxiety amp adhd i had parents who said rub some dirt in it to everything so i wasnt diagnosed until college started taking adhd meds i was in therapy for a while feeling good but after a few years couldnt afford it anymore months ago i was put on setraline by my pcp and started therapy with betterhelp that therapy app a month ago my therapist says she thinks i have bpd or bipolar depression or ptsd maybe more than one and i stop taking the setraline two weeks ago my therapist said she believes i have bipolar depression and need to seek additional support anybody have any advice on any of it like where the heck do i start yes i know this is social media and im not going to take any one persons experience or advice and run with it but i get overwhelmed with medical jargon and id love to get an idea of what i may be up against amp what i may want to be cautious of,2
okay so years ago i was diagnosed with bipolar and at the time i was like this doesnt sound right but i guess ill go with it i was put on lamotrigene after a minute appointment with my psychiatrist where with some vague descriptions of what my highs and lows were he decided it was a solid diagnosis but the thing is he never asked for specifics about what they were like just generally if i experienced them the highs of my mania would last about months at a time and usually consisted of me being very active and upbeat but i never exactly had any risky behaviors associated with it ive never had periods of hypersexuality or completely upended my life on a whim or anything extreme like that i can get irritable and my impulse control has never been great but ive never felt like my thoughts were racing or anything like that probably the most extreme thing ive ever done was to move to a different state after a year relationship that i felt trapped in ended i just needed a fresh start from it and i got that before moving back home with a better perspective albeit in the middle of a depressive episode in fact the only really concerning thing i ever had going on were intense periods of depression also lasting between and months at a time i would have a hard time getting myself motivated to do basic tasks and my interest in things i enjoyed waned during those times to pretty much nothing being put on meds i was just coming out of a long funk and after starting lamotrigene it never really felt like that funk ended i still have problems motivating myself to do basic things even years in and i constantly feel like im lagging and forcing myself to do everything and i hate it during my up periods i used to actually workout and be active and would write and take my son to the park and be an active and eager participant in family activities but since being medicated i dont have any of that im gaining weight and have zero motivation to do anything about it despite being miserable because of it being an active parent feels like a chore and i cant write to save my life i feel like im a totally different person and i dont want to be this way anymore i think i might have been misdiagnosed but idk how to broach this with my psychiatrist i feel like he barely listens to me if anything my symptoms are much closer to that of adhd or mdd just applying my lived experiences to them but when i tried to bring up adhd he kind of handwaved it away saying that adult adhd was difficult to diagnose and left it there im not sure how to bring this up with him and was hoping some people here might be able to give me some tips on how to do that should i get a nd opinion from another psychiatrist i just want to stop feeling this way,2
soon after discovering im bipolar i realized that it clearly affects the way i grieve throughout the year i was i lost people i was close to in a wide variety of ways it was too much for my brain so i just didnt process it i didnt feel like i had the time at i lost a cousin who i had greatly looked up to and i still wasnt processing so i started therapy which helped me move on from the then deaths this was also prior to medication at this time i am now medicated and im grieving a brother a grandmother and an aunt who all died of separate causes though two died on the same night all in the span of february its again too much for my brain way too much like in the universe of shitty fuckery i have dealt with which is a lot this really takes the cake my brain is bouncing all over from sobbing with utter despair and literally being unable to pick myself up off the floor to being so manic that i want to tear my hair out and break everything around me so instead i manic clean to just existing i havent even been able to return to work and its almost april i raised my brother and i feel like i didnt just lose a brother i lost a son and a friend every stage of grieving just feels pointless its too much i dont know what to do,2
im in the middle of changing my meds once again and my anger keeps getting the best of me i feel like i dont have any control over my behavior abilify was working but i switch to another med because i was gaining weight and my dad kept calling me fat m btw so i switched to oxcarbazepine that didnt work at all so now im back on abilify i feel like i just cant win i have a fairly privileged life so complaining just feels wrong but i really need to vent i just hate myself for hating myself if that makes any sense i feel like im treating the people around me like shit witch makes me feel worse i dont mean to my terrible thoughts just slip out every thing just kind of hurts im tired,2
f ive already dropped out of uni once before because it makes my episodes so much worse ig first time i dropped out it was because of a depressive episode in which i severely self harmed and almost had another suicide attempt and was hospitalised again now ive been trying really hard w new meds and everything to be at least somewhat consistent w uni work and yet i had another self harm relapse and i had a hypomanic episode in which i did everything but uni work and now exams have come up again and im just going to fail them the guilt of all of my uni work going to shit bc of this really makes me want to just end myself because it just makes me feel like such a failure and weakling for giving in to the disorder or whatever i just feel like im wasting everyones time with deluding myself that i can finish uni like this i dont really know what to do with myself anymore also uni in my country doesnt have any kind of proper health leave or break system or a school therapist,2
i got diagnosed as bipolar and its been really difficult seeing other people online who have had different experiences than me with it it kind of makes me feel like mine isnt real or that im making it up somehow its hard to see the person i am when im manic as me this all makes sticking to meds a challenge i know ill just end up talking to a wall by myself in a psych ward without them but all of this makes it really hard to follow through has anyone else felt this way,2
being in a low is getting pretty tiresome especially with pmdd on top of it all im pretty self aware and tell my partner to hide dangerous things in the house when im heading into the low when im in it i just cant believe any of my beliefs ie everything happens for a reason lol i used to think i had a lesson to learn im on earth for a reason why would i be given a lesson thats so hard does anyone else feel this way or does anyone have something extremely enlightening to add thank you friends x,2

i have adhd and my psychiatrist suspects i have cooccurring bipolar ll i dont know how i feel about that cuz it seems like theres a fair bit of overlap between adhd and bipolar symptoms even though theyre completely different conditions here are some questions i have how does cooccurring adhd affect bipolar symptoms how does hypomaniamania look different than a mood shift related to adhd if youve ever just been on stimulant medication what was your experience,2
i was diagnosed as bipolar but honestly i dont know if i am the signs i have seem to be more adhd than bipolar including rejection dysphoria trouble concentrating procrastination etc what i have that maybe are bipolar characteristics are sometimes i get irritated easily attachment issues maladptive daydreaming gad and depression but other than that i dont know if im bipolar i am for now taking mg of lithium for days in days i will increase to mg im scared because i dont know if this is really my disorder what happens to people who arent bipolar but take lithium im not feeling any positive differences its just making me feel bad physically for now,2

disclaimer not asking if im manic ik im manic i just am curious on if what i think caused it is even possible well its official my guess was correct i know this because ive been crying for no reason and i was like oh im just dramatic then i started getting very irritable then paranoid and now i feel coked up i hate it here idk what triggered it is it possible that realllly good news could have triggered it cause over springbreak i got the best news that the person who sexually assaulted me got suspended from the school and i had like this burst of euphoria because i was so happy i stayed up for two days because i had so much energy but other than that i dont think i had any other symptoms last week tuesday is when the random crying episodes began my ex has been trying to take care of me because i would just ball for no reason and i was trying to figure out why like i couldnt be alone or else i would start crying from anxiety and then on sunday i was so depressed i was staring off into space and wouldnt move or talk so my ex had to help me out of bed yesterday i had sugar and was like hm this is a suspisuous amount of energy then today after i got a good critique from my proffesor i got filled with energy then i ate food and drank water and now i have even more because when im manic and i eat or drink water it makes the mania worse but like seriously could good news have caused this over break i was also pretty inconsistant with meds but i was still taking them like i think i missed one night dose which ive done before and ive felt compleltly fine i take mg total mg morning mg at night of lamictal i was preparing for a depressive episode if i lost but now im having a mixed episode for the first time in a year which i was really happy about my winning streak against that and i havent been manic since like novemeber anyways from the way im typing im like sure that i am and its just been getting worse throughout the day i need to take some hydroxizine that typically takes me down from the euphoria like i feel great but i hate feeling this happy and peppy and literally nausious from energy its pm and ive eaten like four fried mozzarella sticks and that made me so stuffed okay sorry again do you think this good new could have triggered it because it wasnt until springbreak that i thought i was hypomanic but its been like two weeks and the symptoms have gotten worse,2

i did an ocd assessment with my psychologist today turns out im right on the moderate cusp of ocd symptoms goody for me i guess and i talked with her about how to bring this up with my med manager bc those symptoms have been bad lately and really the best meds that im aware of for treatment of ocd are ssris which ive had mixed reactions with in the past for a long time i thought i wasnt bipolar bc i stopped taking my meds cold turkey and didnt have a life ruining spiral i was just depressed on and off for a few years until some hormonal changes triggered my hypomanic episodes again but in all this time i never once realized that my hypomanic episodes from before ended after i stopped taking lexapro that was part of my cocktail with lamotrigine and rotating through antipsychotics i was having little episodes and blips and mixed features all through that original course of treatment i never counted that in my story bc i figured i was being appropriately treated for bipolar when i clearly wasnt this isnt like earth shattering news but it is yet another confirmation that this is real and im miffed about it lol,2
hey yall been thinking about my experiences and reflecting on my behavior and actions prior to being medicated not gonna lie still have some denial you know the im not bipolar thoughts however i take my meds because i know deep down there is some truth to the diagnosis anyone ever used to get a high when they bought stuff i used to get this insane rush when i would buy things and spend money frivolously prior to being medicated i did get myself into financial trouble now that im medicated when i look at things to potentially buy i almost have the opposite feeling i get out off by it all anyone else notice that after being medicated just curious also anyone ever miss the high i sure as heck dont want to go back to that but on occasion i do miss that feeling as weird as that sounds,2
hi i really need a space to express myself right now i have had a bp diagnosis for just over years i was diagnosed at and i stayed medicated until i was however when i was i ended up homeless due to a conflict with my mother i was having trouble getting my medication at the time so i eventually talked to my doctor about weaning myself off my medication he agreed that i was handling my symptoms very well and that we could give it a shot all was very well for the next unmedicated years however just this year ive been going through some noticeable changes starting about months ago i settled into hypomania and dealt with it rather well however that hypomania for the first time ever developed into mania i am currently enjoying the worst depressive episode i have ever had in my life but im thinking its a mixed episode because i am also irritable and experiencing impulse control issues ive heard that bipolar can become more intense as you age but i really didnt see this coming i thought i was one of the lucky ones whose symptoms werent severe enough to necessitate treatment and that i could use all the tools i learned in my many years of inpatient and outpatient therapy to stay on track i do have an intake appointment for a local psychiatric care group lined up but for the first time my symptoms are so bad that im having trouble working and doing daytoday tasks i have also noticed a lapse in memory which really scares me i cant bear to be around people because i dont want them to see me like this and im scared ill lash out at them before i can think twice i know that i will ride this out i know that everything that goes up will eventually go down and back up again but right now i would help to know that im not completely alone in this,2

hey i recently found a poem that i wrote two years ago prediagnosis and reading it i was like are you kidding this is so bipolar how didnt i know i can post the poem in the comments its not very good but i thought it was very validating anyone else have any prediagnosis how didnt i know relicsmoments,2
i feel the root cause of this is paranoia caused by mania at least in my case i have experienced misinterpreting facial expressions body language and tone whilst interacting with people and tend to jump to conclusions typically negative ones for example i was waiting in line for ice cream today and the woman in front of me turned around looked me up and down and then scoffed at me i dont know if this interaction actually happened like i perceived it my initial feeling was this woman was judging me this of course pissed me off but instead of starting a fight with her i decided to take a deep breath left my place in line and walked the opposite direction i decided the ice dream wasnt worth possibly getting into an altercation with a stranger anyway can anyone relate to this,2
hi there this isnt meant to be a testimonial exactly id be happy to have that someday but for now i want to see if this is relatable to folks here ive been diagnosed with bpd and am a self identifies sex addict and video games but lets stop that list herep btw i have joined the sa step program and sought other outlets which are all well and good im just seeking validation ive been on lamictal and wellbutrin for a couple years now and theyve been a part of my daily routine through some seriously hard times some could argue i wouldnt be here today without them as part of my treatment another consistent factor is my primary coping mechanism since i was like ive had a daily routine a nightly ritual if you will of masturbation and more often than not some form of pornography it dawned on me that i might be dependent on this behavior as its a function that i literally have a handle of and gives me the otherwise nonexistent sense of predictabilityreliability in my neurochemistry nothing beats the surge of endorphins to detach from my woes at the end of the day followed by the subsequent ohsosweet fatigue and ability to sleep now i dont have the capacity to get into the weeds here yet but its causing me issues even in a peak state of stability in my life i want to know if other neurodivergents are experiencing similar sexual habits and their perspective both on themselves yourselves and on the behavior im oversleeping after late nights on screen struggling to find peace in my love life and craving the same power amp control i feel when i get my porn and orgasm i have had periods of time where i stayed limited turning of screens before bed being open with partners about my porn usage what i notice still is i crave the release my body demands it or will refuse to sleep im always half a thought away from overspending on sex toys or obsessively looking for ways to have sex i find myself over sexualizing things and ending up at a point ofwell guess ill just masturbate and coast on that feeling procrasturbation is also a like a key figure in my lifes behavioral history ive masturbated and crashed out to fill the time then woken up the moment or long after something was due or i need to be somewhere or do something tldr where my bipolar sex addicts at im trying to figure out where these two bastards are conspiring so i can fight them separately and stand against them i wonder who can relate to my experience with pseudo stability dependent on sexual habits,2
im a year old female diagnosed in and i have always had struggles with facing the beast of medications organizing them and seeing it all in front of me gets so overwhelming i just dont even picking them up from the pharmacy is a lot to handle sometimes that i wait to pick them up or if at all whether its for my adhd bipolar pain management rx vitamins its always an internal struggle the cognitive dissonance between knowing im actively making the decision to not take them and knowing i want to get better is a difficult thing to face i dont know how to make it click or how to start ive heard this is unfortunately a common occurrence for people with my particular diagnosis if you have organizational advice or advice on a mentality switch please advise,2
anyone else go through periods where they dont like to be touched by anyone ive never been a fan of contact it always seems so foreign to me never natural right now just having any skin to skin contact makes my skin crawl sorry couldnt come up with a better term i just hung out with a group of friends who i havent seen in a while and in the traditional midwestern way there were hugs all around i hated it i love my wife dearly but there i times when she touches me i feel like a stranger is laying their hands on me its just so icky,2
its not like its depicted in popular media its not fun i dont have delusions of grandeur i dont feel high or like everythings great i feel like im crawling out of my skin anyone else have this or know where i can read more about this type of mania im on meds but theyre taking a bit to work take a bit to work just upped med number two and woohooo were getting there and the meds are starting to work but its killing me and i lost a close friend bcs they cant handle my inability to take accountability for my actions im playing the bipolar victim card according to him bcs i lose focus and talk too much and am all over the place but im trying my best i see my counselor once or twice a week and my psychiatrist every month even though hes crazy expensive i just want to understand this type of mania,2
to start with i dont know that this is a hugely widespread issue for the most part i think this is one of the most welcoming communities ive ever been a part of on so many levels so i dont want to make it seem like this is an omnipresent problem or anything but ive seen a couple of comments on the sub in the past few days that stigmatize other illnesses schizophrenia and personality disorders specifically and i just felt like i had to say something as a community of people with a profoundly stigmatized illness we should know better and we should absolutely not be adding to anybody elses burden with misinfo or stigmatizing language a lot of us have various comorbidities and a lot of us have schizoaffective they deserve this space to be safe and welcoming too as someone who lurks on the schizophrenia reddit a lot for help with my psychotic symptoms and who has only ever felt comforted and respected there i feel horrified at the idea that our sub might make someone else feel anything less than welcome again i dont want to blow anything out of proportion but lets try to make sure were being respectful and not talking about other illnesses the same way people talk about ours,2
i wont say what the medication is but it is for my anxiety my anxiety seems to amplify my bipolar and my psychosis symptoms well we learned tonight that my pharmacy has to order my medication and should have it tomorrow i took my last one tonight i cant order ahead of time due to it being a controlled substance i ordered it today because of that reason i have to wait until i have two pills left i am due for it next in the morning before the pharmacy opens i am scared i am going to withdraw because i been on it for years does anyone have any advice to help with withdrawal symptoms if i have them i am so scared you guys i have always been scared about being without any of my meds for extra context i take my medication properly and pass my drug test the facility i get treatment at,2
hi all spent the last year spending heavily into music production for techno and releasing some songs got tons of positive feedback ears are ringing now and only stop when i dont produce dont go to showsravesgigs last week kept me up destroyed my earphones in a rage i finally found something i was truly truly passionate about i poured so much into this and planned on getting some gigs going and had leads and now this just depressed today stressed about money dont want to go down the tubes but feel like theres no ground beneath my feet and my damn ears are ringing anyone else deal with tinnitus i dont think its a very good combo with bipolar it is making me very unhinged,2
best antidepressant that eases social anxiety but doesnt send you into a mixed episode i should add that i am on rexulti to help combat the side effects of any antidepressants cheers,2
i find in the repetitive aspects work i have intrusive thoughts that make my face scrunch up i also have issues writing down dates on things and freeze or write the wrong thing and correct half way through being disabled by brain issues is weird any one have similar issues or point me in any direction so i know what to look up will be going to the doctor i just kind of want to get my questions nailed down for efficacy yay for being disabled where even three and half hours days can make issues arise,2
i changed everything everything every fucking detail of life i changed ive been to different schools in the past years ive changed myself tried to work on who i was made myself more likable went to the gym and started taking care of myself ive been to different doctors for different opinions therapists just to find one i was comfortable with dont even get me started on the fucking medication ive tried zoloft abilify lamictal zyprexa lexapro strattera prozac seroquel risperdal xanax klonopin and ativan not to even mention the natural supplements i tried out of pure desperation it doesnt fucking work the only combination that worked for me was the olanzapinefluoxetine combo with lamictal as a mood stabilizer that combination bought me a month of euthymia a fucking month before it started to go to shit again my mood started to decline for no fucking reason my life was going perfectly but for some fucking reason my mood started to decline i decided to go off lamictal because of the brain fog and because it wasnt helping at that point eventually i went off of olanzapine because of the fatigue replaced it with quetiapine but that didnt do shit got hospitalized because my depression was getting out of control i went out with hope for the first time i got discharged on january th wasnt really doing well but i was hopeful by february th all that hope and more was crushed attempted suicide and spent another days at the hospital but refused to get admitted to the ward again because they were completely fucking useless couple of weeks later had a mixed episode because quetiapine wasnt working for me like olanzapine was my life was completely beyond repair after the episode completely over just completely over no way it was ever getting better after that went back to olanzapine and here i am as i said my life is over this illness has defeated me its been a month and it hasnt gotten any bit better my mood chart looks like a flat line i havent had a single mood that wasnt awful in the past month and a half no one cares people dont care that theyve hurt me everyone has moved on but im here i dont know why im here like i said its over i cry myself to sleep whenever i can i avoid almost everyone except for a few close friends who dont even know what im going through i dont want to tell them because it just ruins everything i believe all people are inherently assholes its in our nature to be selfish i deserve to suffer like this not because im me but just because im human every human deserves this and more even if i were to get better i would still be awful my doctors and i have practically given up on trying to treat my anxiety because i dont respond well to the medicationobviously ssris induce mania its over its over its over its fucking over,2
my appointment isnt until april but im debating contacting my doctor i just realized this morning that both last night and this morning its been hard to take my medication because i believe ill have a bad reaction or ive already taken them and ill overdose thankfully we just cut down my dose so i still feel ok taking them even with the concern i already have i have not i guess im just debating if i should wait until my appointment in midapril or call ive been hassling her because starting the new meds caused some nasty side effects initially but seems to have gone away i seem okay overall asides from this,2
i hate when people tell me what i just need to do to get better they act like if i just do something simple exercise more cut out sugar take whatever vitamins etc my life would be so much easier and i wouldnt struggle so much they act like im stupid because i cant function like a normal person and doing something simple is the answer it is very frustrating what do people tell you that you hate,2
i guess its pretty common with bipolar disorder cause my buddy has the same problem and when i experience hypomania my hands are shaking too bad especially but is there any way out been kinda tired of this recently,2
one of my biggest struggles with bipolar is a constant feeling of boredom and dissatisfaction in my life for as long as i can remember if im not doing exactly what i know will make me happy often i have idea what this even is i get this feeling in my stomach and chest that makes me feel hot anxious uncomfortable and general just bad sometimes i wake up from a shitty sleep my coffee tastes like garbage my pets are driving me nuts i dont have anything to eat its cold everything just feels like its wrong and sometimes this lasts for days i struggle to keep hobbies but recognize that i cant just spend money whenever i want though it makes me feel better recently i am very agitated as well when im dealing with this boredom it makes me mean and snappy i live with my partner and i love him and our life so much but some days just being in the same room as other people causes the burning in my chest and stomach maybe these are depressive episodes but until now my lows werent like this what is everyone doing to combat such boredom and emptiness i feel like im running out of ideas and options,2
does anyone ever feel like their hypomania or mania isnt that bad when in reality it is im always questioning my diagnosis because i feel like my mania isnt even half as bad as some things i read or not even close to what is portrayed on tv shows or movies recently its been getting worse as ive had strong urges to do really risky stuff for example i had such an urge to climb up the stairs and stand and lean over the railing where a kid jumped off and i was gonna do it to get rid of the feeling but then i was scared that i would continue to lean and lean until i got the urge to jump off same thing happened when i crossed a bridge except i did end up leaning into it but before this episode my mania was only feeling really confident or believing i had superpowers or paranoia that everyone was looking at me and my irritation was really bad like i was screaming at my computer today just wanna know if anyone also thinks their not bipolar because their mania isnt even half as bad as they read some peoples experiences,2
im and i just recently attempted suicide and was admitted to a behavioral health hospital for days they got me stabilized and took me off my antidepressant because it causes mania and put me on depakote to stabilize my moods i got home and my husband only told me ive ruined his life my life and our daughters life shes and its clear she also has bipolar disorder it runs in my family my grandma had it and tried to end her life around my age too my mother the same thing now me i know this is my daughters future my husband says im not ever going to get better because i just dont get it i do get it but i cant help it now my job is making me go on medical leave while i am going through outpatient and i dont know how im going to afford to live im supposed to resume college classes tomorrow and i have to get a b or higher or ill lose my financial aid meanwhile my husband says he cant parent with me and that he hates me i cant do this ive suffered through years of this misery i dont know what im supposed to do none of my family will help me and they all live scattered across the country and none of them are near me except my sister but she hates me i have no friends because i isolate myself in depressive states so theyve all moved on i dont blame them im a mess like how is any of this going to get better if my brain is broken,2
music used to be my outlet i loved it so much i used to show off how i could remember a whole rap after just listening to it once but since ive been meditated my love for it is gone and i cant remember shit even my favorite songs i get wrong i really dont understand anyone else,2
so this is just a rant so sorry for taking up space in the feed when others have more serious things going on but anyway i have been in a very low place lately i was doing great for a while was relatively stable the closest i have been to normal in a long time however i had a pretty bad episode a couple of weeks ago and hurt myself and did some stupid stuff anyway now i am waiting to be admitted into a php but there is a week waiting list so i am just kinda floating by as i wait i am a stay at home dad i am on disability and i feel so awful because i just kinda sit here while my and a half year old runs around and i put on ms rachel if you are a parent you may know who that is and just let him do his own thing i love my son with every ounce of my being he is my whole world he and my wife keep me going keep me alive but i just feel like i am so inadequate as a dad i barely have the motivation or energy to fully interact with him and be the father i really want to be dont get me wrong i dont neglect him i make sure hes healthy and safe i keep my eyes on him and when he acknowledges me i give him hugs and snuggles and kisses and he just fills my heart with joy but i feel like i could be doing so much more to better his life i should be sitting with him and teaching him how to speak teaching him right from wrong but instead i sit here on my computer listening to music and watch him run around and play with his toys because its the only thing that keeps me level and the only thing i have the mental capacity to do to get through the day before my wife gets home from work i have no regrets being a parent even with this disorder i just hate myself for not being more involved in his development i know he loves me he always runs up to me saying dada dada and smiles and laughs and is such a happy little dude i just hope this program i am going to be doing will help me figure out how to regulate my emotions better so i can be more interactive and give him the best childhood he can possibly have i want to build forts with him and run around outside and use our imaginations and go on pretend adventures i just wish i could have the mental power to do these things and feel like a better father and with my wife i feel like i am always dragging drama into her life she constantly has to worry about me hide all the knives in the house she has to remind me how to be a human make me shower remind me to eat remind me to take my meds remind me to do things around the house etc she is incredible and such a trooper and my savior but she deserves so much better its weighing heavily on me and i just feel like i am failing as a father and a husband anyway that is my rant thank you for listening,2
its almost like when im extremely paranoid or going through a hypomanic episode and being reckless impulsive agitated sometimes it feels like a part of me is aware kinda like im behind a glass wall like a small part of me is saying no dont post something like that dont say something like that this paranoia is not based in reality youre not in immediate danger you shouldnt do this it makes me feel like im faking my bipolar or maybe i have something else someone please tell me if you feel similarly to this or if maybe i dont actually have bipolar and im just a paranoid irritated reckless person sometimes i definitely have hypersexual episodes too and times where i dont need to sleep much but i think that could just be high libido and insomnia,2
hey guys quick spill just so you get the jist of things im and ever since i can remember my parents have been narcissists i havent always realized this but as i got into my teens i became educated on the subject and i had to accept the reality of things because i was a scapegoat for and its tearing me apart in ways i prayed it would never but they are technically my aunt and uncle but they adopted kids all the kids are grown up and out of the house now except me im the youngest of the bunch they got my when i was months old cs my real mother was fighting her own demons my uncle is my real moms brother i quickly learned him and my real mom didnt really like each other growing up i dont know exactly why but they dont they both have issues but anytime they go around each other they fight but my point is now the house is dysfunctional as heck my aunt that i once saw as literally one of the most genuine beautiful spirited person id ever know and it stayed that way until i was about her being around my narcissistic uncle her husband has taken a toll on her and on top of that i know she knew what she was doing she was too good at what she did the charm but now my uncle is about and my aunt is they took custody of their grandkids one has sensory disorder he is a boy and now another is a now year old girl and a now year old boy the year old is a rascal he has suffered a lot and he doesnt really grasp life right now which is understandable so he helps them treat me like shit the kids i dont blame because i know they dont know any better to treat me like shit because its what they see and hear all day and their grandparents are narcissistic people which their delicate minds can fully understand just yet but dont get it twisted they know when somethings not right they just dont have the confidence or courage to speak up because they think its how life is unless they are getting tourtured physically and can show the abuse and you can see the wounds and maker sure they heal but what about the inner wounds that dont heal as quickly i can tell you i lived thru being their kid for years cause as soon as i turned and i didnt act or do what they want me to i was no good to them and i know it didnt just magically start when i was but this leads me to my point do you believe having a narcissist parent or guardian should be considered abuse or neglectful in a form i do but please share with me i know we need hard moments in life to build character but that shouldnt be traumatizing and abusive moments that last for years until you escape,2
im meeting with my doctor tomorrow and im thinking about asking for new medication to add on im not sure what to say though ive been diagnosed with bp for years i was on medicine for a few years and then i unmedicated for a few years my mental health got worse after getting diagnosed with multiple sclerosis im currently on lamictal its definitely helped my issue is that i dont know how to describe how i feel im better than i was months ago i feel okay but thats just it just okay some days are better than others but im alright i feel like i need something else but i wonder if just being okay is all im ever gonna get because im bipolar will i ever feel true happiness like i wouldnt say im unhappy but i dont know if this is was happiness is i feel very nonchalant im sure this has something to do with ms too what would you say,2
im not very smart and i figured you guys would know i live in the us and i recently moved to a new state months ago never got in contact with a new doctor i can call around tomorrow but i assume itll take me a long time to get in anywhere i only have two doses of my seroquel left my old one from the other state made it clear last time that he would not refill it again im fucking stupid and this is all my own fault do i have any options except go off everything and just cope with it until an appointment i looked it up and urgent care clinics cant help me with this apparently,2
i never wanted to be a mother nor had planned on having kids i raised two of my sister kids when they were teenagers and until they left home my sister whom is also bipolar got pregnant again and i ended up adopting my son he is now and an amazing kid who has adhd but what kid doesnt nowadays he is so happy and a beautiful soul but im a terrible mother i am currently depressed and going through a mixed episode and know for a fact im affecting him with my low mood he asked me today are you mad at me mommy it broke my heart because i know he knows something is wrong unfortunately my husband is deployed and he isnt here to help me my parents and siblings are no help i just have to push through this but deep down inside i regret adopting him because he wouldve been better off with someone else i feel like im living this big lie and i just want to disappear inside myself and die i feel like a terrible burden and it kills me that i brought him in my life and my bipolar is effecting him,2
hello im yo f and was recently diagnosed with borderline personality and bipolar i am getting started on my medication journey i am curious how taking medication effects bipolar for people who do take medications that work currently what does the medication working look like does it make mania and the depression episodes completely disappear or just more manageable is feeling neutralnothing a good thing for people whove taken medication in the past and are unsure if they feel better or are unmedicated in general how has medication effected you in the past and where are you at now thanks,2

i like what i do i used to work in a good environment before they found out i am bipolar also nothing extra stressful is happening in my life but for some reason may be because i have to sit in front of monitor this whole time i feel i am gradually collecting stress and then getting into phases right now i am on a long sick leave and i feel such an improvement just doing house work in the last two months i didnt get a single episode they were happening at least once a month with different duration i am and it feels too late to change my speciality plus i dont speak language of the country i am living that closes a lot of other job opportunities for me i would gladly be just a housewife but with current inflation it is impossible for a family to live on one salary only plus i have to support my mother also in my profession nobody wants a parttime worker any advices or just thoughts,2
are any of yall avid meditators insightful individuals and have any of yall ever meditated during either a manic hypomanic depressed or mixed episode and came to any realizations or epiphanies about your disorder im curious if anyone has any deep andor unique ideas perceptions or wisdom about bipolar disorder andor mental illness in general,2
i was diagnosed with bipolar by my therapist several months before i had a true manic episode that got me hospitalized i didnt believe my diagnosis the first time around because everything i read about mania said that you dont feel need to sleep and that you dont feel tired all the textbooks and articles say that you can get little sleep but operate on full steam no matter how extreme my manic episodes were i was always absolutely exhausted and i would need to sleep i just couldnt sleep do you find this to be true for yourself at all or do you resonate with the textbook description,2
im not looking for a diagnosis but more just to see if others have experienced this and to feel less alone ive recently gotten my diagnosis and the psychiatrist believed that the last hypomanic episode seemed like it was bordering mania and ive yet to disclose some of the following to her yet out of fear when i was depressed about years old i experienced some odd things that i brushed off for years believing i was just depressed and it was normal for depression i felt consumed by this dark cloud entity in which i believed was the soul of hitler haunting me i believed he was going to possess me and take over or that he saw the same darkness within me and wanted to rule through me i also heard my name once when no one was around and dark male voice rambling words i could not decipher he was speaking but i couldnt understand words only the noise of the voice then in i experienced an episode that now we think was mania and not hypomania id had a spiritual awakening and believed i had ascended to a new dimension i would preach spirituality whilst simultaneously gatekeeping what i thought was the ultimate knowledge i would try to link everything philosophically id felt i tapped into the powers of my ancestors and was magical and was better than everyone else i was seeing shadow people feeling entities again experiencing paranormal activity i believed in so many wild theories about the universe and that i was getting messages through animals angel numbers etc of course the mania continued with thousands of dollars spent on rocks completely changing my house decor wardrobe etc to match using divination tarot witchcraft etc the time confuses me because spirituality became a trend and more widely accepted but my experiences still feel really off either way in hindsight both times feel incredibly abnormal and now im concerned that they arent even average depression or mania symptoms please has anyone else experienced similar,2
she isnt even really a normie but shes close enough today after i shared details of my episode the advice given was balance no way you mean the thing i think about and obsess over allllll the time the thing i guilt myself over and die over i feel so invalidated and i want to push this person as far away as possible,2

i had my monthly psych appointment a few hours ago and this came just as my depression got progressively worse the past few days i had been ruminating about this for a while because i was freaking myself out reading about meds on the internet and i asked him what cocktail i was on way back when i started seeing him a year and a half ago after i got discharged from the hospital he read the list to me and i immediately started crying it was so much it all came back to me and i remembered how miserable it made me mg olanzapine mg lithium forgot how much effexor along with anafranil i was in such a terrible place for a year constantly trying to work around those meds and getting unstable anytime i tried to get off of one i couldnt feel pleasure i was tired all the time lost interest in all my hobbies and in life felt stupid and dumb and numb lost my libido was emotionally flatlined my fucking grandfather died while i was on these and i felt nothing and i felt so hopeless i had to get a job because i took a year away from school and i sucked at it so hard because of my lethargy and my tremors a year and a half later my cocktail is completely different and manageable mg lamictal mg prozac mg olanzapine tapering and thinking of adding wellbutrin but i broke down because of the regret and the time wasted and the amount of depression and numbness and pain i had to go through werent the meds supposed to make me feel better i remember initially the previous doctor from the outpatient suggested maybe lowering the dose or switching to a different ap but i declined and i regret that so much i regret that i never got to give lamictal a shot initially before i was hospitalized because i tried it for a few days and my mom thought i was getting a bad reaction i regret that i ever took stimulants or smoked or that this pandemic ever happened or that i made the stupid mistake that led to the trauma which all collectively resulted in my episode i want to move forward but i still feel like ill never get back who i was all those years ago my psych said that the brain is constantly changing and growing and healing but i want my old brain back i dont care about it growing i want to feel what i used to feel i broke down right after the session ended really hard and my dad talked me through it i feel bad for what ive put my parents through the past two years ive had to take a second leave of absence from school and im not sure if im in a position to go back again feel like ive ruined my life and i cant move forward no matter how good the new meds are and how well i do in treatment my mind will never forget that medication cocktail and those doses and how it wrecked me,2
i just went through a horrible binge eating phase from december till now in which i gained lbs i imagine thats a lot of water weight but its still a significant amount i was eating fast food or times a day and a thing of ben and jerrys almost every night now im falling into a phase where i can barely eat and eating just makes my stomach hurt each phase will usually last a couple months and my weight just swings wildly i feel sick during this phase and during the binge eating phase i just never feel satisfied my mood definitely changes with it i feel kinda low right now but that might just be because i feel sick during the binge eating phases i wouldnt say my mood is elevated but i do feel better ive gone to doctors and theres nothing wrong with my gut that they can find i just hate how i cant live a consistent life style,2
hello guys im f and lately been put on seroquel mg and tedema due to being in a depressive episode the worst of my entire life im bipolar type but my hypomanic episodes dont compare to the depressive ones as they are minor in comparasion being on seroquel for the last few months i feel like i got really lazy i just move between my bed and coach and rarely leave the house i really need help in that area my libido is non existant i feel like that area of my life is lost or something and it bothers me as well i sleep a solid h a day if not more its also bugging me because im never awake before midday and i feel like life is passing me by the weight gain is another issue needless to say so these are the things that i need help with i wish i could drop seroquel altogether but my psychiatrist says that its currently the best treatment for me any input is welcomed thank you,2
tldr im in a much better place and decided to make it a day of celebration instead of a sad anniversary heres a lengthy post i wrote on my socials in regard to my attempt up to now and other sentiments today is the oneyear anniversary of my last suicide attempt it was traumatic enough the first time but nothing compared to the second time i had a quicker and easier recovery after the first attempt but i was completely broken on this day last year but im happy to report that since that day i am mostly whole again i say mostly because there are still things im working on and i still deal with symptoms of ptsd from it and there are things im still heartbroken about but im still here and continuing to improve ive made a lot of strides and changes since then one of the biggest and most important changes i made was choosing to leave my psychiatrist and therapist both of whom i had been seeing for years it wasnt an easy decision and in some ways it was just as frightening as the state of mind i had been in up to that point they were the only mental health professionals i had ever worked with aside from one counselor i briefly saw at the college i attended it was hard enough to find doctors i was comfortable with the first time and to find someone else after years felt like leaving a part of myself behind obviously their treatment wasnt working for me any longer and in fact was only worsening the condition i was in so the change was imperative it is easily one of the best decisions i have ever made and i would make that decision again a trillion times over the psychiatrist and therapists i have now are phenomenal i couldnt be happier to have them and i am eternally grateful to have them all three of them were recommended to me by the wonderful therapist i had during my iop who i am also eternally grateful to have had if you feel your doctors arent helping dont wait to find ones that will when i posted about my hospitalization and iop last year i mentioned how my fellow patients and group members were just as instrumental in my recovery as my mental health care professionals and my familyfriends and that is still true now i have been in a dbt group since last june and each group member past and present has helped me heal as much as anyone whether theyre aware of it or not of course i try to tell them that by the way dbt is awesome and there are so many aspects of it that everyone could benefit from mentally ill or not over the past year ive strengthened parts of me that needed work i changed things and reframed ways of thinking that were detrimental i discovered new parts of myself i broke down the walls i had built i strengthened the parts of me that needed work ive established boundaries and have stuck to them ive opened up more i now allow myself to feel my emotions instead of fighting them or bottling them up i have stopped putting myself last most importantly i have found myself again of course i didnt do any of this alone ive been lucky enough to have a ton of support i have great bosses and a work family that supported me from when my struggles started when i was going through recovery my time away from work who welcomed me back with open arms when i returned to work and who still support me daily i already mentioned the support from my fellow patients and group members who i will never forget the health professionals both when i was inpatient and during my iop my amazing therapists and psychiatrist my friends who id die for whether i see them frequently or not ive been blessed with wonderful family members wonderful inlaws my brothers who i love amazing parents and of course an angel of a wife i owe them everything and i owe them everything i also owe myself for allowing them to help me and for working my ass off to heal and improve if youre still here after the struggles youve endured you owe yourself too instead of letting this be a sad anniversary ive decided to look at it positively and celebrate it i will celebrate the small wins as much as the big wins i will celebrate the positive changes and progress ive made instead of mourning what i left behind and who i was i will celebrate what ive gained and who ive become instead of mourning the past i will celebrate the present and the future most importantly i will celebrate that i am still here if youre struggling dont struggle alone you are not alone and you will be surprised how many people want to help you keep fighting and be proud of yourself for still being here today im happy youre still here,2
i have read quite a few posts that talked about how their doctor told them that they might be admitted as involuntary if they didnt go in voluntarily but didnt they just change it to involuntary once you were at the hospital whenever i have gone to the er willingly the moment the er doctor interviews me i immediately get formed even when i was willing to stay voluntarily i was always admitted as an involuntary patient has this been the case for anyone else if not how did you convince them to admit you voluntarily,2
so all my life im sometimes when i havent eaten and my blood sugar is low i get really weak and shakytremors eating a snack generally fixes it pretty quickly but sometimes it happens even when ive just eaten when im full or otherwise have no appetite and its hard to make it go away eating doesnt help even when i eat the same things that i normally do for it ive always been confused by this but it turns out that the psychomotor agitation from hypomania can cause the exact fucking same symptoms hashtag thanksihateit i really prefer it when it just makes me fidget a lot or pace ugh which is incredibly confusing but makes so much more sense in hindsight aaaaaaaa a very jittery girl,2
hi guys ill keep it short basically my phd program made me feel like im getting whittled down over the past months and i finally snapped today like the title says ive become increasingly symptomatic and can hardly leave the house or stop crying ive been diagnosed with bipolar anxiety and ptsd im wondering if anyone here has also gone to grad school and can give me some tips on how to handle it i love the subject material but i have had net negative experiences both in the school environment and the state i moved to for the program im not sure if it is program specific or if this is just all grad school programs,2
does anyone else struggle with this its like you know that your being irrational and there is nothing that you can do about it no matter how hard you try so last night in the middle of my manic episode i just had this moment apologizing to my partner for keeping him up with my crying i didnt sleep at all and i just was angry about that im really good at masking most of the time i have to be as i work in retail but then i come home and sometimes i absolutely unravel the part about this is that my logical bits of my brain know better i know that all the terrible things my brain tells me during my episodes is not true i know that i can do better its as if im paralyzed and theres a disconnect between all the parts of my brain its fucking horrible and exhausting i am medicated i am really bad at remembering to take my medications so do you have any tips to help this i also have a slew of other alphabet soup stuff going on with me i just needed to vent and could use some advice im newly diagnosed with bipolar within the past months any advice is greatly appreciated,2
hey so i regularly struggle with dating which often tips me into a manic episode and when im in a manic episode i get hypersexual and when i get hypersexual all my dates turn into one night stands in my experience and its a lot one night stands never lead to a real relationship so going into dating this time i really wanted to break that habit and do nothing sexual on the first date but i was unsure if i could stick to that because my manic hypersexuality is strong i swiped right on the most attractive man ive ever matched with on a dating app totally out of my league we talked for a few days and then met and had an amazing date we had ice cream went to a book store and art museum im trying to figure out the line between manic and adventurous but it felt nice and not dangerous anyway before the date i sent a friendly but firm text that i didnt want to do anything physical not even kiss he said he would respect that and he did at the end i even tried i said i wanted to kiss him when we parted he said he wanted to kiss me too but we should wait for the right time i dont want to mess this up any tips when do i tell him im bipolar and how much do i tell him i want to lock this man down any advice appreciated,2

when i was diagnosed as bipolar i had already had my suspicions i had read a book and articles on bipolar disorder and i realized it kinda fit my behavior then i went to a psychiatrist and they confirmed and diagnosed me now im prescribed an antipsychotic but im a little nervous to take it because what if i dont have bipolar and im behaving like i am to prove that i am bipolar when in actuality im not bipolar if that made any sense to anyone my biggest fear is that i dont have it and im taking this god aweful scary antipsychotic that has so many possible side effects and itll end up hurting me in the end because i dont actually have bipolar now in actuality i know i am i just find myself questioning it does anyone else,2
i am so tired of having to deal with withdrawal symptoms every months because of meds checks ive been on meds for years i have been taking my current meds for over and the same dose for years yet every six months i have to play this ridiculous game of cat and mouse to make sure i dont run out my gp understands this but his office staff is a revolving door of annoying i cant speak for all meds but i start experiencing withdrawal from effoxor in about hours after a missed dose lamotragine is not as severe but i know by am if i forgot to take it the night before i am currently stuck in the dr officepharmacy circle of hell waiting for meds while i am dizzy nauseous and brain dead,2
i am f i have had two severe psychotic manic episodes in the last two years both times i was on zoloft for the first one in summer the pharmacy messed up my zoloft dose and i was taking times as much as i shouldve been it was a euphoric mania and it occurred during a period of extreme stress from a divorce as well i also started taking a htp supplement around the time of my episode i was hospitalized i was also on lamotrigine at the time i gained a ton of weight from both the antipsychotics and lithium i went off antipsychotic first seroquel that caused me to gain around a pound every single day lithium i stayed on longer but i gained around pounds a month i then fell into a severe depression like unbelievably severe i thought i had had severe depressive episodes before but i was wrong i was not functional and planning my suicide my psychiatrist initially refused to prescribe an ssri or put me on vyvanse what i used to take for adhd and also helped with depression i eventually talked him into it i cant remember exactly how i was also on lamotragine i think i wouldve died if i had not been out on zoloft at that time but it was a lower dose fast forward during a time of work stress maybe months later i slipped into a more agitated mania i was also on lamotrigine i was again hospitalized stopped taking zoloft and vyvanse and went on zyprexa and lithium weight gain with zyprexa was still significant but leveled out relatively quickly and lithium doesnt seem to be an issue this time after writing a book i guess my main question is does anybody here only go manic on ssris in the past the one other time i was on one it caused rapid mood cycling and so did zoloft until i was on lamotrigine ive been labeled as bipolar i which i initially talked him out of and he changed it to not otherwise specified until i had my second one ive been told the average age for first mania for a woman is and i was but i dont think it was a coincidence they were both on zoloft i am pretty convinced i wont go manic without zoloft or another ssri but i cant afford to take the risk which means im stuck on meds i may not need for basically forever has anyone had a similar experience,2
im scared if its genetic if im a bad person if even asking this question makes me a bad person like if i search for validation how good of a person im how good persons dont ask those questions everytime i do something good when i tell someone i feel like a bad person because did i tell it because im a good person or did i tell it because i search for validation im a person wh loves to share thats how my character works especially to people i like i really believe the trauma which my mother caused me lead to my bipolar disorder i dont want to be a bad person or god forbid hurt anyone im an atheist but this fits how do i know if im like her if so how can i be a better person,2
i used to get really bored with my life and then make a dramatic change to completely reinvent myself once every couple years i miss the mania that comes right after the self sabotage and the sudden energy to become a whole new human my life feels like its at a crossroads and while i think im approaching this one correctly actually considering it engaging my therapist discussing with my partner its hard not to wonder if this is just a more evolved version of that same old urge to blow it all up and start fresh anybody else struggle to tell whats normal life and whats bipolar life,2
sorry this post is a huge mess i just need to let everything out and i dont know who to go to right now who would understand my situation so im got diagnosed on my birthday quick fun fact i guess lol and moved out of my parents into an entirely different state back in january i was doing completely fine and actually felt on top of the world for awhile i did some exams that allowed me to graduate early before moving told myself and everyone ill get a new job and start college as soon as i can i havent been able to get a job here yet so i have been doing commissions to hold me off for a while i was doing really good with that making about a week which held me off pretty well im living with my boyfriend who lives with his mom so i dont have to pay rent or anything just need to buy stuff for myself and my cat everything was going good i had to stop my meds after i moved because my psychiatrist isnt licensed in this state plus the side effects for the meds i was currently on gave me really bad tardive dyskinesia my boyfriends mom has been pressuring me more and more recently to get a job sending me links for places to apply to more and ive been applying to them the other night i had a conversation with my parents im still on good terms with them and my mom noticed i must be manic because i told her ive been unable to get much sleep at all due to my mind constantly racing she said she wants me to come visit home asap because she has bipolar too and based on her experience she doesnt want me being unmedicated and manic in an entirely different state especially when the depression comes i told my boyfriends mom this and she was really disappointed saying that she doesnt want me to constantly visit back and forth again before i moved i would visit for a couple weeks very often and that im supposed to have a job by now and that basically if im going to be doing this i should just move back until im i seriously dont want to move back though i love my parents and everything and i want to just visit not move back entirely im happier here with my boyfriend finally have myself settled and comfortable here and im worried if i move back ill get addicted to bad habits again because my mental health was a lot worse there my parents and my boyfriends mom had a whole dispute and i was in the middle of it and since then i just feel like it triggered something in me and now i feel miserable and sick and scared im sleeping constantly and when i wake up i have messages from my boyfriends mom telling me to apply to some place along with messages from my parents asking when ill be visiting i dont want to disappoint or upset either of them with what i do and i dont know whatll be best for me staying here and getting a job or risking it and going back to get my mental health worked on i havent been able to draw much at all since then and i fell behind on my commissions which is making me feel worse and i just dont know what to do right now i feel stuck and i just want to cry and sleep and ignore all these issues i havent felt this shitty in so long i cant bring myself to do anything and i keep suddenly crying several times a day when im awake sorry if this issue seems trivial or anything i just have an extreme fear of disappointing people which makes this all so much worse for me i really want to visit my parents and get on something thatll help me but im worried that if i go my boyfriends mom wont allow me to come back and i dont want to upset her with my decision since she keeps telling me to apply to the places shes sending me and im telling her i will so she wont get upset i dont know what i want from this post i just know i needed to let this all out if anyone reads this all then personal input or advice is welcome im not sure what to do right now i need to make a decision quick but i cant bring myself to,2
do you guys ever just get extremely irritated by everyone and everything its been happening for a while but sometimes it just hits me and i want to be mean for no reason due to it when i was in therapy itd happen and id just be irritated i had to be there and now im starting to do it again around my friends ive started isolating until i can deal with it but i just feel like no one else understands i feel like i cant control this and i feel so lonely im currently off meds because i cant afford them or my psych and i just dont know how to deal with this,2
i have actually been diagnosed like three times oh geez i dont want to be bipolar no one does so you just like deny it theres literally nothing valuable about this im nearly unintelligible no one can understand me and obviously people know my brain is telling me the solution is to be a standup comic im not actively suicidal but i fantasize about not dealing with it i was okay for like years fuck when does it stop im going to ask for meds but i really do not want to i do not want to be this,2
i often wonder if i would be ultimately happier with a bipolar woman who else besides us can even begin to understand our thought processes and patterns i wish so much that my wife would understand just how lonely i am right now i know its not her fault however i am pretty sure if it was the other way around i would be much more interested and comfortable with communicating and comforting her im sure its hard for her to not take things personally and being bipolar isnt an excuse for abuse i do not and never have abused her ever whether physically or emotionally i have spent alot of time in our room alone lately and figure if im alone now and married then wtf am i still even married when i could be alone by myselfcouple weeks ago i started all of the sudden getting up at am and going to the gym and cleaning the house and doing all the dishes over and over again i would rather be stuck in that mode then this one anyways sorry for the rant,2
recently i had to switch medication because i developed an allergy to the one i had been taking forever it took a few months and in that time i had a manic and depressive episode i ended up losing a good portion of friends and i understand why to an extent im very communicative to people about my disorder and what happens even when im medicated despite this people were not very understanding with me and while i understand people dont have to put up with my mental illness i still feel as if i was given no compassion at all some people did and im grateful to them but its so hard and it makes me so anxious a lot of us have to switch medications multiple times in our life and i really wish people would be more understanding to those who are bipolar id get it more if i just stopped the meds and didnt work on being better but this whole time ive been trying this disorder can be so isolating and unforgiving and i wish more people took the time to understand it,2
i have reached a point in a very close friendship that is troubling i talk with my best friend about frustrating people or situations i get the sympathetic head tilt the three nod sometimes even the gentle pat on the arm this is followed up with do you think you might feel this way because youre delusionalruminatingparanoidpsychotic eventually ill have to have a discussion but its really frustrating to see my biggest cheerleader box in my every not happy thought as being related to bd,2
i had the worst episode ive ever had since i was a teenager i started adhd meds and it causes a full episode where i blacked out and did all kinds of craziness but the lamictal is helping at least,2
hello all i am battling akathesia at the moment and its taken me out of the workforce since november so i am now finding myself trying to battle it and also job hunt again one thing is that i hear people who are happy or unhappy voice their concerns a lot and i wanna jump on that train please list what you do for work and how you got there if you went to grad school say that if you had to get certified say that through a mutual friend say that,2
been depressed for a while had first manic episode a few months ago but doesnt seem that intense compared to other peoples here i was on an snri at the time that my psychiatrist stopped now im in full depression again but he wants to put me on antipsychotics and i feel like thats a lotdont wanna do it especially considering the side effects but snris are off limits because of triggering the mania ssris and wellbutrin havent worked im on lamictal and that hasnt worked kind of running out of options id rather go unmedicated than doing the antipsychotics abilify in this case i dont feel like im psychotic even in my mania it was barely psychoticfeeling like i could feel objects emotions i started crying in the psychiatry office because i feel so bad about myself that nothing works for me and also that i might have to take some drug that leads to decreased brain volume and weight gain hair loss dementia parkinsons etc so at what point do antipsychotics actually become necessary note im not asking for medical advice just peoples experiences,2
basically ive been feeling empty for a while now problably to years which is also the around the time i had my first hypomanic and depressive episode i feel a lack of feeling sometimes i feel like im completely empty inside the problem is i dont feel this way only when im depressed i also feel empty when im happy and life is good i kinda feel like i feel less empty when im depressed because i feel sadness anger depression i can at least cry and feel things even if its are not particularly pleasures feelings on the other hand when im stable i dont feel anythingi have a few theories when im depressed i am in contact with my feelings im completely focused on whats happening inside of me instead of outside of me when im happy im not in contact if my feelings i get my happiness from external factor in contrast of when im depressed i get my sadness from internal factors so maybe when im stable im not in contact with whats inside me honestly im not sure if im even close to the answer so please give me some advice especially if u been through this thank you for reading,2
im f having serious issues with impulse control so much so that since ive started my new job my motto has been the less i talk the better so ive been making sure to hold on on words as much as possible im really anxious in general in my social interactions because i seek constant reassurance and approbation that its not hard for me not to talk when im anxious ive been at my new job for a little more than a year now and im starting to relax around people im more comfortable and more comfortable means losing my filter slowly i surprise myself with my reactions that are out of proportion and it surprises people whom have known me as someone really silent my personality i talk a lot i can be very insensitive and agressive i will do everything i need to be better than whoever is around me i want to be prettier the nicest the funniest the sweetest the most intelligent but that takes constant control so when i lose it i go fucking rogue i have a very hard time controlling what i say cause my impulse control is absolutely shit i dont know what to do cause thats when people start to lose respect toward me and thats also when people start to despise me i want to avoid it as much as possible cause my new job is my dream job and ive been doing amazing until now i dont want to ruin it by literally being myself and blunt when im blunt the things i say are inexact and stupid what can i do counting to before speaking is impossible i cant do it i forget about it as soon as i enter the world,2
the gravity on earth feels stronger i am so deep into a depressive episode i spent the entire weekend in my bed getting high and crying i only ate meals throughout friday night till monday morning one was a box of frozen spring rolls that i heated up in the oven the second meal was sunday night i didnt plan on eating i had no appetite at all but my roommate brought me a burrito bowl because she knew i wasnt leaving my room oh and she also fed my cat i had been neglecting i have zero ambition to do anything no desire to engage in any of my hypomanic hobbies no care for my health or future i made it to work today which i am actually quite surprised about but my parents were the type to work even when theyre sick so ive always been forced to go to work no matter the circumstances i just started seeing a therapist a couple weeks ago even though i shouldve started years ago shes got a plan to help me and get me diagnosed so i can start proper meds and treatment but for now theres nothing i can do besides hang out with my friends or go for walks even though i dont wanna do either right now im writing this on my lunch break as i sit in my car alone trying to drink my fucking tea and find a will to fucking live what the hell do i do until my doctor gets me proper meds im tired and dont wanna live like this anymore,2
i used to be fun and outgoing and people seemed to like having me around but ever since my symptoms started ive been so paranoid i can barely speak to anyone i feel like im on a government watchlist or like everyones watching me i cant imagine a future for myself even though it seemed so bright before idk im just so tired of feeling so broken,2
i havent cleaned my room in months and it was causing me so much anxiety but i couldnt make myself do it well today i did it it feels so good i also cut my dogs nails today and that was another thing i kept not doing that was causing me stress today was a decent day,2
the subject is the good old imposter syndrome ive been questioning my diagnosis and have been wondering what if someone without bipolar takes mood stabilizers do they feel better or it doesnt do anything,2
its been a weird year the world became a hotbed of viral death and i got diagnosed with bipolar disorder i mean apparently i just couldnt let the pandemic upstage me ive tried to deny who i am for the past years if you had to label me i often am described as an extreme extrovert all my friends tell me they dont know how i do it i stay out until am go to bed at am and wake up for work at am multiple days in a row without a problem i do it all seamlessly making it look effortless ive never missed a day of work because i was tired or hungover which is why i cant stop acting the way i do i dont know how to say no the word is literally not in my vocabulary my lust to wander be around friends and experience everything the world has to offer is insatiable but in an unhealthy way i used to think that everyone else i knew was lame i would come up with excuses for them they didnt go to a party college theyre married they dont like techno music but ultimately i would get mad that my friends couldnt handle social interactions the same way i did turns out everyone i know is just normal and i am bipolar throughout undergrad and graduate school i normalized my actions as part of the college experience i still did well in school while partying and sleeping around so why worry promiscuity and drinking is part of college culture so what if i was a bit extra every now and then recently though my disease has gotten the best of me the thoughts in my head wont go away i sit there in turmoil knowing that i am being unreasonable but i am plagued by insecurity fear of missing out irritability anxiety and no matter how i try to reason through them they disrupt my life there is such a stigma on not only bipolar disorder but mental disorders in general that it has made me afraid to try medication why cant i be the way i used to be without medication why cant i feel like myself without taking an antipsychotic i know we all need a little extra help sometime but i am scared i am scared to admit who i really am,2
im trying to reconcile whether or not what im experiencing is psychosis i do not believe in ghosts but i found a can of reduced sodium soup in my cabinet and there is no way my roommate or i would ever buy that we both have pots and are on high sodium diets i got this deep seated feeling that either someone broke in and put it there or more likely there is some sort of supernatural shit going on and im being haunted i know rationally that this isnt true but i still feel anxiety in my gut that im being haunted and bad shit is going to happen this is a pattern i tend to get really emotional about some conspiracy or something supernatural one time i salt lined my friends apartment because someone left a creepy doll in the vestibule of her building and then it got moved to the laundry room is this just me being me or am i experiencing psychosis or something else,2
i have always envied and loved how others could express their feelings through color and time by painting i am envious this was my night and i really like looking at it feels good to concentrate fully on a project to the end shortgoals,2
hi everyone been having some heavy nightmares since i got an additional med and they are extremely vivid if you have any experience with vivid dreams and such please let me know a coping method ill be calling my psychiatrist this week as well to let him know but i dont think it is medication related since ive been pretty stable while on it,2
basically i cant stop thinking about mindsets methods ways in which i should live by thinking and ruminating constantly about how i should be living my life how i should be thinking i dont know what to do why cant i just enjoy things should i be present should i be positive should i focus on self love should i focus on being self aware thats basically how my mind has been working,2
i jus need to get this all out but ive been feeling so miserable lately was supposed to take my test today for college and things ended up messing up so i wasnt able to it seems like everything i do ultimately ends up in disappointment and it shows,2
i started taking lamictal at mg and i didnt notice any strong side effects now im on mg and i cant have proper sleep my sleep consists of me waking up every few hours because my brain wont shut up all these voices having conversations in my ears about the most mundane things it makes me wake up super nauseous as well i also suddenly cannot control my anger the smallest things make me wanna punch a hole in the wall but im trying to play it cool and control it i cant tell if this just my brain trying to adjust or what if anyone has any advice let me know,2
if i sleep i wake up and its tomorrow tomorrow isnt even bad im just lazy and dont want to go to my hour school day i really really should just sleep i can rest my head and in like minutes be knocked out but then ill be so tired in the morning i know i really shouldnt but what if i just smoked some weed chugged some energy drinks triggered a manic episode and stayed up all night and all day could i time it correctly no probably not ive done this before and it never ends well maybe the trick is more weed its either live a stable life slightly depressed for a bit but getting better or ruin it all my purposely triggering manic episodes that literally damage my brain why am i even considering the latter why do i keep doing this this isnt even the bipolar this is just me being shit and making bad decisions sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep please make the right choice holy shit why do i have this urge to self destruct,2
after receiving the diagnosis i feel slightly better about my actions during a manic episode last year but im still so embarrassed and the repercussions are really making my current depressive state worse i decided to move to miami last minute with barely any money get a dog start an electrical engineering degree that im terrible at and hate oh and also to make it worse i married an illegal resident to help fund my life arguably the worst amongst other things my entire personality changed now i have a husband that i have basically told i am not going through with the visa and have straight up ghosted for months because i cant even afford a divorce or to face him blew any money i had on shopping partying even drugs which i dont even like i have no money now and this degree is taking up all of my time but i have invested too much already to just quit i love my dog but it was an extremely irresponsible decision im basically stuck living with all of these things now and i dont know how to get out of it i feel so trapped in my mistakes now that i have a clear head and understand what was happening i keep telling myself that if i can just finish school and get my finances on track i can fix it but i have several months to go and i dont know how i can live with these mistakes much longer,2
so my cat needs to visit the vets its all booked in im really upset but hes going to be fine with the correct treatment plan my behaviour is really confusing me though so obviously im spiralling a little feeling super anxious and emotional ive recently had what my psych calls paranoia fears of my house being burnt down people dying so ive been making sure the house is safe etc however ive started obsessing over it more now that im stressed usually i only take extra precautions if im leaving the house now im walking around switching everything off while at home or immediately after my partner has used something like the microwave has anyone else experienced anything like this,2
like a switch flipped in my head suddenly everything was terrible i had to leave im sure ill hear about it from my boss later any tips on not completely descending into depression and sinking into a hole of selfpity,2
i am just so tired of being in pain and being depressed or being numb and not seeing the point to life i am pushing myself to get up everyday and im so tired ive been on so many medications and none of them have helped me i really just want to give up and just not exist anymore im so tired of dealing with this pain and getting only a slight moment of relief im considering checking myself into the hospital but im convinced it wont even help at this point what else could they even try it will just waste away days and accomplish nothing,2
i have primary inattentive adhd its pretty severe and has been my entire life unfortunately medication makes me switch even while on mood stabilizers that wasnt always the case ive been on ritalin adderall strattera and vyvanse strattera was the absolute worst i was very motivated it helped my adhd symptoms more than anything but within months i ruined my finances long term currently im on nothing for my adhd i started latuda three months ago and my adhd symptoms are worse than theyve ever been latuda seems to do pretty good for emotional regulation but my employer is extremely worried about me im not focused my memory recall is awful and my personality has changed more than it has over the past years of work in other words my work is currently very impacted by these new meds im wondering if anybody has some tips on what to ask my psych its my understanding that antipsychotics and stimulants negate eachother what the hell is the point of being on either of them if they work against each other it would be super cool if i could stay motivated happy and focused but also remain level headed and sane ideas,2

been lurking for a while but thought id ask yall for some advice i am bipolar and have been stable since some lows but no manic outbreaks my psychiatrist put me on mg lithium and mg risperdone coming out of hospital in now i am at mg lithium and mg risperdone my new np who oversees my meds and mood seems like a knowledgeable guy and ran it by me to see if we could try new meds he wants to make sure the side effects of my current meds arent affecting me too badly i am concerned because these are the only meds i have been on since being hospitalized lithium and risperdone are my so called cocktail that work with me what do you guys think have any of you been on the right blend of meds but your medical professional wanted to try different thanks for any advice,2
hi everyone so this week im going to be starting my period i struggle with bp along with really bad mood swings and emotional dysregulation about a week before my period starts im talking i go from perfectly fine to wanting to hurt myself and ruin my relationships i have no idea how its going to go but things are going really well with someone im interested in but with my period starting soon i can already see and have already started freaking out because he was acting distant he later told me he was spending time with a friend that calmed me down because it explained the distance but i tend to over react while suffering with the mood swings etc i dont want it to ruin how well things are going but i can feel the paranoia setting in again do you guys have any advice on how to battle paranoia and overthinking i do positive affirmations when i wake up and go to bed they help but im looking for some more ways to prevent overthinking and paranoia surrounding my relationships,2
has anybody had any problems with oral health from your meds i developed a chronic mouth pain and no tests can solve whats the reason for that a dentist suggested it may be linked to meds,2
i quit my job and moved to a new state hundreds of miles away from all my friends and family with no job lined up and no money saved up,2
there are emotions that come along with this diagnosis that get swept under the rug of summarization its more than just being happy one day and sad the next theres the frustration of not being able to get out of bed because youre frozen by deep dark depression the sadness is so consuming you dont think youll make it one more day there is the anguish of not being able to be reliable every single time youre needed some days i cant count on myself let alone be there for another person asking me for help i wish with all of my might that i could be someones rock even though i cant be one for myself the lack of hope that one day it will get better and i will be strong enough to conquer this the feelings of anger and irritation pulsing through my body for no apparent reason my aggression toward everyone even though i know they have done nothing wrong the grief i feel when the thoughts come rushing in telling me i am a burden to others and everyone who once loved me the heartache from the thought that i am pushing everyone away and will soon be alone the fear of facing this alone the exhaustion of putting up a front to mask my many emotions and terrifying thoughts just to seem ok and normal its more than just being happy one day and sad the next there are highs of being productive with little amounts of sleep that can go on for days even weeks the manic state of rash decisions and risky behavior such as impromptu tattoos or even solo backpacking trips through europe the euphoric feeling of being on top of the world the racing thoughts and distractions that cannot be controlled the blissful feeling of being out of my depressive state the confidence that the darkness will never come back but the acknowledgement that it will the hope that people will begin to understand the many sides of bipolar that arent mentioned,2
the past few weeks have been the worst ive ever felt im a teacher and havent been able to go to work for over two weeks now because the job is just too stressful and i cant deal ive been seeking treatment for depression for years now with my bipolar ii diagnoses happening last september no treatments have worked for me all of them have made me feel even worse than before with short periods of respite in between its exhausting im going on medical leave which means i wont be able to afford my own place anymore and have to move back in with my parents who thankfully have been very supportive but it still just sucks so much im and it feels like my life is going backward after working so hard to get just this far one of my best friends who used to be extremely supportive of me just doesnt seem to care that much anymore about me and ive been dealing with that for months now its heartbreaking i have other friends i can rely on but she was very special to me im still learning how to move on from it but i just cant im sick of waking up every morning feeling like shit i want so badly for something to make me feel happy but nothing works i wish giving up was an option,2
how are you guys meeting people that are bipolar in real life seems like everyone around me has very little to no understanding of bipolar and has never met anyone with bipolar this shit is isolating enough and to feel like im the only one in a mile radius that has it is driving me crazy feel like it would help to have bipolar friends but have no idea how to even start working toward that lmao,2
hi so you know i f have the best psychiatrist i could wish for and the best treatment i finally am able to be happy because my disorder was type focusing on depression i was struggling with depression from to years old thought there was no way out today im kind of happy i am in a healthy and loving relationship that was unthinkable three years ago bc i was such a mess but theres some days like this one i feel soooo sad and lonely again and not because of an episode but because of my life i had such a difficult life surrounded by illegal substances and violence and those memories sometimes just hit me i just feel all the pain people went through feeling sad and powerless against this sh world where help is so difficult to find for people with heavy issues my struggles today are the same as every basicaly nt person but i have to live with those memories of people friends suffering when we were so young and i still sometimes meet the same kind of people year old girls drunk and high in the afternoon with year old homeless addicts im here in life in the middle juste between healthy and dying people im doing better now they arent i just feel lonely right now with those thoughts,2
like do i actually have this thing wrong w me maybe i just like doing crazy shit every now amp then i regret it all after but maybe im just spontaneous i just dont get what the problem is i was depressed then i got on lexapro then i did a ton of crazy shit amp ruined a bunch of friendships amp school stuff but maybe thats just because i finally wasnt depressed amp so i had the ability to get up amp do things what if the way i was acting after getting on lexapro is just me amp now im being silenced i almost wish i had never gotten on anything at all i was depressed but at least my life was in order unlike now,2
for anyone wondering if doubting your symptoms and diagnosis is normal heres a journal entry from a few years ago post mania ampxb i wonder if i know how it feels to leave this world have i ever been sad have i ever felt anything or have i given names to the blank spaces and am i drowning in an ocean or a teaspoon,2
possible controversial post here but i speak from my own experience ive finally come out of the depths of the darkest longest depression ive experienced it took perseverance self advocacy accountability and surrendering when it was too difficult to cope oh and tons of therapy from all of this ive learned that i own my own happiness no one else is responsible for it because theyve got their own to worry about its my body and i also own the right to know what works best for it meds eating the foods that make me feel my best moving my body journaling my thoughts all these steps pay off it just takes time im the worlds most impatient person and the universe is always teaching my ways i need to slow down and smell the roses enjoy the simple things and little moments all these things add up you all can do this for yourselves and more keep up the good fight,2
so i started my mental health journey at the age of i was initially diagnosed bipolar and tried a number of medications that either didnt work or made me worse the bad experience with medication caused me to take a break from medication off and on around the age of i was hospitalized for a manic episode a year later when i was i was hospitalized again for another manic episode finally around the age of i started seeing a new psychiatrist and she put me on abilify and to my surprise i finally felt stable happy and normal over the years i have had to adjust my abilify every now and again but can usually get stable fairly quickly until now i began having hypomanic symptoms about a week ago so we raised my abilify to mgs and added mgs of zyprexa maybe im being impatient its only been two days but im still having hypomanic symptoms and on top of that im having balance and coordination issues my fear is that the abilify is no longer working and i am accepting the possibility that i may have to start from square one which means medication trial and error and with my past bad experiences with medication i may be completely dysfunctional for god knows how long which leads me to considering possibly going on disability i know its not easy to get and could take up to a year to receive benefits which is a concern i also feel going on disability may lower my self esteem to be clear i dont judge others that are on it who really need it its just a personal issue i have i really want to work and function in the real world and i know you also have to jump through a bunch of hoops to get disability and even when im stable i tend to give up easily so yeah i guess im posting because im really on the fence about this im scared worried and feel shame thanks to whoever reads this or replies,2
dont know how else to put this i feel like my cognition and intelligence arent what they used to be it takes me x as long to do what i used to be able to do my thinking is slow and repetitive and im tired all the time i tried looking this up online but couldnt find any conclusive answers decided to hop on here and ask you guys myself do you feel like you just became dumber after starting antipsychotics,2
i want to go off of my meds ive been on them for years but they are not helping enough anymore ive gone off lithium before and that went fine i tried going off invega but i couldnt keep my shit together if i get the chance again ill probably just lie to get off finally i like lamictal but it has a lot of sideffects so id like to get off of that too i love my sleep med roserum i got off of and had really bad withdrawal from lorazepam but it helps my major panic issues so id keep that but use it sparingly my husband said hed seriously consider divorcing me if i go off of my meds im kind of devastated we were together before i got diagnosed and medicated we never had a bad relationship while i was off meds i did some stupid shit occasionally but we got though it more easily than a lot of the shit ive done medicated he drank like a fucking fish got increasingly violent and acted like i shot him when i said id divorce him if he didnt stop he was sober month and while infinitely better still has episodes of drinking way too much and im supposed to take it with a fucking smile but how fucking dare i say i want to get off the stuff that give me side effects i dont want to live with anymore im even open to other medication just not what im on currently except maybe lamictal i feel like a god damned zombie i dont want to die i just dont want to live like this anymore,2
hi i was first diagnosed with bipolar type in i quickly got stable with medication until i was pregnant in and my meds were changed it set me spiralling and i saw a new psychiatrist who again diagnosed bipolar type i came off my meds for months last year and stayed pretty stable other than depression then around christmas time hit a manic period and saw a new psychiatrist this time they said they werent sure bipolar was the right diagnosis but put me on lamotrigine anyway ive been really good on lamotrigine for a couple months but my husband spoke to my psych nurse today about maybe having some counselling and she said i dont have a diagnosis of bipolar anymore and theyre treating my autism and depression i dont know why i feel so panicked and upset by it i think its come out of the blue the fact nobody has told me and theyve now told my husband without even speaking to me about it it feels like theyve been sort of talking behind my back and think im lying or something i dont understand how to different psychs said im bipolar and this new one has seen me once and changed my diagnosis,2
i had to go to the er and admit myself for a couple of days because i was becoming very depressed and my mood seings were getting out of hand i was having horrible night terrors and even sleep paralysis i was on seroquel the doctor took me off of it completely and put me on a different mood stabillizer and and ssri i am so restless i cannot sleep without this drug even though ive only been on it for a couple of months im confused as to why i wasnt tapered off of it and im just having a hard time dealing i mostly wanted to vent to possibly someone who understands but advice would be greatly appreciated as well,2
im back on meds just under a week now and feel so so bad the meds are leaving me heavy still lingering psychosis more so at night but not as bad and now i feel extremely depressed i wish i never went off my meds i feel horrible and see no end in sight of this ever stopping i feel completely alone and back to square one ive put strain on relationships and just not functioning back on meds as i was off them this illness is a death sentence and im hanging on for dear life,2
edit my doctor already agreed that i can try a lower dose of lamictal but he generally lets me decide what i want to do when it comes to meds since nobody else could figure me out please stop deleting this so basically medinduced stupidity is ruining my life being smart is my thing its the only thing i have going for me pretty much ive been labeled a geniuswith a iq for my entire life and now i cant do basic math im freaking out its so bad i might actually flunk out of school at this rate ive been on lamictal for years and always knew it made my memory and cognition worse but it never was that big of a problem because i wasnt doing anything that hard all of that changed this year when i went back to studying computer science in college something that i was always good at but now i cant do anything and i mean that i cant remember anything for more than ten seconds it takes me x how much time it should for me to learn anything and my brain just doesnt work im a month behind in both of my stem classes even when i was in a mixed psychotic episode i was x smarter than this hell even when i was hospitalized i was smarter than this so i know for sure that it is the meds causing this not the disorder itself im scared of stopping it completely but i want to at least try cutting the dose my psychiatrist agreed that it could potentially help but he also pretty much said he doesnt know much about it i used take and going down to helped a little so im planning on going down to has anybody successfully regained some of their brain power by lowering their dose,2
thats just it no one cares about the fact there is something wrong with me they just see it as me being moody and an annoyance who destroys everything i cant go on any medication because of it ive tried everything else yet nothing helps i cant sleep and these stupid episodes are fucking exhausting i dont know what to do and i highly doubt there even is anything to actually do,2
as in before your first manic episode i feel like my meds are a crutch but i still dont feel like myself i am just looking for hope that my brain can heal,2
i was bored in crisis and with a tattoo machine im going to make a kind of blog for every time i have a crisis and get a tattoo,2
had an interesting moment of introspection playing skyrim today the theme in a lot of my favorite games is that i can justbe no mans sky is probably the best example of this im not out to destroy the evil empire or make some trade fortune can if i want but most of the time im just a dude with a space suit and a beatup old ship exploring and getting by in real life the most selfdestructive nonsense ive gotten into has been out of a sense of grandiosity currently paying off k worth of debt from trying to be a selfemployed trader there was that time when trying to be offthegrid left me drug addicted and homeless maybe just being kind and at peace is enough of a challenge and enough of a reward,2
ready to fly my body and mind feel numb as i mask myself to the world i know leaping in reality wont achieve anything so i refrain however most days it feels as if the only thing that binds me to this world are my beloved animals theyre my reason for my continued existence so i drown myself in my work to provide them with the best i may think little of myself but i think the world of them and the few i still care for,2
im suicidal really depressed i think going off lithium was a bad idea im not doing good i will schedule an appointment with my doctor tomorrow i might get hospitalised i dont care i need help,2
i am a diagnosed bipolar its been years since ive been medically diagnosed after being hospitalised in a psych ward due to it knowing this my sister and mother decided it would be fun to crack a joke on how theyre bipolar because of how moody they are and how they can go from happy to angry very fast i was so pissed but everytime i try to speak up i get shut down by either or both of them because apparently im not bipolar enough as if something like that could exist,2

i feel like the world is more complex than simple and everything just seems so confusing and all over the place im still trying to get stable with right medicines it really feels its me vs me all the time im trying to learn but when i go through the different cycles it feels like im forgetting and relearning emotionally has anyone felt like this thanks,2
ive just been diagnosed with bipolar affective disorder and it was kinda like everything was closing in on me but it also made so much sense my next appointment for my psychiatrist isnt for another weeks shes also very booked out but i will be talking to her about what im saying here my psych started me on mg of abilify i started taking it and felt so jittery and just down right awful i couldnt stand up in the shower i couldnt do my makeup or get dressed i also didnt feel like it would be safe for me to drive it was hell i took mg for days i went to the chemist that we see very regularly to pick up our prescriptions and she said i am experiencing akathisia her advice was to write it down and see if it gets any worse and if it did to email my psychiatrist or get into contact with her some way i kind of took it my own way and just started taking half of the pills and guess what akathisia is only half as bad now ive been taking the half tablets for maybe days so days on abilify so far its still horrible but id never want to feel that way again it was so bad i know abilify is not the right medication for me the benefits for me are less racing thoughts more stable mood the disadvantages of abilify for me are not helping sleep at all this has been a huge issue for years feeling kinda weird and not myself around my friends etc losing interest in a lot of creative things i used to love and of course the akathisia i am scared of a few bipolar meds because im scared of gaining weight now that i am at a healthy weight just thought id add that in there this is kind of a vent and i know finding the perfect or best combination of medication isnt easy and takes time but id love to hear everyones experiences with different medications,2
its am and there is a chance of me falling asleep any time soon im having a really bad time inside my head right now what specific things do you do to just get through these nights,2
life and its pathology arduous it seized the muscles the hanged man of the pack blood splashed when darted to the plan fate hinders on stars and caliber of what pulls testaments being circumstances and ignorance to stir the the current of the steam i not ask for maladaptive arrangements came like a blitzkrieg with no trench to brace i recognize a before and after onset of attack very young and first manic not taught how to handle such things never expect a hospital stay not on the list or plan but here it is a plan,2
edit thanks again for all of the advice i know that my husband just doesnt understand and needs to educate himself more on this illness a little backstory on me i grew up with a bipolarschizoaffective mother who really was out of control no stability ever she ended up killing herself when i was i was first medicated and diagnosed at and always felt my mother almost pushed me into a diagnosis i was medicated until she died then not again until at years old in the midst of a terribly toxic relationship this man lied to me about everything forced me to go get medicated only to use it against me and gaslight me into thinking i was crazy i found a good med combo and met my husband in i was still emotionally shattered from previous relationship but my husband stuck by me when i say he pushed me i dont mean he made me or asked me he did make comments and suggestions i think he is just afraid the meds are going to damage me more in other ways idk since being off meds ive held down a great job but ive never had an issue working anyways i think because im not like my mother was to the same extent i think i can do it without the meds but lately i feel like i cant my work is suffering now bc i cant focus my relationship is suffering because i cant open up and be vulnerable anymore just feels like a spiral and i dont like that ive always prided myself for my resilience but its come with a lot of suffering self hatred and pain so yeah thank you all again when my husband and i first got together i was medicated and mostly stable he is very natural and pushed me to try life without meds so i did and for the most part im doing okay but i struggle occasionally especially lately due to family issues and work i am the agitated type when manic and everything annoys me im also very sensitive so any criticism really pushes me anyways i have a had a few drinks and when i drink all my stifled emotions bubble to the surface and my husband is a very logical type a person he doesnt get it and i dont know that he really wants to i have really suppressed a huge part of who i am in order to stay normal but i feel like i cant do it much longer how can i let my guard down with my husband and let him know who i really am deep down i know he loves me but we are two totally different ppl who have lived very different lives i feel like a big part of me is missing since ive been holding all of my darkness in im ok with my darkness and i need to feel those things but its been so long that i forgot how to deal with it i kind of have been considering getting back on meds but im afraid to tell him please give me any advice you may have thank you,2
so i found out i was bipolar by looking it up because it popped in my head one day and adhd didnt explain everything so i did that realized it matched perfectly talked to my psych and it turned out he already thought i had a mood disorder but didnt know which one i had never brought up the manic feelings i got where id just be really confident and happy for no reason kind of like not giving a shit about what anyone thought and then having a million ideas thinking how im gonna improve my life also wasting a ton of money on games because in those moments my mind just goes do it who cares i never told him about these feelings because i thought it was normal ive always thought how i felt emotions was completely normal because i thought everyone had no control over them and because it was normal for me i had never known any difference i know for a fact that im bipolar and im diagnosed but it still feels like pepple think im lying for no reason or like no one believes me im not lying about how i feel and my symptoms but it feels like everyone thinks i am because what they say is how did no one find out about it until now i never talked about it because i thought it was normal i only started talking about it when i said i feel like only sometimes im lucid and other times i have no control over how i feel like it feels like i only swim to the surface once in a while and then im dragged back under into depression and mania rapidly cycling between the two it feels like after my diagnosis i started cycling more and more rapidly like ive kind of lost any semblance of control i had left i guess like i feel manic when im depressed or vice versa its scary because it feels like im having more frequent mood swings like times daily i dont know if theyre actually more frequent or im just realizing that im having mood swings because i never recognized them before i dont even know why im posting this i guess its a cry for help idk i know that im manic right now and ill probably think what the fuck later but it feels like what i should do right now im so scared i feel so out of control i had to take a leave of absence from college i dont know what to do anymore i feel like im just at the whims of my emotions and i hate it im so scared does anyone have any advice or support it feels like my life is slowly spiraling out of control and i just dont know what to do anymore,2

okay for as long as i can remember everyone calls me bipolar these memories of how i screwed everyone over when i had a psychotic break my mom thought that i was simply seeking attention and that made me believe that i was at the age of they detected it but when they told me i felt that my life was falling it really depressed me to find out that i did have bipolarity i recently found out that my father also has bipolarity and coincidentally shares many of the same characteristics as mine is it normal for me to get angry when everyone calls me bipolar,2

im very new to all of this i was diagnosed with bipolar ii about months ago after i checked myself into an inpatient facility im a year old female and im coming to terms with my diagnosis but i havent seen anyone or taken any medication since i left the facility does anyone else struggle to tell the difference between whats normal behavior and whats manic behavior for example im in a relationship with a wonderful man and out of the blue last week i just decide i dont want to be with him anymore and lose all feelings for him and all of these reasons to leave that i keep telling myself sound completely valid but how can i go from loving him and wanting to marry him to just complete indifference when i get like this i turn cold towards him and want nothing to do with him i feel annoyed when he tries to talk to me is that normal just to add ive done this like times over the course of our year relationship and feel so guilty later on i just dont want to rashly and regret anything later does anyone else experience this,2

so i have this thing i dont go home all day once i wake up and get ready for the day i leave and go to my moms if she has something to do ill go visit my aunt if she has something to do ill go visit a friend so on and so forth it is an avoidant tactic so i dont have to take care of things cleaning responding to mail etc i also know i do this because i dont want to be alone with my thoughts or make a poor decision like spending money or killing myself as im typing this it seems like a healthy coping mechanism but it drives me absolutely mad that i cant just take care of my shit does anyone else do this if so does it bother youhow do you deal with it,2
i havent seen a lot of people on here talk about the rage that can come with mania its genuinely terrifying to feel it and i assume for others to witness it its gotten better with age for me but i still have glimpses of that little pure rage goblin in my brain what are your experiences if you have them i just like knowing im not alone with my symptoms,2
after years of choosing to not speak to my parents and going through a traumatic manic episode im healing that relationship again i was on facetime with them a couple days ago and they showed me a note my mother wrote in my baby book for context my mother was undiagnosed bipolar at the time the line that truly hit me during this writing was life is not always kind and is always mysterious prophetic considering its something i feel like we can all relate to i needed it at that point in time maybe my sharing will be something you need to hear as well lt,2
i finally got my bachelor degree today im currently hypomanic right now and my mind is super annoying like i want to have sex with every girl that i know and some anxiety but mostly im happy at the moment after going through a lot of shit i finally got it yay,2
f was diagnosed with bp ii at years old my parents definitely both have some type of undiagnosed mood disorders but bipolar runs rampant on my fathers side currently taking mg lamictal extra added because i use the nuvaring mg lithium and mg of gabapentin i had a pretty bad alcohol issue prior to january i realized i went into mixed episodes when i mixed lithium and wine so i switched to whiteclaw and had no issues and now i just have not been drinking much like an idiot i was feeling relaxed the other night and thought it would be nice to have some wine to further calm down just had a glass last night i drank the rest and started getting super hopeless my issues with bipolar lead to my husband telling me he wanted a divorce months ago i was struggling a lot in the second half of i was weaned off lexapro after taking it for years historically i do not do well in periods of adjusting meds i was getting better by early january as i stopped drinking wine but then the divorce happened not officially but no chance of reconciliation my kids and knew he wanted a divorce before i did they thought it was a good idea because of all of the fighting my year old still spends time with me but my year old doesnt even like being around me i love spending time with them and its the only thing that makes me remotely happy at the moment but they are just not that into it which makes me less happy i literally am so miserable the only thing that i like doing is going to concerts so i bought four concert tickets for shows over the next two months i just dont know how i can sustain being so depressed i am a midlevel practitioner in a profession i cant get out of because of a bias stigma against i hate my job and its actually physically injuring me im in k student loan debt k being the actual loan the rest as interest i wasnt aware that i had bipolar when i started professional college my career requires an entrepreneurial mindset and this motivation fluctuates ive tried applying for jobs outside of my profession but i know im qualified for and i am always rejected or looked over i have no family or friends closer than miles that actually care about me just online friends i live in a very expensive city near where my husband is from and cannot leave i just feel like i exist to bring in a paycheck and give my kids rides or help them as needed if you have gotten this far thank you for reading would love any thoughts or advice,2
i have so much work and homework to do and im really struggling because everything just feels kind of fuzzy and confused probably because of the meds i have a random adhd medication left over from when i used to get those and i am trying to talk myself out of thinking i should maybe take that or some herbal pill thats similar maybe i should have some tea or something i hate that i have so much trouble functioning now but i just need encouragement or support to not take something that might put me on a path to mania i know i shouldnt but,2
weve all made questionable impulse purchases when manic or hypomanic some of these can be very negative and detrimental but many of these can just be silly and just why so my question to you all is what is the silliest purchases youve made when manic or hypomanic for example i bought a pretty black sparkly violin on amazon it was on sale i dont play violin ive never played violin or one time i went to petco to look at fish i left with a parakeet bird cage and all the fixins we had three cats all of them mousers they would have murked that bird it was returned the same day so do you have any silly innocent purchases that make you go but why that you would like to share,2
when i am feeling down i am really not sure if its me or my bipolar like how much control do i actually have over my emotional state i cant really tell it makes me feel confused cause when i ask friends and family for help they say things like just pull ourself out of it just make an effort to be happy but like i am so down in the dumps that i cant even get out of bed to pee sometimes but am i just not trying hard enough i am so lost maybe im not trying hard enough but i am taking my meds and trying my best not to make stupid decisions and thats about all i can really do right now i feel so pathetic i havent been going for walks because im too anxious to go outside and i stopped listening to music because i cant stand the sounds and i even quit drinking months ago but its not helping me feel less depressed im just lost and sad and i feel so stuck like i will never be happy,2
the past few months ive been struggling with persistent suicide ideation and even attempted during a major depressive episode but instead of saying its just a symptom of your disease i would like to walk you through my thought process the argument from circumstance right now i am unemployed with no realistic chance of getting a job my resume is spotty and the market i operated in pretty much collapsed my memory focus and cognitive skills are pretty much gone after having two psychoses in a year a low skilled job almost always requires a drivers license which im not capable of i tried furthermore i have a criminal record from the things i did during my psychosis excluding me from most jobs in my field anyways im lonely and have no support system no friends or family that can offer any stability meaning that within a year or so ill be forced to sell my house and eventually live on the streets homelessness is not a reason for suicide of course nor is unemployment but its also something id rather not do yet it is almost unavoidable the argument from harm my actions whether in psychosis depression mania anger or just because who i am have caused irreparable emotional and material damage my continued existence is a danger to society and will always incur tremendous cost through health care living on the streets and ive had multiple encounters with the police during both manic and depressive episodes while one could argue that all life is ultimately detrimental in my case its fairly obvious i cause harm without being able to effectively control it and i do not wish to cause any more harm the self image of a calm collected person is a fever dream in reality im just a unstable criminally psychotic mental health patient the argument from hopelessness you might argue well maybe youll find a job some friends maybe even love and what you did in the past might not happen again living on the streets is an adventure unfortunately it might also not be the case ive always had a pessimistic and depressed outlook and whether that is caused by brain abnormalities or not almost seems irrelevant life has always been a struggle and i do not want to continue this struggle its hopeless really i just kinda fumbled my way into an impossible situation the argument from despair although perhaps a majority of people disagrees with the following i believe society is on the brink of collapse and within our projected lifetimes things will likely only get worse without going into the precise reasons for believing this i feel like its almost uncontroversial to say things are bad and theyll get worse for the longest time i held a certain morbid curiosity for this lets see how this plays out but after my depressive psychosis which was a traumatizing hell i quite simply no longer have the desire to see it the argument from meaning commonly the argument against suicide goes what about the people you leave behind the two people i still have in my life pretty much said we get it just make sure your affairs are in order so thats not a real argument for me personally but in the abstract you might say you owe it to the world to do your best to which my mind always replies no i have nothing to contribute anyways but if life is simply reduced to doing the meaningless bidding of others in order to perpetuate some bizarre notion of you must work to live even if life is miserable then i simply refuse to play that game but even if it is not miserable which it will be because my brain is broken is life then simply some egocentric hedonism find pleasure in something i mean thats also a little bit of a hollow existence someone once said to me life just is there is no purpose or meaning to it which is fair but then not living really seems like a choice and i can choose to stop it the argument from personality nobody likes a pseudointellectual climate activist with anticapitalist tendencies that has a mental health disorder and will probably live on the streets especially not one that studied ai and philosophy especially not you can fill in all the stereotypes feel free to pick the ones you hate the most now you might say just shut up then and be normal i quite literally cant you cant just say change your personality i have seen so many death threats on social media its worrying in its own right so thats it thats the thought process im just too tired i have lived an acceptable life ive known riches and wealth love and the depths of thought but its done life will always end there is even some beauty in the idea that i get to pick when,2
i got diagnosed a week ago as bipolar type ive talked with my psychiatrist and my therapist a ton about the diagnosis and its definitely really interesting to see the way so many bipolar symptoms align with my behaviors so well and really explain my struggles i dont know about everyone here but i feel like my diagnosis has just felt so confusing i feel happy that i finally have a diagnosis that feels accurate ive been trying to figure out a diagnosis for about a year im taking medication that im excited about i feel really happy that my psychiatrist and therapist both think this diagnosis is accurate i just also feel so lost like a part of me has been identified that has been ignored for so long its really strange to feel like no one has ever really questioned my behavior i feel a little odd even just identifying with the bipolar label i feel like maybe ive made up my symptoms in my head i guess just looking to see how other people felt after their diagnoses and whether or not this kind of odd confused feeling goes away,2
ive been on wellbutrin for around years lamictal for three and now am adding abilify wellbutrin stopped by zoloftinduced dissociative fugues and lamictal changed my life tbh i started taking it at around the same time as the first covid lock downs and the medication plus the chance to recognize and indulge my agoraphobia was huge i used to have panic attacks and dissociative episodes every single time i tried going to grocery stores restaurants malls or anywhere else crowded and overstimulating and thats much less of an issue now three years later everything is still better but i have a really hard time with task initiationcompletion and do still have hypomanic episodes scary intrusive thoughts and constant suicidal ideation that sometimes gets a little too active for comfort i kinda thought i was doing fine since it really is noticeably better than before but during a recent appointment with my psychiatrist i was mentioning this and he asked if it was affecting my ability to work i said no but then almost immediately remembered how frequently i spend an entire day staring at my screen unable to think clearly enough to write only to have anxiety attacks at the end of the day because i feel correctly like i got nothing done and am bad at my job logically i know that im actually really good at my job but ykwim then i end up working late and it compounds with everything else and i end up exhausted and can barely help with housework and things and that then makes me feel like a terrible partner on the flipside i think about how much better i feel now and wonder how tf my partner stayed with me through all that itll be years in a few months at this point im already on mg of lamictal and mg of wellbutrin so rather than increase the dose past the point of clinical evidence my psychiatrist suggested trying abilify it feels kind of rough to add another pill to the handful since im also on other meds for other health issues but i just really hope it works i care a lot about my job and what i do and i really want to be able to be more helpful around the house so im trying to be optimistic have any of yall tried that mix what was your experience thank you for reading through all this,2
do you start with apologizing to others do you start with getting a new job do you start with taking it one day at a time do you start with reflecting back do you start with ignoring what happened and focusing on the future do you start with medication appreciate your support,2
he goes in depth on his struggles with addiction his struggles with depression his struggles with existentialism and sucde ideation his struggles with feeling isolated from those around him his music is dark and i dont know if there is even another artist whos music is darker and to me this is comforting it can get really dark in my mind it feels so validating knowing that someone else went through this and that i am not alone in this chaos,2

i lost my mother almost three years ago and it is still weighing on my mind i am having a really hard time with it my mom was a drug addict my whole life and a type one bipolar and it finally took its toll i was having a conversation with my dad just now about it because i needed support and basically at the end of the conversation he told me to stop playing the victim and then he went on a rant about instead of no one is supporting me crying mommy issues remember that you have a father that has always been there i feel so much worse after the conversation like i dont have any right to mourn my own mother who left when i was five,2
im not sure what this is and my searches for depersonalization and derealization dont explain what im feeling its as if the world isnt real like its a big simulation i notice behavioral patterns in people around me that are predictable and consistent and then they do things that are out of pattern and cant explain to me why they do it i feel like its a glitch i explain myself to people how i feel about things and they seem to understand and then completely disregard or even forget the conversation and go back on what they agreed to with no cares ive realized theyre just moving in their own worlds and cant really be interacted with in any significant way like talking to an npc in a video game you get the same three responses it feels like i am not real none of this is its just like a game or an experiment to interact with others at this point like im the only real human and this is world is all in my head i feel numb and detached from others like im watching them on a tv show characters i had a conversation last night and someone was emotional about telling me how much they care about me as a friend and i was just observing and thinking its interesting like reading a book or seeing a dramatic movie and i was playing along i feel we are all just playing roles and when i step outside of the roles it upsets others even when it means im just asking to have my needs met normally kind people will do the most apathetic things and then be confused if you ask them why they did that like they genuinely dont know tldr i feel like none of this is real myself or others and we are all in a big simulation i dont feel like a real person,2

i absolutely ruined my career on impulse after staying up all night drinking alone i literally cannot believe i did this i just got a decent job that pays amazing and its gone i cannot believe i disappointed my family like this unbelievable i spent the night drinking heavily chatting with random men nsfw stuff online to make me hate myself even more than i already do im a lesbian wtf crying hysterically for no reason slept for one whole hour woke up still drunk and then ended my career a few hours later when i got sober because i was convinced i was going to be fired for no reason literally what the fuck this was yesterday im absolutely not coping it hasnt even really hit me and im really scared for when it does the only reason i havent hurt myself as punishment is i dont feel like i deserve even that relief im still adjusting my meds low doses of five meds the plan is to consolidate and up the doses after been struggling still with self destructive behaviors but this is so much worse than anything else ive ever done i dont even know if this is related to my bipolar disorder really im sorry if this doesnt fit here this was the first place i thought to post,2
one of the first indicators that im about to have an episode manic or depressive is i stop cleaning its been that way since i was a kidmy parents were afraid id be a hoarder when i moved back home i hired a cleaning lady for my parents house because i didnt want to argue with them about my bedroom after coming home from work it was amazing when i moved out i didnt have the budget for her to come to my apartment the first year couple of years i did great but then i started grad school during the pandemic i got overwhelmed quickly i had enough in my budget to hire her and its kept me healthy she comes every weeks that motivates me to do laundry and throw away trash so its not in her way i wish more people could afford this as a mental health service,2

pretty self explanatory i was recently diagnosed by a therapist with bipolar ive been able to use the counseling center at my university after coming back from a year long leave of absence from my masters program likely due to a manic episode that i hadnt recognized as a manic episode at the time i had initially come in with the goal to reduce my chances of burn out when i was diagnosed she recommended i see a psychiatrist to get medicated ive always been highly wary of being on medication for anything especially long term long story short i left with a script for depakote mg to take once at night i work overnights i intern during the day and i have classes throughout the week i fear that getting on this med will affect my productivity can cause sleepinessdizziness i guess im still working through accepting my diagnosis how do i go about asking for a different med that will better work for my everswitching sleeping schedule i havent even wanted to take the depakote sometimes i wonder if the diagnosis is wrong and i fear messing my brain chemistry up more,2
ive been off of lamictal for a week now after developing mild rash symptoms interestingly and unbeknownst to me i noticed it had been changing my behavior since being off im less irritable more social and more creativefunny the downside is that my sleep schedule is now shit and that my swings are back to what they used to be which isnt all that bad since my depressive swings have always been mildmoderate its the hypomania thats the slightly problematic one but im aware of when its setting in dont really know how to proceed really because the trade offs dont really seem worth it for me i uber so i can drive when i want and the hypomanic impulsivity isnt really something i think i cant handle should i just go back to rawdogging life i just wish i had normal brain chemistry sleep hygiene is the biggest detriment but i feel like im giving up too much of myself for it,2
im medicated and doing well but still get tired out and wish i had more energy and felt awake when i want to usually during the workweek im distracted enough that i dont feel tired on the weekends im consistently tired enough that i need a nap unless im super distracted by a task or social engagement what more can i do i go to bed at or pm and wake up at i never feel rested and basically have to armycrawl out of bed i follow every sleep hygiene tip out there no caffeine after pm block out all light and sound other than watching tv before bed no phonescreen time in bed though i get a ton of exercise at least hour per day of walking my dog and walking tofrom work i also work a very physical job but its not my body thats tired out its sleepiness i eat clean and quit eating refined sugars about weeks ago my junkiest food that i eat is probably sugarfree rice putting no fried shit no chips no fast food none of that i also have adhd but am not medicated for it nothing has worked and im on seroquel but feel as tired as i did on mg as i do on mg im sober and my only vice is vaping at the lowest concentration of nicotine what else can i do im well enough to actually develop new routines and standards and stick to them,2
yes im in a down right now i cant focus my motivation is terrible at home and at work my energy is low my memory is bad ive been irritable to those that love me work is piling up and the house is starting to get messy this is stressing me out its sunday and i havent got anything done yet i always think about the time between my big first episode and my nd one when i was able to function perfectly fine without meds i was happier i didnt fall into deep depressions every few months i didnt have mania or psychosis bipolar didnt really exist then is this just the price to pay for medication that will prevent a major psychosis or mania if it is i dont think i can keep it up,2
now dont get me wrong i love my meds they keep me stable and have kept me mostly stable adjustments needed to be made for about five years now but sometimes its so overwhelming having to take them like last night i was just thinking about how many meds have i taken in my short lifetime and how ill have to do this for the rest of my life and looking at my boyfriend who barely needs a headache tablet once every six months i cant help but feel annoyed that i have to deal with this im also moving countries at the end of the year and the idea of having to find a new gppsychiatrist who can prescribe me meds and having to ensure i take enough meds so i have the chance to find one is also a lot to deal with and also costly i love my meds and i have my stability my quality of life and my achievements to thank them for but man the fact i have to take them annoys me sometimes,2
im not sure how im feeling to be honest i feel odd weird strange as well as restless and on edge my hands are shaking and i feel like im waiting for something i went out for a walk and was feeling nervous everything looked the same as always but felt kind of fake as if it were a simulation or something i kept looking at the license plates of cars passing by and they all called to me in some way or another i cant explain it but they all seemed to have special numbers related between them i started writing them down and when i got home i analized them and i have the feeling theyre all connected and theyve all got something about them individually its so weird but i cant shake this feeling what is going on i dont particularly feel any mood disturbances just a little up and down but nothing abnormal i dont think i just feel unsteady,2
ive been in a depressive episode for as long as i can remember been prescribed ssris which only made me feel like a zombie i recently switched docs and this one prescribed generic latuda which ive been on for a little over a week now everything just feels so hopeless and im scared that ill never feel happy again all i do is work i hate my job and sleep i used to enjoy reading and playing video games but nothing sounds fun anymore im in a constant state of exhaustion even after sleeping for hours at a time my apartment looks like a bomb went off in it but i just dont have the energy to care or do anything about it i barely have enough motivation to get up in the morning i just want to feel normal again but it feels unattainable just needed to get it off my chest thank you for reading this,2
i very recently got engaged and i think im getting manic atm im having barely any appetite intense anxiety and insomnia what are you guys warning signs how do i deal with this,2
i am exhausted i have spent years trying to present as this normal that people so strive for i have a tendency to experiencing rapid cycling moods and sometimes not sometimes i get to experience long intervals of depression sometimes i go on a week manic bender through all of these ups and downs i have to consistently work to survive yet when i need a leave of absence i get told my job cannot be guaranteed the funny part is this industry has horrible job retention well its because they pay shit and treat you like shit and make you do the job of departments but do not increase your pay and all the roles get looped into a miscellaneous tasks section in the job description what hurts most is the way colleagues talk about people with mental health disorders like theyre an annoying object this bipolar mom this un medicated dad if they would just take their meds i have been in a manic episode where i had to go home because the impulses were going to overcome my civility why is there no room for me i chose this field to help yet no one here wants to help we are supposed to be professionals not letting out bias skew our service yet i see the attacks and i feel them for these clients too thats me i am on that side no one knows i mask so hard and i am done im burnt im tired i am losing my shit i am in a bad low and i cannot keep up the charade being myself shouldnt be this hard society needs to change okay im done ranting,2
about six years ago i moved back home to take care of my mom with dementia i was the best chose because i was on disability and had been stable on medication and off probation for a couple of years the first couple of years werent so bad she still talked and could walk on her own i was there to make sure she had lunch took her pills and didnt wander off now shes bedridden dosent talk and its and a struggle to eat i take two mood stablers and two atypical antipsychotics plus a benzo i still stuck in painful mixed state ive have two short hospital stays in the last months i dont know what to do i promised my stepdad i would see it though with mom but every day just seams to adds more agitation i feel like someone is pouring molten lead down my throat i hate breaking my word my step dad has a little more than a year before he can retire my meds keep me out of full mania but the mix state aggravated by stress is really starting to get to me but i cant let my family down,2

this is always something ive been stumped about whenever i do mood tracking how do you log your tracker if youre manic or experiencingfeeling some delusional ideation how are you sure if your mood tracking is accurate during these states ive seen many mood trackers esp in the bipolar community i dont know how to accurately track your feelings when youre in these moments i still have difficulty differentiatingseeing my elevated moods or disordered thinking,2
do you find it effective when not in mania or depression and do you find it effective when either of these states are in effect i would be interested to know especially if you find it useful during the peaks when it feels that the effects of bipolar have taken over,2
im diagnosed bipolar i i feel like it seems most people with this disorder are high energy and hyperactive at baseline but ive never been that way ive always been low energy until recently when my symptoms really started to show is that low energy going to go away just wondering if anyone is the same way,2
what causes this exactly what causes the brain to respond to situations in this manner or is it just from the longterm brain trauma have they ever done any studies on this particular topic ive never come across it when doing my research,2
hey everyone i recently received a diagnosis of bipolar disorder way back in september even with this i was in denial but now im accepting that i need to take the lamotrigine perscribed to me its all new and scary i still dont know which one i have so i will ask in my followup but im ready to tackle this issue ive been dealing with for years sometimes i still doubt myself and think that its normal depression is this common to feel that way im in my head a lot get distracted easy when i know i have a job to get done and cry easily when upset or get triggered fairly quickly even when i promise myself to hold it together im also wondering how the pills will make me feel if anyone can give me insight on how their treatment has been working for them that would help me not feel so lonely thanks in advance,2
am i the depressed girl who never wants to get out of bed and doesnt want to be around am i the girl who dreams of freedom and new life who feels hopeless and life will end up going nowhere ill always be a statistic am i the girl who loves everything and can feel music the girl who wants to write books and get a career the girl who obsesses i dont feel like i have an identity all i am is an illness,2
the forest is peaceful being able to hear the leaves blowing in the wind the creek dribbling down gives me reminder of how the world continues to flow a reminder of how the world keeps going an example of how i need to keep continue moving forward the world is beautiful giving me the strength to be inspired to keep flowing as the river and growth of the world giving myself the opportunity to watch the banana trees grow and allow myself to grow with them the path is wet but continuing my journey because not everything is perfect to allow myself to accept the imperfect things around me my shoes are wet from the path but i continue anyways absorbing the beauty of my journey with and pushing through anyways it will be worth it when i reach my destination understanding not everything cannot be perfect at all times and accepting things will be ok refocusing my mind on the beauty instead of complaining of the walk or my soggy shoes focusing on the beauty of the walk of life and connecting to the earth of my ancestors being able to focus on the positivity and not the negativity remembering not all walks of life will seem to be perfect but focusing on the things that will bring me up looking at the trees and being thankful i have had the opportunity to enjoy my surroundings remembering to be thankful for what i have been able to experience instead of focusing on the little things that would make me uncomfortable thank you for letting me change my outlook thank you for allowing me to enjoy the peace thank you to my ancestors for bringing me back to peace thank you for allowing me to understand this is not the end,2
ever since i drank a whole bottle of cheap disgusting vodka during my overdose ive been getting the horrible taste in my mouth quite often is it a hallucination or a physical problem caused by drinking so much i havent touched alcohol since the overdose which was late january the taste makes me feel sick it tastes exactly like it did when i was forcing the disgusting vodka down my throat thanks,2

how do you deal with irritation to certain sounds is it part of bipolar i get easily irritated from chewing repetitive deep sounds ringing sounds and a list of other sounds i do not know how to ask people to stop making such sounds any insight would be appreciated,2
this is me venting help any advice helps ive been diagnosed with bd type for two years and when i got diagnosed it made so many things from my childhood make sense i was always so emotional and dramatic and known as being a cry baby basically my entire life to be completely honest i truly think ive always been bipolar genetically not necessarily an environmental effectalthough my environment didnt help but cause more spark to the fire anyway im now and ive decided to discontinue birth control i currently take the pill and have the nexplanon the combination of the two seemed to help for about five months but since having the nexplanon i have gained so much weight and have become more noticeably irritable my episodes are more drastic and scare not only myself but others around me along with that my depression has gotten worse and pet of that is because of the weight of gainedit makes me so mad ive tried dieting and exercising extensively i have been told that a k eto diet helps manage symptoms of bdnot sure how true tha is but i did do the diet for about two months and i dropped weight quick and get on top of the world thinking back on it now idk if that top of the world feeling was me having an episode i few like my bd has been managed quite well but of course i struggle day to day everyone here knows how dark bad days can be you know how it can be its scary as fuck i want to be healthier with minimal medication and i feel like that means no more birth control im hoping it helps me lose weight and decrease my depression i also want to start a family but it worries me that my children could possibly have bd like me no one is immune to pain and suffering but man having a mental diagnosis sure makes things a hell of a lot harder edit the only reason ive taken birth control is because my cycle is extremely irregular sometimes i have it every day for months at a time to having it very painfully for a day or two all birth control ive used has helped for about two months until it seems to have no effect on my body the last birth control i was using was the pill along with the nexplanon the combination of the two seemed to help for about five months,2
so for the last few months every night while im falling asleep like hypnagogic state i feel pain go through my whole body it hurts so bad but it almost feels fake because if i sit up and wake myself up it goes away and i feel sensation round my neck like tingly like someones hands around it and i hear voices in my head laughing and saying weird things that dont make sense and then like a couple minutes after being asleep i jump up screaming and run to my door and then i go lay back down fall asleep and it repeats a few times then i finally sleep does this mean anything and how can i stop it,2
sounds like a duh i know i know im bipolar i got off my meds and its been or weeks i think some part of me figured if i was gonna lose it id lose it instantly i guess so i didnt notice when the impending sense of doom came back does anyone else feel like youre holding your breath waiting to breath but the breathing never comes and its slowly crushing you between that ive started to believe something bad is gonna happen to me i can physically feel im not interpretting the world the way i used to on my meds i think i might be a smidge psychotic without my antipychotics i know i need to get back on my meds this is the first ive made this mistake guess i wanna know im not alone,2
i am f who has been recently diagnosed with bd i am figuring out how am i with it what are my triggers ways to cope and live with it i have noticed that when i am agitated low on concentration and focus coffee puts me back on track of course it triggers anxiety thats a down side but the boost that it gives to my thinking ability is something i cannot stop talking about my ideas my thoughts and views on things after it this post is a result of it too now my question is since i am new to all this is feeling like this okay or coffee triggers my mania and i should completely stop having it ps i have read on the internet that caffeine is bad for people who have bd,2
my psych wanted me to quit smoking weed for two weeks to see if my symptoms are weed related or if its my meds so i switched to a nicotine vape for the time being because i somehow still get a nicotine high i noticed yesterday that my anxiety was getting going and then this morning when i woke up i had to get out of bed my anxiety was so bad do u think nicotine can bring out anxiety i have type one bipolar and gad and psychosis,2
i get great benefits at my job including paid time off that accrues every pay period so in theory i should be able to bank quite a bit of it unfortunately ive already used almost all of my pto because of a surgery and a major depressive episode plus days when i cant leave the house to go to work i had to leave work today and i feel like shit about it i know im probably going to have to make it up next week and that stresses me the fuck out most people i work with never take their pto never seem to have a sick day i try really hard to be a good employee but my absenteeism cant be good my management is super understanding and supportive but i still feel like shit about it its not a super important job in the scheme of things so its not like im really hurting my workplace by taking time off but i really want to keep this job for a while i hate that im always anxious that this time will be the time they finally fire me,2
i always find myself having a very bad time at work customer serviceretail basically ive been put as a manger for weeks to fill in for my boss whos off i find myself stressing abkut work even when im not at work when im at work im on the verge of crying and having a breakdown today i had to leave work early because of this and i feel fuckkng terrible about doing so does anyone else have these sorts of issues do you feel bad about them,2
they would do something very stupid like so minor but for some reason i get so triggered and i cant stand them at all usually i feel this amount of annoyance towards my mom but recently its towards my friends i cant stand my best friend right now and im avoiding her because i know ill be very rude to her if we talked anyone else faces this problem,2

i am active in this colum for weeks diagnosed years ago bpad adhd nds i have a exam in an hour getting dressed only attempt had to borrow money for this in kind of depressive episode usual for me in summers however methylphenidate has uplifted mood please wish me luck god bless you all will keep you posted,2
so i have yet to meet with my psychiatrist to confirm my diagnosis but its looking quite likely that im living with bipolar ii over the past few months ive experienced my first fullblown manic episode with all the characteristic symptoms now im back in a really bad depressive state nevertheless ive really been treated like shit over the past few months by some people who were once friends in the past id have been very meek and mild and probably would have let such behaviour slide but over the past month or so ive been very confrontational about the way ive been mistreated i also went to the annual general meeting of a society i used to be president of and called them out for their causal homophobia misogyny racism etc these are things i wouldnt have considered doing in the past id have been far too anxious and frankly conflict avoidant now that fear has gone and i see willing to embrace confrontation when ive been wronged is this just a sign of personal growth or have others experienced a surge in confrontational behaviours as well thanks guys and love to you all,2
i had been with this girl since high school we started a family together years into our life together she had enough of me being a stoner we had a big fight over it im going to rehab to deal with some trauma linked to my sex and drug abuse problems but shes not prepared to give me a chance to get better and support me i never really did anything wrong she just doesnt like weed i gave everything to this girl and made a lot of positive improvements over the years but she told me she cant handle my mental illness and that she loves me but needs to focus on herself the fact that she is a really good nurse is tearing me up because she loves caring for people but im too much for her it hurts to know that someone can just leave over an uncontrollable mental illness,2
ive been with my new psychiatrist for a few months now and shes so precious like absolutely wonderful ive been thinking for a while that i could be on the spectrum and i just want to know if i am definitively or not idk how i should go about bringing it up esp since we already have a host of disorders to deal with rn im kinda scared to ask for an evaluation tho cus what if she doesnt agree or smt i just dont want to feel uncomfortable thinking abt it is making me anxious,2
hi first reddit post like ever i think haha im and was diagnosed with bipolar when i was after the classic ssri trigged manic episode i am on medication and regularly attend dbt therapy both in group format and with a private therapist treatment disclosure aside i am really just looking for anyone to use their more lived experiences as some advice for how to date while living with bd i know it can get better and that letting ones self get caught into the spiral of feeling like youre doomed just becomes a self fulfilling prophecy but the constant cycle of being a guys dream girl simply because im manic and down to do whatever little does he know i only view him as an awkward sidekick until i start slipping back down into depression only to be told im a little much soon as i begin feeling depressed again theres many other questions and anxieties i have regarding letting myself be loved but that might make this post a little too long gt on a separate note whether or not i am sad i got dumped again i can be happy daylight savings happened and i can now relish in the extra sunlight plus in addition to lithium i had armodafinil added to my regimen and it has helped immensely with my adhd and i am in the process of titrating lamotrigine which i am hopeful will help even more,2
how are you supposed to tell somebody be it a mental health provider or a friend to confide in that youd rather be dead than have to live with bipolar disorder im not suicidal im just exhausted the help ive received has been minimal at best my original diagnosis was years ago and the treatment was and still is a joke i was never the best patient but my doctor told me that i was the bipolar poster child i lived at home with my single mother who moved to a different apartment at least once a year she was a victim of domestic violence the incident occurred around and this man the abuser played a minimal role in her life in the following years even though hes out of her life completely now she will still play the victim card as shes likely consumed by thoughts of the event that being said she refuses to confront her trauma she played little to no part in helping me get any help for my mental illnesses or her own due to constantly moving when i could get any kind of professional treatment it was never long lasting i wasnt able to stay in therapypsychiatry and i surely wasnt able to stay on a medication long enough to tell if it was beneficial or not this led to episodes of mania and depression that then led to hospitalizations that shattered my trust in everyone my mother moved out of the apartment we lived in when i was from that time until i was i rapidly cycled through manic hypomanic psychotic manic and crippling depressive episodes with great intensity i wasnt able to tell where the mania ended and the depression began i was mostly manic which meant i didnt need treatment because i felt like a god completely untouchable i got arrested lost my job and totaled my car my mother had put me up in my own onebedroom apartment after losing my job i didnt have any income with which to pay my rent i lost the apartment too and ended up homeless i started to get back on my feet with a lot of help from friends family and my boyfriend at the time i started selfmedicating with cannabis and the symptoms actually started to subside for a little while i certainly wont say that its an effective treatment method for bipolar disorder because i was still cycling but i wasnt moving through episodes so quickly for the past years ive noticed annual depressive episodes with shorter less severe hypomanic episodes i currently have a psychiatrist whose not willing to give me anything other than abilify and hydroxyzine which is basically just benadryl but at least it helps me sleep at night im on the waitlist for therapy with no openings in the next days at least i have a stable job steady income a car and a place to live i try to get to the gym times a week i do yoga almost every day things should feel better but they dont im tired of taking care of myself im tired of babying my mental health im tired of trying to learn about bipolar disorder on my own because nobody ever educated me about my diagnosis i do not have it in my anymore to keep doing all of this,2
ive been diagnosed with bipolar since i was i spent over a year in and out of hospital until they came to the conclusion of bipolar disorder ii my mood swings are rapid and hard to control im currently on sodium valproate lamotrogine catapres lamitan ive read a book to understand my diagnosis better but i still struggle every day ive lost jobs in the past months due to mood swings into an irritable mood causing me to just leave when im feeling overwhelmed or on the other hand getting really depressed and breaking down at work feels like bipolar is taking over my life i cant find a psychologist that i can work with my psychiatrist just keeps tweaking my dose medication isnt gonna be the fix to all my problems im still always gonna have rapid mood swings anyone able to help me with any coping strategies or how they keep up with their mood swings,2
i dont tell anyone this only my immediate family and one other friend knows we were talking about one of our mutual friends who also struggles with mental health and i told her that im bipolar she said oh that makes sense im more stable than i have been in years so hearing that was just like damn is it that obvious how do people normally react when you tell them,2

feels like if i dont live my life as some sort of tortured artist my mental illness will be for nothing and my life will be a sham and ill be nothing but a victim to my own delusions idk tho,2
after having many manic episodes which i tried to hide i was diagnosed with bipolar rapid cycle mixed state mania all that jazz what i experience doesnt seem to be consistent with what many other people feel before a full blown manic episode i feel great all my problems melt away and i hardly sleep at all this makes sense to me once i pass that phase things become very extreme i can only describe it as absolutely excruciating like being in hell like im on a ton of amphetamines and the most extreme anxiety i have ever experience it never stops or takes a break i never sleep or even sit down all i can do is pace around my house all day and night for days on end my heart is beats out of my chest the entire time it breaks me and ill do anything for relief the last time i was manic after taking seroquel for a few days it brought me down to a point where i felt like i was on cocaine all the time that i could attleat tolerate does anyone else have horrific manic experiences this doesnt seem to be consistent with everything ive read and its been bothering me for years id appreciate any input thanks ampxb on a positive note i havent had a manic episode for almost a year mg of lamotrigine does a great job keeping me down vraylar was very effective as well but the side effects were more than i could handle i now take bupropion for depression which almost pushed me into mania once when i was on a lower dose of lamotrigine before i was diagnosed prozac pushed me into the worst manic episode i had ever experienced,2
i had an rough start to daylight savings but seemingly stable today i had my doctors appointment and my hair appointment which were both positive experiences and from then on i was go go go hard to sit still i eventually drove hr to my parents house and my mom mentioned that i seem kind of borderline manic i trust her when it comes to bipolar and something clicked that she was right so of course on my drive home im having this realization i was angry and irritated and im nervous so i texted my doctor incase any kind words are appreciated,2
i have definitely noticed a lot of changes in my mood and the way i treat others and others have seen my growth too i actually want to be productive and be a functioning member of society but theres a part of me that wants to self destruct theres this voice telling me to stop taking them and im afraid of whats going to happen if i actually do stop does this happen to anyone else,2
i developed a serious problem with my tobacco use last year i used to smoke about half a pack a day fairly reliably but in the wake of a very stressful crosscountry move my consumption spiked to smokes a day and i havent been able to get it back down yet i have bp with psychotic features and my own therapist said he doesnt know anyone with a psychotic mood disorder that doesnt smoke so im not sure if actually quitting is in my future ive tried before using patches and after two weeks i felt like i had a rabid rat scratching around in my head however i do think getting back to half a pack or less is doable my current plan is twofold replace some of my daily smokes with nicotine gum and instead of having the whole pack with me out on the porch where i smoke i keep them inside and only take with me outside when im done ill set a phone timer for hours and not smoke until it goes off hopefully this will get me down to around or less a day at which point ill either smoke every hours or only have one at a time perhaps both my therapist is a big fan of the harm reduction method of dealing with substance use yes i know that any smoking at all is bad for me but so is completely losing my mind and raging its a balance does anyone have any thoughts regarding my plan or any additional tips that may be helpful ive been smoking since i was a teenager now so its a deeply ingrained habit i know i can break habits because i recently stopped smoking weed all day every day after years though i still sometimes have a tiny edible at night to help with sleep and bad dreams grateful for any advice or support anyone has to offer,2
i just accepted a job offer yesterday for a new job i will be starting in a couple of weeks this will be my first adult fulltime job so im feeling pretty excited and a little nervous at the same time i wanted to reach out and ask if anyone has any tips when it comes to starting a new job for people on the bipolar spectrum since we face unique challenges how have you found success what do you wish you did differently,2
does anyone use a steroid inhaler for any pulmonary issues i have severe asthma unmedicated for years now i can no longer get enough air into me it feels like i have to gasp anywho i have to go back on an inhaler which really helps but it never dawned on me that inhalers use steroids which is the number one drug that will put bipolar into mania i was wondering if this includes the inhaled type i wanted to check if anyone here uses the inhaler or if someone had any info to relay any experiences knowledge or tidbits would be great and appreciated thank you,2
today has been one of the worst days in a long time out of so many countless times i have wanted to just give up and end it i kept going thought i was getting a loan so i could get out of debt and actually have some money to get things i desperately need since i havent worked in over months and have had since i recently got a lawyer to try and get ssi and last week i finally found out how to apply for general aid since months ago the welfare office wouldnt tell me how to and kept saying they only had it for families so the loan company that pretty much got all of my info and bank turned out to be scammers and citibank is absolute trash and their fraud department is shit so if i wasnt already experiencing enough stress and severe depression life decided to give me that too then today sunday i have been looking forward too because i was finally going to see my fwb that i havent seen in quite some time and i really like himfallen for him and even more excitement was besides just hooking up he invited me to ax throwing so i just felt so giddy but he informed me tonight that he had to cancel due to something about his excustody issues so here i am completely broken in every way and tired to keep living i really cant keep tryinggoing i need to get off of this ride called life,2
hi everyone i was just wondering if type people can have issues with spending too much money or if that is exclusively type i dont think im hypomanic right now i think it was just overstimulationi went to a local comicon with my brother i didnt spend a ton but i bought more than i intended and i feel it was a bit more impulsive i think im just really anxious right now ive had concerns about turning into a hoarder for years runs in my family but ive been aware and trying to work through those issues idk im just really anxious today and i wanted some feedback from you guys cuz you always give me great advice i appreciate this sub so so so much,2
i saw my therapist on monday she saw that i had cut myself and made me get it checked out at the er because she said i needed stitches i didnt think it was that bad well stitches and days in the psych ward later i was discharged today from my th hospital stay i am so done dealing with this im just venting and want to hear your frustrations too so what are you sick of dealing with,2
does anyone else have this happen to them its very strange i remember maybe when i was i would be confused as to if music was actually playing it doesnt happen too often but its peculiar when it does i became more consciously aware of this when i was maybe i remember being restless because i could hear music but it was too clear for it to be real i went outside my bed and didnt hear anything i was talking to my psychiatrist maybe days ago about it if you want you can take a quick scroll through my post history but basically got sexually harassed badly from a supervisor he told told me sexual things about my body and told me he liked sliding in and coming inside when i reported it the manager cut my hours to zero i have to pay for rent and food not to mention how it felt to muster up the courage to report it and then right face retaliation ive never experienced this kind of devastation before i cant even describe how painful the act of retaliation in itself was i was aware i might not be believed but i didnt think id get punished so i told my psychiatrist about it and almost cried im still processing this information and im struggling i really am sometimes its music playing more often actual music will be playing and i hear an actual person singing along with the song but they arent its the most bizzare thing i have to stare at their lips and they wont be moving but i hear their singing very clearly has anything like this happened to others before but thank god for meds ive dipped in and out of suicidal fantasy because of it but overall its been ok i still have panic attacks when my throat closes up and i have to step away to cough it out andor drink water but again thank god for meds im not going to ask for a higher dosage yet though i think im stable if not for this happening anyways thats such a tangent so i guess thats a question rant i have for yall,2
considering the fact that ive nearly died a few times been hospitalized times and really been through hell i dont want to have a kid and see them go through something similar i still want to have a family some days but im not sure its worth the risk not sure how to think about this problem,2
how does weather affect you i think weather hitting me as hard as it does affects my belief in the validity of my disorder yall know that feeling if i just tried a little harder i wouldnt suffer with that,2
im aware that im probably in a manic episode rn but still ireland sounds kinda nice like financially its no issue i speak the language and im a european citizen so i dont need a visa or anything hell i dont even need a work permit to work there and my health insurance works there just fine so why not right idk it sounds good to me rn but i already went to italy a few years back in a manic episode and ended up broke and if it hadnt been for my dad back then i probably would be still living on the streets there so idk if moving is the best idea maybe just a vacation,2
hey everyone i am far from a inspirational speaker but i wanted to just hop on and say that when it comes to my bipd i feel i am a much stronger person because of it i grew up with a mom who likely had the disorder as well but took the path to meth as her escape and my dad was always working and never there i grew up on my own and didnt find out i had the disorder till i was in my late teens i wasnt able to go to college and i struggled to find work that was a fit and take care of myself for a bit but now i am happy to say i found the best job and make more money without a degree than most this is not me bragging i say all of this to show that i think we all forget sometimes that while having this disorder is a struggle it can teach us a lot of lessons it also allows many of us to think differently and that can be a benefit the problem is finding a way to get to stability to be able to use it in a way that doesnt make us selfdestruct i know its hard understatement of the year and everyone has to find thier own path because it is definitely not one size fits all i hope anyone who sees this knows there is hope its the small wins that keep it alive small ones lead to larger ripples in life anyway just wanted to share my two cents if its not for you feel free to pass on by not looking for hate mail,2
i read that bd and chronic pain are commonly paired together but i havent met doctors or therapists who have had experience with both at the same time i was diagnosed with fibromyalgia even before my bd diagnosis makes me wonder if its really common of if thats just internet facts usually when i wake up with my entire body stiffin pain and my energy levels sapped im having a down day and the opposite is true when im elevated also my days of no pain and not enough sleep crash into a downward spike so it makes sense that i wear out because of that anyway curious to hear your experiences what you do to mitigate the pain etc,2
after receiving my diagnosis when i recall times i felt completely euphoric was i mistaking mania for happiness or was i actually just happy then does this make sense does anyone else feel this,2
walmart of course,2

i am coming out of a bad illness pneumonia or bronchitis now that am i am starting to feel better i am starting to feel euphoric like mania is coming on its like feel so horrible for so long and seeing a light at the end of the tunnel is pushing me into mania has anyone experienced this,2
i wont act on them but saying them out loud more has made my boyfriend concerned its been a very rough week for me and i am so wound up i just say them to vent out my frustrations but i get that its not normal my medication had not been effective and i think its time to make a change but im scared of the switch messing with me and i get those auditory or visual hallucinations again just letting this thought out so thank you for reading if you have,2
i know theres a chance somone can be bipolar and have borderline personality disorder was it difficult for someone who has both bipolar and bpd disorder to get diagnosed i know some symptoms overlap but from what i know what helps bipolar be diagnosed officially is the clear cut mood swings correct me if im wrong and i assume bpd effects those manic and depressive episodes let me know ur experience,2

content warning hello people i am writing to you because i need help please excuse me first of all because english is not my first language i am desperate i am destroyed i am bipolar and borderline i am in a relationship with someone who was perfect for me at first and has since neglected me disrespected me ignored me and blamed me for everything because of my disorder before i met him i had managed to rebuild myself to go back to work after a year break i was diagnosed in since then i have been living in hell he lived far away from me kmmiles and we tried life together but thats when my disorder revealed itself he was constantly on the computer talking down to me having horrible outbursts and insulting me he even threatened to kill himself and jump off my balcony and i tried to hold him back and thats when i had my first boderline crisis where i started screaming in pain and wanting to end my life i called him parents to warn them of his actions and when they called my boyfriend said everything was fine while i was crying in the back and they could hear me a lot of things happened and i asked him to go home he lives with his parents since then its been hot and cold between us one day im his queen the next day he barely pays attention to me and when i criticize him for not even asking if im okay he says because you think im your knight in shining armor when for me its the minimum for any social contact you should know that from the beginning of our relationship i was threatened with a knife by one of his family members and insulted and while we were abroad in a remote place i didnt know his family consults a lot of medieums psychics card readers and all of them say that i am the devil and not made for their son while i have never shown anything but goodness kindness and compassion despite what they made me go through recently i learned that they would be persuaded that i raped their son and that my first goal is to kill him while i have never raised my hand on someone they even told me while her sister wanted hut me with the knife that it was ok because the devil is inside her and so it means that its not her fault and they didnt event ask if i was fine once last week was the worst of all i hurt myself i hit my head multiple times during his present and i tore my face off hit myself with an alter because i heard his parents on the phone saying again that i was going to kill him and he did nothing to stop it and instead he left when i could have killed myself i am stuck in this relationship i dont know how to get out of it i feel like i cant see any way out because i feel like no one will want me because im crazy and i dont want to live with someone like him nor do i want to start a family with him because of the principles he may have and his family i cant tell you everything but the story of the knife already tells you a lot i need help my caregivers dont tell me anything they listen to me and thats it no one understands me the more i talked to him about my illness and how to help me if i was neglected the more he did nothing when we lived together and he insulted me i took it upon myself at first and went to him with a big smile and hugged him as he pushed me hard and said you disgust me to then tell me sorry i love you more than anything you cant even imagine i will never leave you alone again i will do the work for both of us as you have done for the past months everything its over im not going to abandon you anymore its up to me to make sure that you become again the one you were before my family and i broke you then suddenly its youre responsible for everything its is because you are hypersensitive his family hates me because im too pretty too nice too cuddly to be true when im just me i cant take it anymore yesterday and this morning i wanted to end it i cant tell myself that im going to get out of this i cant tell myself that im going to manage to escape of him because im hooked in spite of myself and i dont know why because we no longer live together and its a daily suffering hes h on his computer he just plays he has nothing to talk about we dont share anything anymore he was different at first it was amazing then he showed his face when he moved in with me i just asked him again if we could call because i need help because im in pain im taking xanax for the first time in my life in addition to my usual treatments when ive always managed to do without and even with that it doesnt work im begging you help me advise me i dont know but i need help from people who understand me thank you very much,2
i feel like im too hard to love im in my late s and i have bp ii ive been medicated and going to therapy regularly for years but i still have mood swings etc i thought i managed it well im a lesbian and i try really hard to make relationships work but in the end im always too much i even escaped an abusive one it hurts so badly especially when i think about the fact that in multiple relationships when my partners were going through their depressions not bipolar but reg depression i held them down to the point of putting their needs and feelings above my own and neglecting myself which i now know is unhealthy and then they get betterbut the second i start struggling im too much and they dont know if they can do it its frustrating because im really upfront about the fact that i have bp ii and theyll say it doesnt matter etc but when the symptoms show up they bail if you ask my exes or anyone ive dealt with romantically times out of theyll describe me as sweetbubbly and one said i was amazing but if thats true why cant they love me i just want to be loved i want to get married one day and maybe have a child and live happily ever after but i feel like thatll never happen for me or it wont last because ill have an episode and everything will be ruined,2
my last post was removed for being pseudoscience fair enough here are a few sources that recommend eating at least g protein per kg of bodyweight httpsneurosciencenewscomhighproteindietdepression a new study that focused on nutrition and mental health of adolescent athletes found an association between high protein consumption and a decrease in symptoms of depression httpspubmedncbinlmnihgov the indicator amino acid oxidationbased requirement values of and g proteinkgday and the reanalysis of existing nitrogen balance studies are significantly higher than current recommendations therefore there is an urgent need to reassess recommendations for protein intake in adult humans httpsexaminecomguidesproteinintakereferences higher protein intakes increase satiety which is particularly helpful if youre trying to cut calories as part of a weightloss diet httpswwwhealthharvardedubloghowmuchproteindoyouneedeveryday the recommended dietary allowance rda for protein is a modest grams of protein per kilogram of body weight the rda is the amount of a nutrient you need to meet your basic nutritional requirements in a sense its the minimum amount you need to keep from getting sick not the specific amount you are supposed to eat every day as you can see making sure you eat enough protein improves depression symptoms helps weight loss but is not a panacea which we struggle with and is generally deemed to be safe the mainstay advice is at least g protein per kg bodyweight it is generally recommended to get this protein from plant sources and also engage in physical activity,2
basically the title im looking for a mood tracking app that can weight my entries based on the time i recorded them all of them i tried an entry counts as one so if i feel awesome thats a and for the evening i feel terrible thats a it counts as my day was a but in realty if felt awesome for like hours and terrible for would be useful if it would count as i feel like that would a more accurate representation of my feelings at the end of the day,2
i have a deductible so getting saphris is month it was a miracle drug when i was on it vraylar has been suggested for me so many times but once again is super expensive any loopholes in getting either of these meds my doctor was going to try to reach out to a drug rep to see if we can get samples and for how long both of us hesitant bc then i might have to go off on zyprexa now open to any other meds that might help stabilize that are million dollars,2
after years of getting nowhere with ssris therapy and functional medicine i have finally been diagnosed with bipolar i feel anger at my parents and doctors for not helping me when this started showing up in high school i am now i will be starting medication next week after my psych goes over my metabolic panel i have a good job now software engineer and am repairing myself financially for all the excessive spending and credit i took out but i feel so alone in my relationships and sometimes think i will never be able to be a wife and mother with this disease i feel grateful for this diagnosis as i can now begin to forgive myself for all my outbursts in the past but the grief is so heavy over the time i lost and how much this damaged my self esteem over the years is it really possible to begin again after starting medication and therapy looking for some serious inspiration here love to everyone in this community,2
im in the us and im taking mg of lamotrigine daily my psychiatrist recommended talk therapy but i declined due to cost he also prescribed adderall but i couldnt tolerate it due to insomnia i sometimes do cbt workbooks and im in a dbt skills training group these were never recommended by a doctor but i think they help edit adderall was prescribed for my adhd diagnosis i was also diagnosed with an anxiety disorder with generalized anxiety and obsessive compulsive features but i was never prescribed a medication for this condition,2

does anyone have any tips on dealing with a mixed episode i really dont want to go to the hospital cause being isolated from my friends pets and music makes everything so much worse i also have trauma from a past hospitalization so even the idea of it is really triggering i just keep fluctuating between sobbing being fine super happy and angry i contacted my psychiatrist and i got my appointment moved up to tuesday but im just really overwhelmed right im just listening to music to try to stay calm but my brain is just really loud and i feel like im losing it i just really dont know how to be ok right now and need some ideas for staying as stable as possible before i can see my psychiatrist,2
does anyone else still experience hyper vigilance during a depressive episode i feel as though it actually gets worse and i hang onto every word and each of the tones i am prone to selfisolating but i am the sole income earner and it freaks my spouse out when i hit my lows and i cannot get the energy to get to work the fear is i tend to cry for random things and i work in a super fast paced environment which is overwhelming when i can barely brush my teeth i wake up with anxiety daily but during a depressive episode it is crippling how do i explain the ideation going up i just want to sleep and cry and i hate the anxiety people do not realize the high correlation between an anxiety disorder being comorbid with bd waking up is literally the hardest part of my day,2
a manic episode read til the end should i call this girl on the phone i need you all to be brutally honest i sent a whole paragraph to a friendacquaintance about how i didnt like this girl and had this whole plan not to sit next to her shes like the most hated girl in school the one i didnt want to sit by i made this whole weird plan about her getting there early and bringing binders that are labeled the sport i play on it to pretend we are planning sports camps then said it would be good for national honors society honestly if you guys want more information about the message i sent to her i can copy and paste it i just really dont want to because its embarrassing and hard to look back on she responded well even though she hated her for a while too she just said shes going through a lot just smile which is a perfect mature answer i talked to her when i wasnt manic about how she is a really good remodel and i inspire to her and she really liked that but before i did that important part i texted my other friendidk what we are now about it i said in voice memos that i was manic and wrote a whole paragraph about how i hated this girl then sent it to my other friend this other girl who i was talking about before i wrote important part is someone she would say rather be friends with then me then i spammed her with tiktoks afterward the voice memo because i told her i didnt want to be embarrassing by it in the future i dont know what i said it was clearly something id never say the real problem is her mother has bipolar but like the stereotypical bipolar not something that i would be like she says stuff that you could probably image very disfunctional women and the father is too this was probably a huge trigger for her i forgot about it until i tagged her in a post and left me on read then i asked her questions about the sport and she was never a dry texter and said stuff like yes no sure i realized then and remembered what happened i texted her to ask if i could call her tomorrow and she said sure that was like days ago though im not sure whether to call her text her or even address this situation if i did address it how would i would i call her text her or this is just a very hard situation and idk what to do please help me,2
i have recently moved in with my partner from across the nation we had known each other for a long time since we were in the same communityfocused nonprofit organization we had spent a substantial time building an intimate rapport with each other and we began to fully believe we were madly in love with each other unfortunately when i moved in the true depth of my mental unwellness quickly forced its way to the surface my bipolar disorder shares a dangerous comorbidity with various other mental injuries to include combat ptsd from my time in the marine corps community trauma from being raised in poverty and general childhood trauma which has resulted in an additional major depressive disorder diagnosis my mood cycles rapidly as in several times in one day rapidly the resulting agitation fills my head with various examples of why the relationship will never work despite her initial fervor to cater to my every need now shes exhausted beleaguered and on the precipice of lapsing back into previous trauma behaviorshe has ptsd from witnessing her exfiance shoot himself in the head right in front of her i have become the single most stressful thing in her life and ive repeatedly attempted to leave the relationship as a result but she would refuse to let me leave im exhausted and i have a maelstrom of dark thoughts swirling through my head our relationship has devolved into resentment petty squabbles and she no longer has the energy to convince me to stay when i feel compelled to flee from the relationship even though she states she still wants me to stay even if she doesnt have the energy to stop me from leaving i cant seek solace in my partner because we have become a point of contention in each others lives and if i keep venting to my best friend shell begin to grow resentful of my partner for being what she may perceive as unhealthy for me even though i share a large portion of the blame for causing our relationship to devolve to this point she constantly states how she needs support and cannot withstand the capricious nature of my mood swings on her own which breaks my heart to hear because now im fully convinced that i am far too much more trouble than im worth and that i am no where near at a point in my mental health recovery to be a healthy boyfriend who has experienced something similar and how did they navigate such an emotionally compromising situation,2
so i havent had much luck with mood stabilizing meds i started another new one a few days ago tegretol im just wondering if anyone has been on it before and how it worked for them,2
my eyes hurt this is now my th piece in two days i guess i could be doing much worse things right now at least im improving at something d,2
i have bipolar and an important person ive been seeing for quite a while has bipolar we started matching cycles and sometimes we inevitably trigger each otheri know when to give him space specifically when he is going through his lows and withdraws from texting and meeting up lately it has been going on for longer than usual and am getting a little bit worried as it is triggering my depression and my anxiety as he leaves me on read i cannot understand if he is ghosting me or if he just needs space i am willing to give him space for as long as it is needed but sometimes i do need reassurance as well i am deeply missing him and i dont know what to do any suggestions pieces of advice i am willing to read anything that can help me understand better the situation as i am fairly new to bipolar and i barely understand myself sometimes edit typo,2
came here to rant can someone on this heavenly earth tell me why credit card companies dont have a manic episode forgiveness like sorry im not paying my bill right now im out buying shit that will entertain this manic episode for maybe whole days sorry i missed a payment i didnt really care to view the statement right now because im out living life no i have no idea if those charges are fraudulent i was living in the moment needless to say my balance is high for someone unemployed anyone else avoiding looking at their credit score cant tell how many payments ive missed cant win here,2
thats all really im just really proud of how far i have come at some points over the past few years i really didnt think i would make it this far life is slowly becoming better and im beginning to love it and myself again there is hope,2

i used to be able to small talk go outside without my adrenaline kicking in making eye contact focusing on reading fight through the days i didnt feel great and get shit done which is not solely a bipolar problem its a human problem the worst part is i feel like i cant relate to anyone earth doesnt feel like home anymore,2
i never knew going off texting someone a million texts was me being manic telling them borderline cruel things was being manic i didnt know it could all escalate that going through more trauma could affect me the way it has dammit i thought i had things under control just because i used to be productive about my mental health my brain hurts now when things get too much i became violent i rage now im tired i used to just curl up and cry i spent a year in bed once in th grade and another time as a late teenager and nobody noticed i cried for a whole days one time the tears just kept pouring outnobody noticed i had panic attacks without knowing they were panic attacks i got into weed and alcohol not knowing how much it all could exacerbate things im in legal trouble because things escalated for me i had just been diagnosed and i was already on medication im scared alone and just trying to get by howd i get this far i always felt like i had so much potential and i truly wanted to do things and live genuinely i feel like a failure i just never knew things could get this bad,2
its a lot to handle sometimes so i looked up the statistic and feel less alone,2
after multiple years of suffering from different combinations of bipolar bpd narcissism adhd symptoms and ocd symptoms i am symptomfree i still have anxiety attacks sometimes but like once a week if that and certain phobias and have to control my ocd symptoms with some rigid scheduling but my depression splitting hyper fixations and attention issues are effectively gone and im so fucking bored none of the things that made me feel good do that anymore but i dont feel bad because it all came from avoidance im used to fighting depression of the time and without that im listless so what do you do with this does anyone have any advice dbt and ifs suggestions especially appreciated,2
im doing all the shit they tell you to do ask for help early intervene use skills tell your care team what is going onetc the past few weeks have felt like shit but ive managed to avoid a major incident i still had to take an incomplete in my coursework and will have to finish the module over the summer but i am not set back by a whole year like last time so i guess you could say that things are working but i feel like im not being taken seriously by my providers i am telling them what is going on and how i am feeling but since i didnt have a major incident that ended in disaster i feel like they are telling me that im fine and not really listening i feel like the only time people listen to what im saying is when im literally having a medical emergency it is really invalidating and makes me feel like my problems are only valid if theyre immediately life threatening anyone else how do you keep taking care of yourself when everyone sees you as managing but youre actually barely scraping by,2

i started a depressed episode in oct of this did not start right away but rather crept in especially in the last or so months ive been doing much better but this is still lingering i feel as though its getting better but im not sure and just here to see if other experience this and if there are things to help when i look in the mirror i do not recognize myself i dont even know what i think i look like in my head its really hard for me to picture my face but when i see myself i think this is not what i look like even tho it obviously is this also happens when i look at photos of myself its a bit bothersome and makes it hard to feel confident about the way i look bc i used to be so confident but now i dont even know what i look like or am supposed to look like if that makes sense,2
im aware this sounds like psychosis i have an appointment set up it isnt until next week im making this post wondering if anyone else experiences something like this when my meds stop working or im in a depressive episi have a voice in my head that is me but shes mean and hateful only towards me for example i go to do the pile of dishes at the sink ive promised to wash for days and she starts telling me that my husband hates me and i should just give up and kms its just a constant badgering and peanut gallery horseshit i know im going to sound crazier saying this but i tell her to shut up and sometimes it works im sorry if this doesnt make a lick of sense,2
so ive been cycling since beginning of december before it was switching back and forth around every days with about hours of euthymia between the upgtdown switch and none in the downgtup switch but since some time in early feb its more like switching every hours usually but sometimes a cycle gets a bonus half day added to it and this is with little or no break in between sides now this is where my question comes in i started on latuda in early feb which seemed to work for like days a week in then stop then feb i got upped to as well as wellbutrin being doubled from oo now since last week almost exactly weeks after upping the two the pattern has started doing something extra weird now instead of just going updownupdown like it was before theres a day break between the solid up and down and its not euthymia its like a funky mixed thing going on where it rapidly switches back and forth between lighter versions of both sides with each side ranging anywhere from a couple minutes to an hour then it switches into a full state for a day to continue the cycle usually it goes in order but it doesnt always so my question is i really cant understand exactly what this means does this mean its getting better or worse im trying to figure out if maybe the med changes are in the right direction or if this is actually worsening in some ways id say better since the number of full cycles is technically slowed a little but for more obvious reasons it may be worse also these bouncy days are pretty obnoxious when it comes to doing things like work because i cant actually maintain a flow since it keeps changing on me has anyone had any sorta situation like this before do you think this is a path toward better or is it actually getting worse i would think a question like that would be obvious but it isnt for this oo,2
im posting here because im technically diagnosed as bipolar and i suspect it could potentially be related in the form of overthinking overall ive had pretty stable mental health since i graduated college and started working college was hell and now i occasionally get hypomanic but nothing extreme even less frequently do i ever feel depressed all without meds has bad side effects didnt really help felt like it kept me in a sick mindset but i digress so i think im doing great overall i feel privileged in that way but something i still struggle with is this feeling of existential dread i get when i mistake a mistake am wrong or am just being trolled i have many examples but one today was someone on an academic subreddit telling me im wrong about something and implied im an idiot that doesnt know what im talking about all when this person couldnt refute what i was saying and was generally being a dck focused on me being wrong instead of trying to discuss as a community others have been related to feeling secluded in my field of work because i research a type of illness our product exacerbates to find preventative measures so sometimes i have to trigger people and if i try to find colleagues to talk to it could harm the business which my boss is annoyed about not violating any ndas but i digress basically anytime i get shut down by someone one way or another i have thoughts of just not wanting to continue on just being unable to cope with other people i dont perceive them as being sicidal like i wouldnt act on it or plan or anything but just a feeling of anxiety and fear from making social mistakes like fearing being canceled for a misunderstanding i just feel like i dont know how to move on then i think my hypomania kicks that overthinking into overdrive all until i sleep and wake up the next day usually but not always sometimes it does lead to dysthymia or depression ive never really had a lot of friends im married in a great relationship with great international inlaws but i dont have regular friends i hang out with mostly friendships of convenience like classmates nor do i have a good family i guess i generally feel like i dont really have people to support me despite being able to get by in most social situations fine i dont have a real social life and always feel lacking or like i know how to talk to people in personal like i only have enough social skills to survive and pass as normal but maybe awkward sometimes but the awkwardness and not knowing what to do in social situations is what sara me up,2
she said it is half moon and half sun and it reminded her of me it think shes onto me,2
ill preface this post with the fact that i have bipolar and im young i know both those things contribute to the impulse of money spending i am still in college and my parents give me money for necessities groceries therapy gas money to visit home i did have a regular job but i quit because of how toxic the workplace was i babysit pretty regularly and i am in the running for a job as a ghost tour guide so its not like i cant afford frivolous things but i do feel bad about not having basically any money in my savings to my name right now its insane i am no longer someone who buys clothes just because i like them but i did go up a few sizes due to medication increase and diet change so ive been having to replace a lot of my old clothes i always shop at goodwill though and lately i havent had to buy that much i dont buy house decor anymore since i am definitely fulfilled in that aspect i only buy art supplies when my current ones are totally out of use i think i impulse buy fast food or even restaurant food super easily when i can just cook it or use my meal plan at school i only have to pay kk per year at school due to scholarships and financial aid but its still a big chunk my parents now pay half ever since i quit my job my biggest vice however is legos i buy so many legos especially when im feeling anxious theyre a super efficient distraction and a really engaging hobby even my parents support it because they see how it calms me and makes me happy but my issue is that whenever i get any sort of significant money i immediately go to buy legos i dont know how to stop or budget or anything or put any of it into a savings account without just taking it right back out its like every other week at this point i need help how do you all save money you all know what i do and dont spend it on so do you have any tips,2
i had a manic episode about months ago that has completely derailed my life i quit my dream job burned professional bridges too left my home and my roomate to find another place to live quickly moved to a city where i knew no one left personal belongings behind racked up k in credit card debt i met someone i shouldnt have trusted and helped him buy a car luckily i was able to sell it but i also bought myself a new car i didnt need i am now k underwater in a car loan and had to move back in with my parents i am close to years old my professional career is destroyed and i lost most of my friendships the ones i still have now keep me at a distance due to my behaviors everyone says that they didnt recognize me at all during this time and i am ashamed i am unemployed in debt and unable to function normally i have memories surface of the episode still and it sends me into the deepest despair i feel like there is no point in living anymore i dont know how to exist in this new reality of my life anyone who can relate or is my situation just extremely crazy,2
i detest how no one understands that im not okay even when im not depressed my hypomanic episodes always start lightly actually eating properly cleaning the entire house talking to people etc and people will congratulate me you finally got upcleaned the mess you live in and are all happy that im somehow fine and cured now then it gets worse and ill start to get angry easily hit stuff yell at people over the smallest things get drunk or high with anything close by ill do illegal shit steal stuff or try to harm myself either by relapsing staying awake until passing out or straight up attempting suicide because why not and everyone blames me for it in their eyes i am choosing to destroy the supposed progress from my depressive episodes why would you do that to yourself and i thought you were doing better no im fucking not its dumb i know it shouldnt make me so angry but i hate that no one around me is capable of grasping the fact that ill always be sick that its not something that will just leave i can never be happy or proud over the small accomplishments during depressive episodes because any of it could mean i am heading towards hypomania its so tiring,2
the up the down the middle never really feeling normal exhausted because of medication scared im scary hiding who i am because im such a mess and being misinterpreted as a weirdo maybe i am a weirdo i dont know i feel so fuckinglonely i can have so much energy have a bad thought and boom im down for the count i cant stand the mess my house is i cant stand how hard it is for me to shower sometimes or focus on one thing rather than things at once i just need a break from my god damn brain,2

im just very lost right now a few weeks ago my physical health took a major dive and ive been in and out of hospitals since along with my physical health went my mental health and im really not doing well right now being depressed while also having to make doctors appointments and explaining my situation over and over again is not ideal to say the least not to mention i cant work right now and im probably going to have to quit my job which i love soon i just dont know how to live like this it feels like this is all thats left for me and i dont know how to push through it anymore,2
preface im diagnosed for years but deemed stable enough so no treatment outside meds so i dont have someone else to ask this question to i have been lazy on my medication lately big mistake but is anyone else really bored while sleeping while hypomanic like waking up is a relief i only sleep for a few hours because of this just wondering if theres anyone else if its a symptom or if im just weird,2

i think ive only been able to identify episode of hypomania so far and that was months ago because it was prominent after a long period of a depressive episode some days i randomly feel really good and energetic mixed with irritability but i cant really tell if im hypomanic or not,2

what coping mechanisms have you come up with to help you deal with bipolar ive realized that doing the following things helps me minimizing my alcohol intake even two beers can send me into a depressive episode finding a form of movement that i enjoy doing for me its stretching yoga and dancing human interaction i cant always stand it especially when im in a depressive episode but i try to force myself to spend time with friends who i know will be good company taking my meds around the same time every day,2
i take mg lurasidone and have been taking it for over a year i just started taking mg of lamotrigine and i was told it could cause my birth control to be ineffective and vice versa that the lamotrigine could be less effective bc of the birth control do you take lamotrigine and have you found a birth control that is effective together or did you have to stop taking it im on the pill norethindrome if that helps but i am open to the idea of trying other contraceptives,2
im a young girl in her th year of medical school that was diagnosed months ago and i feel like this disease its almost ending with my dreams ive been having panic attacks and a lot of depression lately and some pairs of mine are bullying me now they treat me like there is something wrong with me im paralyzed i dont know what to do i take all my medicines go to the therapist and all of those things but this is getting over me im so tired of this,2

so i enjoy drinking but problem is lately i have less tolerance and get easily drunk i dont remember anything i have memory loss plus when im super drunk i flirt a lot amd would kiss anyone like last night but really i dont remember anything maybe i became drunk faster because i took h before mg of lithium and also because i drunk too fast problem is when i sober i feel disgusted to myself and full of guilt i feel so shameless and i just regret everything,2

hey guys blood transfusions are in an alltime low globally so please consider donating blood since there are no international regulations on the criteria for donating wouldnt it be great if everyone here would tell their experience with it and if they are allowed so i will start i live in germany take lamictal lamotrigin and was allowed to donate normally as long as the medication is relatively stable normally how was it with you,2

im not getting the help i need but i dont really have anyone to reach out to my siblings are happy healthy people who id rather not bother my father is an alcoholic who cant take care of me anymore i often think maybe its time to throw in the towel i cant even get my meds without help so is it even worth continuing all these emotions and a body that barely works im alright im not suicidal currently i just dont care anymore maybe i just lay in bed and wait for eternity without anyone to rely on this just feels so unbearable,2
i recently had a bad manic episode which very quickly descended into bad psychosis im thankfully coming out of it now and am under the care of the crisis team and getting daily home visits however what im really struggling with is processing whats happened to me i have all these memories of the delusions i was having and how strongly i believed in them and while i know now that they werent real mostly i still have flashes of confusion im feeling really rocked by whats happened i cant get over how quickly i lost my grip on reality and how dangerous it was i know its normal to feel depressed after something like this but i guess all im looking for is reassurance that im not alone with this and that other people have gone through psychosis and come out the other side any anecdotes or words of wisdom would be greatly appreciated particularly around what recovery was like and how long it took thank you,2
i have been thinking a lot about this today and i just want to share some thoughts with you guys it has been years since i was diagnosed with bipolar disorder that i live with this is no surprise to anybody who knows me this disease is so much more nuanced than the typical extreme ups and downs description it usually receives i have survived two absolutely devastating depressions and approximately twenty manic episodes attempting to describe what mania is like is the worst frustration it happens gradually and then comes upon me like a brick to the face first i stop sleeping then the creativity comes the blank page beckons to me the way freshly baked bread might entice the starving it is soft at first subtle even but the persistent pentopage prevails and soon i am unable to make sense of or even put into context the hasty and paranoid puzzle of words grandiosity accompanies the writing then the delusions come and i believe that this puzzle of words is worthy of a pulitzer other things happen too reckless driving substance use rage impulsivity irrationality ultimately i surrender to complete psychosis saying it is a lot is an understatement i have destroyed and lost relationships with family members and friends because of this illness i have said and done unforgivable things but it is my deepest wish that people understand that becoming manic is not a choice it has happened to me whilst on medication and off alike i would never choose it im simply reflecting on all of this today because earlier i read this bipolar disorder results in years reduction in expected life span and as many as one in five patients with bipolar disorder completes suicide national institute of mental health thats the reality its my reality i do not want to ever become a statistic and i want to live as full a life as possible here is what im grateful for i have an incredible support network i have doctors and therapy i have the most loving and supportive family and friends ones who are able to look beyond my illness and recognize that i am not me in those manic moments and i am grateful for the ability to empathize with all those who struggle we can do together what we could never do alone,2
how would you react would be angry eleven years of med cocktails that never seemed to get it right you eventually just give up feeling and take your mg of olanzapine every morning because it this point youd be much sicker from the withdrawal than on the meds themselves over a dozen sessions of ect no matter what memories stayed or are lost to time youll never forget the first of numerous times you were told that you were going to have this illness they handed to you for the rest of your life thank you for reading writing this was a good vent,2
i enby have been told i show signs of bipolar by multiple professionals they cant diagnose me since im young though this made me analyze my behaviors and realize when i was manic movies and shows make mania seem fun it makes it seem like a drug it can be fun it can be euphoric but its usually so unbelievably painful its excoriating when i told my friends i was probably bipolar they didnt really bat an eye they saw me being reckless and doing risky things and they thought it was fun mania is so much anger its such a deep anger i cant explain it and ive realized thats a symptom and not everyone feels it its such a trip all the things i thought were normal were probably symptoms my friends thought mania was fun they saw movies of people going out and doing drugs they saw me going out and doing drugs but when i explained what its like they were terrified and they should be this isnt fun bipolar isnt fun mania needs to stop being romanticized your perception of reality shifts youre angry and even more angry that no one can help you you do reckless things because you just dont care youre filled with so much self hatred and if the consequence isnt immediate death than it doesnt matter its not fun i cant explain how un fun it is its so unstable you cant control your emotions its constantly changing it reminds me of vampire diaries when theyre in transition their emotions are magnified it can be fun but theyre usually a mess hurting themselves being destructive drinking hating themselves im not sure why i made this post i feel cheated kind of everyone makes mania seem so fun and crazy and like a movie but its scary,2
for a few months ive been having more paranoid moments and they were followed by the feeling of seeing something moving in the corner of my eye sometimes i would see sudden movement on the very verge of my vision and it would freak me out but after that i would always check the thing and it would be a charger slipping off the bed and such the dark flashes not the actual real moving stuff would always leave me disturbed but i always just freezed in shock and then i was able to rationalise it and calm down however this week i was laying in bed with my partner and when i turned my face to the wall in the shadow i saw a dark moving shape like an animal or a black blob of darkness crawling into the bed my body immediately started screaming to the point of throat hurting afterwards i was extremely terrified and scared about our safety for the first time i was actually staring at something shadowy moving it wasnt just a sharp movement in the corner of my eye but something i could look at and it would still be looking absolutely scary are experiences like this hallucinations before i thought it was just paranoia oh im scared that someone would break into my flat so im seeing more movements because im scared but that was different do you also experience this,2
i am and have a year old i have found that my mania and hypomania is significantly different at this point in my life than when i was in my late teens and early s back then i gravitated towards dangerous and hypersexual things while manic nowadays i dont even have the same thoughts cross my mind i feel hypomanic for sure right now and i find myself filling my calendar with volunteer opportunities and weekend events to take the kids im a step mom too to and honestly im super grateful i used to do the craziest stuff and it was dangerous and unwise now i certainly am aware that im putting a lot on my plate right now but its all good stuff im trying to lose weight quit smoking and find activities to be closer to the community and my kids i feel like the change is both with aging and also becoming a mother really calmed me down overall,2
do you guysgals tell people youre dating that youre bipolar if so how early into the relationship i imagine telling someone on the first or second date wouldnt go over too well but i also wouldnt want to feel like im deceiving anyone just curious what other people think and their experiences,2
anybody experience waking through the night to a panic attack it happened to me twice last night i can count on one hand the total number of panic attacks ive had in my life not real sure what that was about anxiety has been a problem for me but not so much with the fullblown panic just curious of others who experience them do they tend to happen in clusters do you get them during the daytime too,2
i started taking latuda about months ago and everythings been really great until now its helped incredibly and i have had very very little side effects i do want to say my anxiety has been higher recently too a couple months ago i started losing my appetite to where id only get hungry in the late afternoon or evening about a week and a half ago it stopped all together and im struggling to eat now when i try to eat i feel so disgusted by food ill start gagging and have to spit out the food or else ill throw up ive been living off ensure drinks and trying so hard to make myself eat in between i messaged my psychiatrist about everything thats been going on and she said to see the doctor to rule out the flu i went dont have the flu they did every blood test imaginable everything came back great i did a covid test and that was negative after telling my psych the updates she thinks its that im not absorbing latuda effectively with my gi symptoms i dont think i fully understand what she means she also suggested that i switch to zyprexa olanzapine instead of the latuda i messaged my therapist today hoping for something else i guess and all she asked was if i started the zyprexa not eating is making me feel so weak and dizzy and i feel so sick all the time i want to just eat normally again so bad im just wondering if anyone else ever experienced anything like this with latuda,2

hey all i was recently diagnosed bipolar but am sitting in the tattered remains of my life wondering how i could have believed what i did i first felt symptoms of mania and intense narcissism this summer im yrs old i had recently gone through a breakup with my partner of years had fallen in love with my female best friend first queer experience and she did not reciprocate my feelings and my workload had become incredibly overwhelming i started losing weight and hair had a stress rash on my body and was experiencing fluctuating feelings between paranoia to believing the universe was speaking to me directly but theres a delusion i am struggling with the most that has left me feeling horrid and unforgivable i believed my wonderful boss of years had emotionally abused me and was the reason i was experiencing mania and psychosis i believed this so hard i convinced myself and my therapistpsychiatrist i had ptsd and that my boss and workplace were all to blame i told so many people this was what happened to me because i truly believed it i blocked my boss on everything and didnt talk to her for months this january i finally looked back at the texts that i thought proved i was abused and found nothing but support and concern from a woman who never did anything but treat me with respect how the hell does this happen has anyone ever experienced anything similar honestly ive been feeling suicidal since the realization i got fired from my job for other mistakes i made while manic but i dont know how to tell i everyone i talked to that what i believed for the last months was a total lie please help,2
hi this post could be triggering to others with imposter syndrome so i want to start off by saying that these are my own anxieties my goal here is to know if anyone else has felt this way and if theyve been able to circumvent it i was officially diagnosed with bp by my psychiatrist in the fall but had previously been diagnosed with a general mood disorder and major depressive disorder and a suggestion of cyclothymia from a therapist bipolar makes sense to me it tracks with situations and periods of my life where i was feeling unnaturally confident and fun in a dangerous way and more often the periods where ive been unable to get out of bed or the house for weeks still i have this weird fear of learning more about bipolar disorder because theres a part of me that fears that if i read about it indepth i might start mirroring symptoms that i dont usually experience sometimes this includes even browsing or participating in this sub and rbipolar i think being medicated with varied success also plays into that but i also think thats just a common bipolar experience you find good meds and then you wonder if youre even bipolar i feel that way when they work but i keep on taking them and then i will have breakthrough depression after years of being more stable on meds and i wonder if its a sign that i have something else wrong with me so to those that have survived imposter syndrome how is there a way to not be afraid to learn about your own medically diagnosed disorder or to just accept that i have this disorder without constantly questioning myself,2
i recently found out that im bipolar and ive suffered from it for a long time i tend to procrastinate too much but sometimes i get focused on things that arent so useful i really want to go to university but im afraid i wont keep it until the end from being depressed lying in bed or hypomanic focused on other matters does anyone have any tips to help me,2
hi i hope this is allowed here wasnt sure if i should post it here or somewhere else its kinda really hard to post this so i have bipolar mania i havent received treatment for it in years i would love to eventually get treatment i also am pretty sure i have an incurable std not asking for any diagnoses or anything is it okay to ask if anybody else does too i have this very strong feeling im not good enough to have friends or relationships because of all these things ie to keep people safe away from meno one wants to be around someone like that probably this makes it easier when im having a depressive episode to push everyone away without thinking im doing so i feel like just the thought makes my depressive episodes worse does anybody else feel this way how do they get through feeling this way im constantly trying to convince myself that i still deserve to have a good happy life and people that love me would you be friends with someone if you knew that they had an incurable disease,2
is suicidal ideation recognised as a symptom of bipolar or as a consequence of bipolar i tend to rationalize it as a symptom and that helps to create separation between brain and person what do you guys think im coming onto lithium feeling alot of emotions atm love you all x,2
i am finally stabile after half a year of searching for the right drug and dosage however what happens is that i feel that i do not function well verbally i am too apathetic asocial and in some situations it happens that i do not understand what people want to say to me or that i cannot express my thoughts not always but sometimes before the onset of the disorder i was witty more open to people i expressed myself very well verbally and some people considered me smart because of that trait now i feel that i am losing that quality and the question is how to solve these difficulties what are your experiences with dialectical cognitive therapy,2
ive had bp what appears to be my whole life and saw all the chaos as just part of who i was and that was okay now that ive been working towards getting stable ive looked back and realised just how bad ive been and how bad ive hurt people including myself ive let go of the guilt now and im happy that ive committed to getting better for the future but part of me feels sad with my brain feeling so quiet i feel empty and boring and like what made me me is now gone so im having to relearn this healthier version of myself it feels so scary for some reason i also feel like i cant explain that to anyone who doesnt have what we have partly brcause i dont want to as i feel like i should be happy that im doing so well and finally feel at peace i hope this makes sense and i also hope that im not the only one thats going throughhas gone through this if you have how can you make this easier i definitely wont give up on my medstherapy for the sake of the people i love and my future but it does feel so tempting to stop and go back to what feels familiar,2
i was diagnosed with bd years ago and received my bpd diagnosis yesterday from what i get from the internet the major difference is that bpd alone does not experience mania hence the bd diagnosis has anyone else in this sub been diagnosed with both how would you describe it hows life,2
for me it feels like an entire lifetimes worth of depression low self worth is compressing itself into a few hoursdays i cant stop crying i cant laugh i cant smile or anything i feel nothing and everything all at once x,2

sometimes the smallest things set me off a change in tone the smallest little hurtful thing makes me feel absolutely crazy triggered a depressive ep or destructive ep and its getting progressively harder to manage anyone else,2
i saw my psychologist this monday after going what felt like through a tornado of emotions of the weekend i was so happy one minuet and then crying the next and getting upset and then excited i told her about how usually this lasts for a few weeks and then i cant get out of bed only to walk my dogs or do the bare minimum she said that i had bipolar and my whole world stoppedlike i just thought i was always just an intense person who felt a lotive never felt like i was superhuman or had the sort of manic episodes ive seen on tvim just really surprised,2
was discussing music on another post it makes me wonder which songs do you listen to when youre in the depths of this illness or experiencing the highs i always love music suggestions ive found the best artists this way share with me lol one song i sing loudly in the shower is x by bring me the horizon the lyrics remind me so much of what i go through,2
mania is exciting when it comes i embrace it but am i refusing to let it go because i feel in control but am i really or is this just a delusional sense of stability will we ever really know if we can trust all of our emotions and comprehension baffled by life constantly,2
i went through a hypomanic mixed episode for the past two and a half weeks that came to a head on wednesday resulting in si im no longer experiencing the si and had a med change but was asked if id be open to a php today i received the intake phone call and they want me to start next wednesday if my existence within the bipolar lens is continuously cycling and from stable to unstableif im no longer experiencing the si do i still participate in the php i dont currently have any providers other than my psychiatrist which is definitely an issue im also worried about taking the time off work because i have a big project due soon and my colleague is out all in all its only days so do i do the one thing i have been putting off for years because of school and career or do i put myself first and participate is it worth the time effort and disappointment of my boss knowing that im going to cycle for the rest of my life,2
i was just diagnosed as bipolar a few months ago even though for the last years ive been telling them that i thought i was i have manic episodes but they only last a couple days then i go straight back into depression when i am depressed i completely withdraw from society and go into my shell i wont answer the phone or texts and i avoid doing any tasks because of a complete lack of motivation and some sort of fear about dealing with things that might be unpleasant im on short term disability from work for this and an autoimmune disease and i need to turn in papers by march rd from my doctor ir else they will not approve my claim ive been laying here in bed for days not bathing and in this cycle of not doing the paperwork but then feeling guilty about it and its fucking miserable i know that avoiding the paperwork is only causing me to make the anxiety and problem worse but even the thought of likely losing my job isnt enough to overcome the lack of motivation im about to call my doctor and ask about a change of med dosage i guess i just wanted to vent to someone that might understand what im going through,2
ive been using goodrx for some time now and im so glad i found it some of my meds cost hundreds of dollars with an insurance discount of but under with goodrx back when i took seroquel the outofpocket rate was about with insurance and with goodrx medication costs have absolutely gone through the roof even with employer plans but for meds that offer generic the cost is ridiculously less expensive with the app moms oncologist prescribed her an antinausea medication and i texted him to ask if there was a less expensive option considering cvs wanted to charge me for a months supply he was livid he said cvs had been charging the oldbrand name price for the generic for not only that med but several others that his patients had informed him of he advised me to download the goodrx app and i paid just sharing as an fyi as im on multiple meds that i used to pay way more than i should have been previously all mine are under and only one is over id be paying close to month otherwise,2
when i first started using cannabis it was clear it didnt jive with my mental health disorder once i got stabilized i reintroduced cannabis and its been a really great thing for my routine i know that of bipolar people have issues with it but i really like it its fantastic for me but i feel guilty for using it with bipolar people act like if you use cannabis while bipolar youre going to act like youre on pcp or some crazy shit should i be feeling guilty because i use cannabis medically is there some extreme danger i dont know about im so much higher functioning now i can socialize again and finish projects and not sleep hrs from depression its definitely not right for everyone but its helping me so much anyone else have this experience,2
i feel so lost in the world and ive been cutting off a lot of friends feeling mentally and physically exhausted not eating as much crying and relapsing way more it sucks feeling this way and my mother keeps yelling at me about my college grades even though im trying my hardest both my parents and other family members keep telling me im not doing enough or im not even trying and it makes me feel so sad because i dont even feel like my old smart self anymore i just feel like a shell of someone who used to have dreams and actually even smile i just want to be happy but every day seems to be piling and piling up and so are suicidal thoughts every day more and more thoughts flood my mind and its been getting unbearable in a way i am not certain if i would ever act on them i want to say that i wouldnt but i can fully say that and i feel invisible nobody at school cares if i show up my family and relatives treat me like an alien my crush has been dry with me and i feel like i could run out in the street and just scream and nobody would even bat an eye i just feel so tired and lonely,2
i believe im in my first true mixed episode and i have to say i think i rather just be depressed or manic being both at the same time is driving me insane one day im signing myself up to go out and be social and the next im wondering why i ever thought that was a good idea in the first place i hate it suicidal this hour and then normal a couple hours later i just had to rant because it feels like i have different people inside my head and im not sure which one im waking up with each morning anyone relate im on vraylar currently and just started buspar for anxiety,2
as a teen who got diagnosed with bipolar on the first year of high school i found that theres a huge negative stigma surrounding bipolar between some of my friend groups and my school as well so i just want advice on things what are some common misconceptionsthings that you find annoying when people say it and what can i do to address it,2
so im in a depressive episode today its bad i have nowhere to be so this was a good time for it however im trying to reach out to people to work through it and no one is responding my delusion rn is that they all arent responding on purpose and they want me to die i dont know what to do its just me and my dog rn and i cant find my headphones so i cant take him on a walk without worrying about things getting worse because im alone with my thoughts,2
i have thingspeople in my life that i am grateful for but im deeply unhappy i have goals but they seem unattainable i know what i have to do to feel more satisfied more fulfilled but it really seems like an uphill battle i need to lose a lot of weight that i gained because of meds and overeating due to stress trauma and fucked up hunger cues from the meds i need to get a better paying job so i can afford to live on my own and not live paycheck to paycheck or work a part time in addition to my full time then i have my grander goals like grad school getting married and starting a family moving up in my career im just so deeply unhappy with where i currently am and how hard i have to work on top of managing my mood swings so much so that i frequently contemplate just giving up on being alive at all i had to put my dog to rest this week and the week leading up to it and this week ive pretty much let my routine go i dont shower frequently enough i dont do my skincare i dont eat well but im still not losing weight i barely manage min of exercise which my partner so helpfully points out is not enough if im serious about losing weight and every meal i skip my mother cheers me on because i have fat to sustain me anyway i feel close to a breakdown i want to give up so badly im what high functioning looks like miserable and barely holding on,2
after long three weeks of depression and a total sudden mood elevation thats been going on for a week now my psychotherapist and my psychiatrist and actually most of my loved ones who arent healthcare workers even all think that i have bipolar type my psychotherapist sent me links to educate myself on the topic and now i feel completely understood i feel like now much much much of my crises actually make sense now i thought it was just normal in mdd to have sudden peaks of good mood uninhibition hypersexuality agitation euphoria insomnia energy you name it i thought it was normal for people with it but now as im reading about bipolar everything make sense now im so happy to probably have found one of my diagnoses but it is also a lot to unpack and ill be needing to so some work with myself to stop gaslighting my own thoughts and understand that its all okay ive posted about whats going on with my mental health in social media and actually found out that a lot of my friends and colleagues are bipolar as well and they understand me so much at first i was sad because i thought there was no one i could talk to that would understand what i was going through but speaking whats on your mind can actually help you even reconnect as i did with old friendships i feel a lot more in peace now and i dont even got a diagnosis yet but i understand now that what happens with me is common and im not alone today is my rd day with the change of my meds from a mdd treatment to a bipolar one still quite hypomanic but im positive that everythings gonna be alright in the end,2

i just cant get it out of my head that im not but this past january i thought i was an aztec chased by jaguars and loved the feeling of fighting for my life it was exhilarating thought the starbucks mermaid lady was laughing at me and that walls were moving also heard some voices walked through puddles in the rain and got my clothes and shoes sopping wet because i thought id be reincarnated as a mentally healthy person saw cameras where there were none thought people on the bus were plotting to kill me thought an escalator was gonna eat me kept dissociating pretended to eat my fingers like they were chicken tenders looked in the mirror and thought my mouth was full with my fingers and laughed at myself then i was horrified in my head was thinking i must grab the skin and scooped it out and realized i was picking at my face and stopped myself overall i was unstable for around weeks was incredibly depressed for around a month afterwards but i was able to reality check i was very agitated but i worked okay and hid the symptoms successfully and let myself enter the other world when i was alone i dont remember how sleep went but it wasnt bad i took myself to the hospital when i almost walked into traffic bc i was dissociating badly and terrified by the mix of suicidalselfdestructive thoughts and intense glee but i was diagnosed with bipolar and then later at a php another psychiatrist confirmed the diagnosis and these past four days ive had unbearable amounts of energy rock climbed for hours disappeared in music to the point that i forgot i was listening to music and the noises scared me everything feels so good it feels good on my fingers to type this i can feel the energy of cars passing by i can feel the patterns of tree branches also irritated with other people at points they talk too slow have had trouble sleeping and feel fine felt connected to the universe felt funny in my head im on lithium so im self aware and i dont get as many bizarre thoughts as i did the first time around but i dont get the urge to buy things on this subreddit people say they buy things but i dont do that and now im beginning to feel a bit of sleepiness and mania has to last seven days to be mania doesnt it i feel like im faking it i see some symptoms align with bp but im thinking of stopping my medication and then ill see if this is truly maniahypomania i just dont know how do you know youre not faking it,2
i am doing so bad i am so suicidal depressed and just feel terrible all around ive been doing so many things that are bad for me lately like sh skipping meds and drinking when i have an illness that is triggered by alcohol im probably about to end up in a mental hospital again and school is just too much for me to deal with on top of everything else i am constantly so stressed out about my school work and grades and it is making my mental health so much worse all i want to do is drop out i just cant do it anymore life feels like way too much i wish i was dead,2
i feel like im going insane nobody wants to see me or listen to me i feel like crying myself to sleep i dont have any intention to harm or hurt myself but i just feel lonely maybe im crazy maybe dont know but i told my friend i wanted to hang out today and he said he was busy with homework which is understandable i guess but why do i feel like hes going to avoid me forever ive had so many people leave my life because of this stupid bipolar disorder they think im insane im just mad at myself i feel like this is going to be read as calm down youre overreacting but i feel like breaking down today was supposed to be good i ate with my mom at a restaurant together but now i feel horrible,2
sometimes i feel like its a merry go round ive been on so many that ive lost count off the top of my head lithium ambien trazadone risperdal depakote temazepam seroquel perphenazine zoloft abilify wellbutrin currently on latuda im sure theres others but just dont remember them ive had side effects from the majority of them lithium destroyed my thyroid and caused me to gain weight rapidly risperdal made me incredibly stiff in the mornings where it was hard to get out of bed zoloft made me yawn for zero reason constantly seroquel made me aggressive and hard to wake up so far latuda has been pretty good no side effects that i can think of other than the gagging when i saw the retail price,2
imagine my surprise when i go into my psych appointment expecting to get diagnosed with adhd and getting diagnosed with bipolar instead i was prescribed vraylar and im honestly terrified of taking it ive read the side effects and damn it makes me so anxious and sad and mad that i was even diagnosed i honestly dont even know if my diagnosis is right i dont really experience mania as ive seen other people describe it idk im feeling pretty down and dont know what to do im considering not even taking my meds but ive heard that you should absolutely take your meds if you have bd idk anything might help,2
my hallucinations are far and few when they happen it scares the shit out of me how many of you experience them mine are mainly auditory if im in a paranoid state i see figures in the corner of my eye but as soon as i turn no one is there ive had one physical one a few years ago i was driving and i felt someone grip my left shoulder the only one in the car was my sleeping toddler strapped in his carseat tonight i thought i saw a blanket on my couch move and i heard specifically clear as day my fb messenger ding four times checked them nothing no spam no requests no calls im petrified of this getting worse they only seem to flare up when im under intense stress,2
hi everyone i have been seeing the same therapist for almost two months now while i think we are working well together i am getting the feeling that i am repeating myself every session i just cant help but overthink my whole life this tends to obsessively question my career constant negative self talk and occasional suicidal ideation although i could never take action so its mostly more self torture im eating maybe to meals a day inconsistently showering never doing laundry and so lethargic that i mostly just lay down and watch tvyoutube whenever i get home from work i dont take walks i dont try to think positively i dont really exercise i dont practice gratefulness etc etc i feel like a loser but the thing isi dont make any effort to change or feel better my therapist keeps clearly telling me this rumination is simply not beneficial i know this is true but it feels impossible to stop i cant feel better without taking action again total agreement with my therapist but taking action is so hard its getting to the point where i am thinking i am comfy in my misery i no longer have hypomanic phases thanks to medication but at least when i was hypomanic i was putting in effort to better myself this nonstop depression is so consistent i am beginning to hypothesize that its not really depression but me continuously self sabotaging myself and always blaming it on something external can anyone relate would you say this is just more negative rumination or overthinking if not how does one shake the refusal to take action for their own sake,2
m february i finalized my divorce i had been trapped in a dysfunctional marriage for years during those years i was incredibly stable but incredibly over medicated towards the end when things were at their worst i was alone self medicating with alcohol during those years i was on venlafaxine seroquel and lamotragine in february with a fresh start to life i started exercising and eating better i stayed away from my phone and computer and i would go out and socialize i started looking better and feeling better knowing the side effects of the meds i started tweaking the dosages seroquel in particular is incredibly sedating so i thought i could go down a natural route managing my bipolar with healthy stress management i saw improvements i had more energy my rest was better i kept lowering the dosages and kept seeing improvements with my mood and energy i was aware of the risk of mania so i was very acute in getting enough sleep and if i needed to i would use seroquel more as a prn fast forward to june and this slope lead me to a path where i was completely off all medication i was making strides in all areas of my life in particular my relationship with my daughter we were having a blast and an incredible start to the summer with my motivation and optimism for life all while this was happening i was keeping watch on my mania never denying that it could pop up at some point it would be about when july hit that the first occurrences of mania became apparent in retrospect but wasnt obvious or out of control at the time it was the beginnings of losing touch with reality passing interactions with other people i would sometimes get a hint that i had a larger purpose but they were fleeting and rare so i didnt take notice by the end of july i was semiregularly battling against these thoughts that the strangers i would come across would be part of a conspiracy and that there was some purpose behind their being there i was in conflict with myself of me didnt believe it and thought it was ridiculous thought that it was my duty to be humble with getting recognition and attention and was feeding into the delusion by the end of august i was getting exhausted with the notion of being at the center of everything i hated the idea that i had to be studied admired and protected i knew that something was happening on the outside world and i didnt know if i was seen as a reconciler of religion science and all cultures i was seen as the person to bring the whole world together and the inspiration of a movement that could potentially solve any problem it was seen as the opportunity for aliens to finally make their presence known by the end of september i knew there were reasons that the movement couldnt directly come to light to me and i being in a sort of partnership with the movement i started giving my personal belongings away i would donate my clothes my coin collection my golf clubs my old baseball glove and most of my other stuff it was my belief that each item would go to a person in need and every item would be cherished by someone i sort of expected to get something in return but never did of course or if i did i stole it thinking i was meant to steal it i was also writing and doing art at this point which i was also leaving behind on purpose in public places when october rolled around i quit my job because when the world was following me i saw my job as a way for me to feel normal for a while i didnt want to give up my old life but i had a higher calling it would have been around october th when i was completely exhausted from all of this i couldnt handle the pressure i couldnt handle the fact that most of me still didnt believe this shit but that brainwashingpropagandapartofthebrain that kept feeding me these thoughts i was exhausted fighting that all those months i had the idea to go find some weed i never smoked it before in my life so i went to a vape store and asked if they had anything that could get me high they gave me a canister and a battery i didnt look at it or do any research because with everything being planted and all information to my phone being filtered there was no point i went home and smoked it i went into a panic immediately thinking i was going to die i called an ambulance they came but they didnt seem too concerned when they got here i was getting frustrated because they werent taking this emergency seriously i was out of my mind psychotic i fell to the floor devolving from a human to a werewolf to smaller and smaller mammals up to and including being a microorganism i remember going offline and coming back online a few times i remember seeing a coordinate graph where the line kept splicing off the edge and it felt like i kept dying it felt like i was shedding timelines where i actually died there but i kept surviving in this one i remember being in the bed in the ambulance with the emt and he would turn from male to female and i wrestled with the idea of male and female at the most abstract level almost like properties of the universe i remember reliving my life organized in different ways and coming back to the emt each time thinking that this is the infinite cycle of existence i have only small fragments after that but apparently i had a freak out moment in the hospital and they saw it as me being aggressive to one of the personnel i was arrested handcuffed and brought to jail charged with a felony simple assault on emergency personnel in jail my parents were not willing to bail me out without being on meds the jail system here is completely dysfunctional and theres basically no mental health support so there was no way for me to get on my meds after about days living in an open dorm situation the other inmates took notice of my behavior and obvious mental health issues theyre bored and destructive people so they preyed on my mental weakness and i stayed strong as best i could i cant go into every thought i had but there was a night that i thought my family was kidnapped and were being tortured and murdered one by one the inmates were feeding the thoughts and when it got to my daughter i couldnt hear anymore i went into the bathroom got as high as i could about feet jumped and pushed off the ceiling trying to land my head on the concrete i didnt lean back far enough and landed on my spine the pain was intense and i threw up the shampoo soap and cleaner that i drank about an hour earlier i shit my pants and was writhing in pain the officers rushed in to check things out i pleaded for them to shoot me telling them it will save my daughter i kept begging them to do it they told me to get up walking to suicide isolation i felt reassured that what i did put an end to them murdering my family i was in suicide watch for days which if someone werent suicidal would make someone i had no clothes but a velcro towel and i had to shit in a hole and smash the turd down with my foot so it would go through the bars i couldnt have more than a few squares of toilet paper nothing to read my bed was the concrete im not complaining because it is what it is its jail and i was there but what was the worst part is the back pain lying on the concrete no position felt good it was simply finding the least painful position and last as long as i could before that became too much and just keep shuffling to find something thats tolerable for just a moment after days there were enough people who got involved that i was finally able to get released on bail with a treatment order i got back on my meds and ive been on them since ive slipped into a real bad depression the charges were dropped days ago im resuming my job search its impossible to find a job with assault on your record the arrest itself can still be found if an employer does a certain background check but nothing i can do about that i slipped into drinking semiregularly but ive pulled out of that the last weeks all in all im holding on by a thread but there is hope oh i forgot that the night of the incident i had all my money k dollars in cash stolen from my apartment i have no proof but my intuition tells me that one of the officers took it when they were searching my apartment,2
ok hear me out im on mg of zirprasidone and i take propanolol for anxiety my meds help me tremendously like i hardly even have any bp symptoms anymore but heres the thing i cant feel anything during sex anymore nothing not a thing literally nothing its driving me nuts i can feel sex but i cannot feel any pleasure during sex anymore and it makes me feel left out and sad should i tell my psychiatrist about this what do i do its to the point where i get sad every time i have sex now,2
i had big plans growing up i was while horrible with anything math excellent in all other school subjects now i can barely write a paragraph without losing focus this disease has seriously messed me up its given me anxiety and inferiority and cognitive blocks that no nonbp person has to face i just want to come to terms with it i dont know what my abilities are how smart i am anymore im certainly not capable of any kind of degree or a job anymore i cant learn a trade or skill i couldnt be an electrician or an engineer or a programmer or a writer all i want more than anything is a purpose i would take a job even if i wasnt paid i cant volunteer though im simply not smart enough anymore im dumber than a rock now how do i just come to terms with the fact that i will essentially be forced to live with an eighth of my prior capacity for the rest of my life that i will never be able to enjoy an interesting article or cook for myself ever again because of the constant apathy and misery of persistent depression edit its been about a day and i was feeling really shitty for the past few weeks i feel much better now and dont even feel like the same person as when i wrote this also im reading your posts but a lot appeared at once and im not sure how to respond but thank you for the responses,2
ive been checking the website and it said out of stock im wondering if anyone got it before i want to use cost plus drug because it will save me so much money but im worry that it will take awhile to get the medication and if i can get a refill on time,2
im wondering if its a common experience for those of us with bipolar disorder to experience a commanding voice while in a mixed episode or mania when i start getting up i will hear a voice inside my head thatll tell me to do things usually to my determinant ive learned to ignore it but ive had to deal with having the occasional commanding voice since i was a teen does anyone else have to deal with a commanding voice i dont have too many bipolar friends and the ones i have we dont really discuss the disorder with each other,2
i think we all know how drinking goes with bipolar it only makes things worse i used to get drunk every day and had to detox several times before my diagnosis since then ive switched to binge drinking like once a week and its getting out of control im not taking my meds consistently my mood is all over the place im paranoid as hell and having near constant panic attacks so i havent had anything to drink since sunday and i got a prescription for naltrexone which im taking religiously i absolutely hate aa and dont have other inperson options in my area and i dont want people close to me to know how bad its gotten again so i feel really alone in this i have a great therapist and we talked about it today but if anyone has any tips or general encouragement id seriously appreciate it,2
for anyone wandering this is the app dailybean its great for tracking your mood,2
the absolute loneliness of this illness is something no one will ever come close to understanding it is something i will never be able to put into words their is nothing in this world i can fill this void in my soul with even in sleep it sits and waits for me to awaken so it can slowly eat away at me more and more the older i get the worse it becomes medication just numbs the feeling but it is always there below the surface i am so exhausted no matter how much sleep i get how long i lay on the couch stare at tv no matter how many pills i take the void eats away at me i am just so tired every muscle in my body feels like i have been working out for years with no rest days so tight like they might shatter like glass if i breathe the wrong way my fingers bleed from picking at them i am just so tired i am so lonely and i know the void will swallow me whole soon,2
i just want to start this off by saying that im aware that i have a problem and i want to fix it i am easily set off i mean really easily there are so many instances where i get set off by smalllighthearted comments at times i have gone off on people for really small things and it has ruined relationships this is while being relatively stable too what i mean is this has been when im not depressed or manic another thing ive noticed is that if someone makes a comment that hurts my feelings it really hurts me to the point where i become severely depressed and question why i should go on with life if i cant do xyz and people dont appreciate me there have been instances where friends havent responded to my messages right away and i explode one of those instances was when i was manic i have ruined those two friendships lately i have been really good about being able to recognize the feelings that im having and sit with them instead of releasing all of those negative emotions do any of you experience these things too is this just a normal part of being bipolar if you have experienced this what has helped you overcome these emotions,2
m basically i was diagnosed with biploar almost a year ago and im still reluctant to believe my disorder my family is very abusive and call me fake and dismiss whatever i might have as lazy or im just stupid my father has not talked to me since my diagnosis i recently dumped most of my lithium and bupropion out because the medication makes me feel unwell or it i hope they are right and im somehow just lying to myself or hearing only what i want to hear my brother is an epileptic and is employed so they compare his illness to whatever mine is pretty often they tell me hes way more deserving of treatment and care than me which i can kind of understand they all look at me with such shame and disappointment i already dont like myself to begin with and ive always felt like least favourite child anyways im not sure what to do move out once my lease is up i really dont know how much longer i can keep this up thank you for reading,2
hello there everyone ampxb ive been recently diagnosed with bipolar months ago and it has been a real struggle to live my day to day life like normal im finally on the right dose of lithium and started seeing good results with my emotions until my anxiety disorder decided to come back now i have to take seroquel to try to calm me down because im deeply afraid of everything now ampxb i think the mixed episode i just had scared me so much that now im terrified at the idea of having another one i almost dont want to feel better because i dont want to have hope thinking im okay now just to have a new episode right after i dont know how to explain it i know i want to feel better deep down because i feel miserable but im also afraid does anyone else feel the same,2
every once in a while ill have an intense urge to smoke i will buy a pack and smoke the entire thing in one day it wont make me feel sick or anything when i finish the pack i can go weeks without repeating wondering if anyone has some insight into this behaviour i also have a binge eating disorder that springs up similarly,2
expunge circumstances tired of the bland midwest too rural too passive aggressive i want to be manic in the city chongqing clubs and hotpot make me warm ahhh the energy living in hotels no stability swing me like a pendulum i want passion and extravagance im not meant for the norms expected of my thirties i want to be a wreck passed out on the floor chaos gives birth to experience i have so many but what to do with them,2
what the topic title says i find this to be the most debilitating illness ive ever faced the effort required to function at a normal level is draining for me personally i manage to do it but theres probably more days where i dont want to get out of bed to go to work even though i do so anyway by the time i get home i just lay down in bed to try and recover regardless of whether it was a good or a bad day,2
i am searching for help with keeping your mania from affecting your job relationships or responsibilities do you find it helpful to constantly reality check from the assumption that your reality is not the same as those around you meaning is it helpful to stop and ask is this normal before you do or say anything my boyfriend says this is not helpful but i am unsure of any other mania damage prevention methods,2
taking zoloft and lamictal had sex with a lovely lady for and a half hours to no avail im super frustrated and its not the first time it has happened any tips,2
i have been in what i think is a mixed episode my first normally my episodes are quite clearly defined for the past few weeks during it i have lost my job not my fault my partner my fault and i have given up i cant eat so have been surviving on milkshakes cant sleep only getting about hours a day and am under constant assault from my brain with negative images and thoughts its overwhelming and i just dont seem to have any fight left in me i am waiting for help from the community mental health team and for my medication to be reviewed but its taking forever and i am really not sure what i can do i am coming apart at the seams have no friends and am alone and i dont know what to do any advice or support is welcome update thanks for all the advice and support i have managed to eat solid food today it was not much but its a start and small steps etc,2
so ive just recently gotten into my first relationship im a f w a history of severe episodes amp see myself as fucked up beyond repair even though i have been more stable right now than i ever have im worried what should i know regarding navigating bp and being in a relationship and how far into the relationship did you guys have the im bipolar talk,2
this is ny first attempt at posting in a community specific to bipolar disorder ill start by saying i was diagnosed years back im a medical professional but im still struggling im currently on medication and im more or less okay according to my doctor im struggling because everything ive studied about my disorder whether in my books or online or from my doctor its difficult to believe that because my family has always been the tough love kind my father is never okay with me using the word bipolar disorder and has always said to call it depression because its just that my sister who is also a doctor also often tells me that my symptoms are anxiety and the common statement by both of them as well as my mom is that people have it worse than i am ive been working on my post grad exams and im struggling i have difficulty recalling and retaining what i read and i have gotten several anxiety attacks my family history is positive for bpd but currently its just me im completely lost because i dont know if im stupid or not my brain gets too loud sometimes i am scared of fightings and driving as well as being driven im told im too talkative i panic i forget things and sometimes i cant remember the right words but im told its all in my head nobody except my immediate family knows because mental health is still a taboo topic im completely lost and i dont know how to be normal,2
i am irritated today as fuck i dont understand why there was one situation that upset me my fault but could that be the reason i am usually a very calm stable person and now i am angry af yes i take my pills every day i dont want to do something stupid i am scared,2
i had gotten the genesight testing done genetic test where it gives some pointers on how your body metabolizes medications and im not too happy with the results ive been on mg lamictal for about months and ive been feeling great i feel like a regular person unfortunately the test showed i have a gene that makes me extremely susceptible to stevenjohnsons syndrome sjs the rash that can happen with lamictal and other mood stabilizers ive never had the rash but my doctor said i need to stop taking it to be safe hes putting me on an antipsychotic now which im not opposed to but im not happy about the fact that the medication im enjoying runs a high risk of a severe rash for me its frustrating and feels like the uphill battle of finding a good medication just got even higher has anyone experienced something like this before,2
this week i recently got out of a manic episode that was probably going on for about a month or so i was absent from school skipping almost all of my uni classes not studying got into car accidents and got a speeding ticket over limit in a school zone no sleep paranoid etc etc anyways now ive been trying to pick up the pieces especially with my grades in uni bipolar disorder has forced me to drop out a few times before but i really want to complete my degree doctor put me on lamictal which jolted me out of mania anyways the good news is today i talked to my professor and he was actually super understanding because his wife is also bipolar i hope my other professors as as understanding and will help me recover my grade,2
i was diagnosed bipolar along with a few other mental illnesses in i never have other bipolar people or friends to ask these questions hang with me here i hope this comes out correctly anyone else with bipolar constantly pick at their nails like i pick mine so bad they are killer sore and sometimes bleed i cant stand feeling the dry peeling skin rubbing against my other fingers ive been diagnosed so long and have taken tons of medication and i still feel like i just will never be normal like at this point what does a normal person experience in their day to day feelings ill go through a month of reading books on my kindle or regular books and finish them like in days i finished in a month same with watching a series on like hbo max or hului go through moods of deeply into the show and just binge it so fast amp then a week later its like i cant even focus or have enough attention span to watch anything at all my mind is constantly thinking about the next i need to do like it doesnt stop whatsoever only time i feel relaxed is when my night meds hitsleeping is the best bc it takes me from this hell of reality i struggle with daily there are many other issues i experience but these really have been bothering me lately and i catch myself wondering do other with bipolar have these issues or am i alone and just a wee bit crazy,2
woke up this morning feeling great and had energy but i know thats not a great sign because that hasnt happened in half a year or so at this point im just bracing for impact and waiting to see if its hypomania or not i say hypomaniamania because i experience both and my therapist still cant decide if its bipolar i or ii possibly an issue of deciding if the mania was actually full blown mania anyways i just woke up feeling good and i dont trust like that,2
ive been on topamax for about a month and a half now and just upped my dose a week ago things were going fine until this morning i have no idea if this related to the topamax but i woke up with a painful rash on my inner lips now the skin around my mouth is starting to feel dry and irritated and my lips are painfully chapped this rash on my lips is like nothing ive ever had before it almost feels like a burn but i didnt burn myself on anything i also feel extremely fatigued and generally crappy as of an hour ago does this sound like it could be the start of sjs should i be concerned im going to call my doctor in the morning if im not feeling better im just anxious right now,2
i have been trying new medications for about years now without much luck either really bad side effects or no mood improvement i see my psyc in a week to talk about which one to try next the clinic according to the website at least provides spravatoesketamine treatment im interested in asking him about it because i would like to learn more and i have read so many good things about it the research is remarkable i guess i am wondering how to bring it up this provider is semi new to me ive been seeing him for about months the reason i am scared to ask is because i have had other providers get weird when i ask for anxiety meds so if you have received this treatment beforehow did you go about it,2
hi doctors havent told me yet a diagnosis because maybe this is temporary but they told me it could be bipolar i dont believe in mental illness they are all symptoms of trauma and discrimination or whatever intoxication of delusional feelings that other brought into our minds we got fed up with them and developed an unhealthy mind and behaviour because we got stuck in them i think the wish to have power or isolating ourselves from others to be distinguished is something i noticed about me on the other hand we cant deny we are more sensible and perceptive but it is key to allways search for balance but we can question this also because why cant we have a society in which we encounter many surprises maybe it would be chaotic,2
i feel like my over obsession over a small incident this morning is an indication of a manic episode because now ive been feeling sad and depleted how long after diagnosis did you start being able to notice the signs,2
so let me use an example bc i do not know what to do with myself right now ive been having a very bad depressive episode this week and today i needed the help of someone very close to me who also happens to be my coworker i messed up life has been extra overwhelming lately and its hard to work i cant focus and even the smallest of things drain me even if those around me dont see it its so hard to do daily tasks im so tired of it all i messed up and there was an order i did not place by mistake i forgot about it and i even forgot what i had spoken to this particular client about i was sure he remembered who i was and i was terrified of looking like a dumbass and him asking for a supervisor bc this is the kind of person he is so i asked my friend to help me i was frantic and i am one to always help anyway i can when theres a mistake on their part or anything goes down no matter how busy i am with my own things they did not seem thrilled that i asked for help and didnt even get a confirmation on whether or not theyd help perhaps im making this bigger than it is but it was hurtful to see how unwilling they were to help me while i was panicking i rarely ask anything of anybody bc i have learned to be selfsufficient and bc with bipolar i have friends im just sad that i didnt get a smidgen of consideration and just went for it on my own issue is being resolved now and after minutes my coworker has approached me to say so what do i have to do meaning when i explained everything earlier including the solution they were not even paying attention i told them i got it now and they walked away annoyed is this me just raging for no reason did i just make this bigger than it really is or why would their reaction affect me so bad thank you for reading and sharing your view,2
woke up super depressed just like existential dread couldnt get out of bed i try to tell myself i can handle this disorder as long as it doesnt ruin my work life because i need the healthcare but i feel it slowly creeping in,2
i used to annihilate chapter books in a few hours this year i completely lost my ability to focus i am failing classes for the first time in my life for contrast i have a full ride university scholarship i havent been able to focus on textbooks for a few months but havent done real leisure reading in easily a year not because i dont want to just because i cant put in the time today i read an entire book pages in under hours i am so proud of myself i havent done this since middle school and i remember every part of it i didnt just skim it i dont want to get into the circumstances surrounding it or what it means as part of a larger whole i just want to celebrate that regardless of how or why i did it,2
ok so today was the deadline but i think as many of us for some reason i always wait till there is two days left to start working on important things words in two days and everything makes sense i am so happy i achieved it two months ago i attempted suicide and had to be sent to a psychiatric institution just wanted to share it with the group i hope i get an offer have a great day,2
ive been diagnosed for years and on latuda just as long and im really struggling with the brain fog way more than i used to i used to take modafinil for fatigue and i felt like a person again but i cant take it anymore due to circumstances out of my control and im wondering what people do to regain function it doesnt feel like the depression fog all that much it feels like my brain simply does not work i notice how im unable to understand even the simplest of things no matter how hard i try even things i used to be able to do without difficulty im considering dropping out of college because i simply cant work fast enough to keep up with the load and i cant stay awake long enough to work on things im taking caffeine pills and drinking absurd amounts of coffee to try and keep myself awake long enough to do anything but i dont think this is sustainable does anyone have advice that isnt go talk to your psychiatrist because i am but im turning to the community to see whats helped other people thank you,2
hellothis is my first post here and i hope its okay i was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in and took lamotragine since then was at mg twice daily my life changed for the better well last year things got rocky and i didnt have transportation to a physician so i cut the dose in half to make the medicication last mei took it that way for a year well now i am completely out and my mood is swinging like a tetherballi lost my health insurance a couple of months ago as well so now i just need to know coping methods that have worked for any of you that had to go unmedicated i never thought i would have to feel this way again but alashere i am i feel so so alone in this battle and so scared i finish my bachelors in june so hopefully i will have employment shortly after that and health care i am so scared,2
i tried a masters program in social work years ago before i was treated for my complex ptsd and before i was on lithium i know i would make a great therapist but i want to know how hard it could be with the work while having boom polar disorder been having dreams im in school for it thanks,2
does anyone have a job where they travel ive been thinking of transitioning from a job where i travel around counties to one in two states there would be overnight travel for a couple days each week i have a super stable government job now but the new one would align more with my interests im probably pushing the limits of my stability with this one,2
hello does anyone have bipolar disorder and adhd ive been taking adhd for the past decade my therapist wanted me to get an evaluation since it had been a while turns out i have adhd severe anxiety and bipolar disorder i take adderall and it helps me function never had issues with it so im wondering if i should get another opinion or is it normal to have adhd in my case its severe and bipolar disorder just a little concerned since i have to find a new psychiatrist now,2
how come i do not have the motivation i should its the basic stuff getting the mail emptying the dishwasher doing laundry brushing my teeth finishing anything i know who i am and i have more motivation than this,2
wondering how you experience the combo for me the anhedonia makes every hypomanic episode feel incredibly empty and frustrating i just feel increased energy and irritability and never good i never feel pleasure only thing i notice that improves is some motivation to socialize and date so i become very talkative and impatient but i never feel rewarded for the motivations i get its like an itch you cant scratch the increased mental libido with sexual dysfunction is also extremely frustrating anyone relate,2
so i f recently started depakote as of today its been about a week of taking it and its working really well for my mood swings and general bipolar i issues one thing ive noticed is i dont really want to eat i just dont get hungry ive heard everyone talk about increased appetite but since ive started taking it times a day ive just been eating a small breakfast and a small dinner because im just not hungry this isnt a problem because i am overweight and could stand to lose a couple pounds but its just weird that most medications ive been on have made me voraciously hungry seroquel for example made me the beast of the kitchen i would eat everything another thing ive noticed that might play into my loss of appetite is that everything tastes awful things i used to love now are kind of just meh im not necessarily complaining just wondering if any other current or previous depakote users have felt this way,2
i started taking a mood stabilizer and an antipsychotic after being diagnosed with bipolar type ii earlier last year it took a lot to admit there was an issue and to seek a psychiatrist i was proud of the progress i made this last year i felt great until a coworker made me feel like shit and that my progress meant nothing i have a coworker that is much older than me he frequently talks down to me in front of the entire team and has the attitude that his opinion is gospel no matter the circumstances im two years out of college with limited experience so i approached him about my frustration and how i can improve he got very defensive and denied any part in this instead of talking it through with me he monologued about mental health and seeking a therapist to talk about my frustrations at work instead i sat there and listened to him monologue trying to act like it was fine but damn did it hurt to be talked down to about my mental health i never told anyone about my diagnosis medication or treatment i always tried to prevent my bipolar disorder from affecting my job performance at all either the main issues were from how it affected my life outside of work im seeking a new job now but has anyone had experiences like this with coworkers,2
i struggle with eating i dont feel hungry until my head is pounding and im super irritable this morning i didnt have the energy to really cook myself anything but i knew i needed to eat to take my meds with this in mind i made some noodles and boiled an egg in the water just to get something in my system my partner asked what i had eaten and i told him he proceeded to tel me all about how i could get diabetes or become obese if i dont make better food choices and i need to make more nutritious meals for myself which i understand and i know hes coming from a good place with good intentions but i also did not ask for his opinion and was just trying to put something in my system so i could take my meds today it really hurt for him to say those things to me as if i am not trying my best to do the right things within my capacity for the day,2
does anyone else have any experience with this i always suspected i was bipolar but since being diagnosed a year ago im finding it harder to accept that its true any tips,2
been on a depressive episode for the last weeks i usually cycle with the seasons was living in canada for years which made my depression on winter unbearable now i live mexico and its way better my episode are not as severe and i guess for a moment i took it for granted that my episodes were mild and i was stable for a good while i work independently as an artist so if im not in the studio theres no one i have ti answer to which in general i love i love what i do and im so grateful to be able to do it im at stage in my life where im expanding my business and moving to a bigger studio space and its all great but the the episode started creeping in and i cant afford to give into it im getting all these anxieties and fears i know i can do this and have been fighting everyday but this week has been really hard im in the studio at the moment but havent been able to lift a finger trying all the skills and coping mechanisms i know help me plus my meds so really hope this ends soon letting all this out i think will help havent talked about it much with people as ive found i focus more on the feeling but needed to vent,2
i just found out my dog died so that added an extra layer of sadness im just crying nonstop now i feel like despite improving my circumstances and getting the help i needed this sadness is unshakable it feels almost like a failure that im still so sad i see my trauma everywhere the cycle keeps repeating again and again i dont want to enter another depressive episode again not knowing how fucking long itll last and fearing ill be depressed forever the anger and fear associated with my ptsd is mostly gone thankfully i just want to know how to change my life how do i stop feeling sad all the time despite being on four different medications im still not really functioning im doing much better than i was and im grateful for that but sometimes i dont know if this effort is worth it,2
i cannot shake the feeling that there are multiple people stalking my online presence and i feel like i cant even go on reddit because theres some secret account watching me i am having intense social paranoia i feel like my ex is watching me,2
its for a wellness center that he is recommending i go to hed rather not hospitalize me and this would be me volunteering to go i just dont see how i can spend what seems like minimum one month away from my family and my life what would everyone around me think if i just randomly disappeared for a month or more i know i have bigger problems but its of concern to me no access to cell phones or my job for that matter i just dont see how a married man with kids and a fulltime job can just disappear and go off the grid i have bills to pay and mouths to feed i am not sure how to handle any of this,2
theres not much to say im on abilify mg im on my way to adjust meds but rn im having a terrible mixed episode you probably know how does it feel so i just want to hear some advices on how can i survive without destroying my life or if theres something i can do to make this shit going away i hate it,2
i am going to tell you a couple things i have experience with i am telling you these because they effected me significantly and you can possibly understand your own position better by knowing this i had sessions of ect it was devastating logistically a nightmare and it did not work of marriages with one bp persons does not make it i was stunned by that knowing that about marriage has kept me single when they put the electrodes on they had problems because tears were running down my face god luck and god bless you,2
i have had a bitch of a time with mood swings for the past years and ive always white knuckled it out of partially shame and partially not realizing that wasnt normal i quit smoking weed and didnt sleep for weeks and went on a spiritual powwow and got arrested for breaking and entering it was at this point i realized i was not on a mission from god and then it got really scary because i went into psychosis while i was in the jail and i got pepper sprayed so i was laying on the floor choking and having no idea what was going on but luckily i didnt die and now i know that i need latuda,2
i just wanted like opinionsconsensus on this cuz im curious who in your life do you tell that you are bipolar i think this might be a bit of a generational difference here too i work in healthcare and hear the way people talk about bipolar patients all the time i dont have many genz coworkers for context most genx boomers or millennials and its abysmal im a millennial for context they talk about us the same way people would talk about people convicted for domestic abuse or a hit and run or a violent crime just disdain so i would never tell anyone at work that and broadly speaking these people are supposed to be empathetic and nice healthcare workers so i feel like i have a pretty good idea of what people actually think of us when they dont have to be politically correct about it cuz they know they arent speaking to people who will be directly hurt or offended by what they have to say ive noticed younger people like people on tik tok or like just in general not only talk about it but put it front and center as a key piece of their identity they put it in cover letters that go out to job applications and to me this just seems wildly nave i wish we didnt live in that world but we have negative stereotypes about being late being unreliable or substance abuse issues and even though a lot of us dont do those things often or at all people who have power to dictate important parts of our lives like what jobs and opportunities we have will go with default assumptions like those and will go with the safer pick the person who doesnt specify that or the one who doesnt have that info readily available on tik tok youtube insta facebook i appreciate awareness generally but i would caution people about where they are broadcasting what and to whom dont give other people a reason to slam the door on you before they even meet you curious what other people from all different age groups think,2
i feel like i dont actually have bipolar i was diagnosed but i feel like i might have been faking it i dont know im on meds now and i was diagnosed years ago so i dont remember my mom tells me the way i was acting was very scary but i think i might have just been acting my family always notices when im off of my meds but i think it might just be because im myself again is this feeling normal,2
after my bachelors degree passing out in i enrolled myself in a masters program abroad in where i first had an episode and i had to come back and drop out im on medication since and in continual therapy after me abruptly leaving my degree course i thought ill take up a job in my home country and i did i worked for a year and then i just couldnt continue i had hormonal issues because of my medication and severe depression i was suicidal and i couldnt attend a single meeting without crying i left my job this year after revealing that my mental health is not appropriate for work right now and i need a break now again im planning to do my masters abroad as my boyfriend lives there and i want to live with him its either masters or a job in my home country for a year and then masters both options feel difficult and i feel like i can not make it i have been feeling so stressed that i feel i should give up on life because i cant do anything with my career and i cant survive like a dead body i have to do something sometimes i feel so paralysed that i feel like im a financial burden to my family and will be a burden on my boyfriend as well if i move,2

hi all apologies because this is a long one but im hoping some have been through something similar i am in the newer phase of my onset where were still trying to medicate me correctly i just got off a call with my psych who is upping my lamictol and has told me zero substances for a while and well reevaluate once im stable ive been a stoner for years but have tapered off after receiving my diagnosis and learning it was counterproductive however its still a way i unwind or work up an appetite and ill definitely miss the calming aspects of the ritual with alcohol i definitely increased my consumption with onset of symptoms and never get to a sloppy blackout level but i drink with dinner at a low amount whenever appropriate ive also been taking ritalin for a long time as i was previously diagnosed adhd although thats being reevaluated now since bipolar is often first misdiagnosed as adhd and shes requested i drop that too because stimulants can worsen symptoms i know its best to stop and see where it gets me the fact that im irritated about stopping proves to me that its a good idea in the past ive had issues with extreme boredom during sobriety and im also worried about stopping since it has become sort of a band aid for the pain i am worried that when i get manic sad or bored my resolve to stay sober will crumble i would really appreciate tips or mantras maybe something to replace the sort of feeling from any of those anything is appreciated,2
im super motivated and driveni work hard and are succesfuli have the typical loss of memory and cant focus a lot of the time but have found ways to get passed it i have an anger issue howevergo against me an im just like fuck youyou know like tell me i do something slightly wrong and i will be like then fucking show me dumbass i do everything alone as a result i succeed and make friends i just ignore them and avoid everyone once i do i run a successful fb account and recently had a manic episode where i lashed out at everyonefor no reason just spazzing it resulted in people acting very petty and as a result i just got worse and worse i feel like its getting more annoying as time goes on like eventually someone with the wrong attitude is going to want to get into an altercation with me my medications have helped and talking to a therapist helps but i cannot seem to just control this rush of adrenaline i get over every little thing like the movie crank but with normal stuff any one else have this issue,2
i have been self harming for over years now im horribly embarrassed that i still slip into doing it even as an adult i feel as though a lot of people view it as a teenager only thing ive been doing it less and less over the years but the fact that i still do like i said makes me embarrassed if you have a similar experience any advice or personal stories would be nice but no pressure i downloaded an app to help track how long ive gone without doing it just needed to vent thank you,2
i dont think i have the drive or energy to want to get better i live in absolute squalor and dont even care even when im happy i dont do things that normal people do to maintain their life what am i supposed to do if i literally fail to do anything,2
i finally got diagnosed after years of me having breakdowns and making gp appointments and desperately asking doctors to tell me whats wrong with me it took a mental health nurse to see something was really wrong and she got my seen by a psychiatrist who diagnosed me with unspecified bipolar and ive now also been referred for an adhd assessment i dont feel any better though well of course not nothing has actually changed i have been taking lamictal but not feeling any positive effects yet i had been told for years its depression anxiety and one doctor said it sounded hormonal i thought that i would get better i thought that i would recover and live a healthy normal life i feel like i have to mourn the idea of this now im not getting much help behind this diagnosis they say because ive never been hospitalised and i manage to hold down a job and maintain relationships i dont need it i get it but it hurts i feel invalidated confused and alone i managed to get myself a good job at a company i could have only dreamed of working for i am fucking it up though i do nothing most days im so consumed by whats going on in my head whether its good or bad im going to have to go back to a less demanding job which breaks my heart and i feel if leave it will trigger an episode im scared ill impulsively quit one day too like my last jobs maybe ill get fired first anyway i have an amazing support system and have cut off anyone who wasnt good for me im also in a loving relationship with someone i want to spend the rest of my life with i have to fight thoughts about sabotaging these relationships though theyre so annoying i tell myself but actually im just irritable and they really care about me which can be hard to believe despite everything appearing good to others i am so chaotic ive stopped pretending now when people ask me if im okay i tell them no i feel crazy everyone tells me i need a routine but it is impossible my life on paper is great and in reality it is too to be honest its boring though ive gone sober too i feel ungrateful almost i am the problem and i am losing my mind i feel like ive been fighting the crazy in me for years but im exhausted and i dont want to anymore im sick of doing the right things and whats good for me this diagnosis has brought up some scary thoughts like now my insane moods are justified i dont need to hold back anymore i also then think though if ive been able to keep complete madness at bay then i guess im actually not that unwell i just feel like a prisoner of my own mind,2
i notice myself switching jobs quite often i just applied for an inpatient psych unit hoping to god that i get in i need more money but this disability makes it so fucking hard i work in case management currently mostly doing education for patients in the clinic its a low profile job and it doesnt pay that great for what i need im afraid one day we wont be able to pay for the essentials ive worked the floor rehab research home health and now my current job ive hated everything i keep getting depressed then i want to change jobs again i can only hope that my current application will go through i need more money and i need those students loan repayments that they offer i have great health insurance through where i work currently but again it just simply does not pay enough for me can anyone else relate to this i really hate my life right now,2
what do you believe in religion spirituality universe higher power or nothing etc i am curious to know what others with bipolar believe in and also if your experiences with being bipolar have impacted those beliefs,2
im on my fourth night of having trouble sleeping ive been getting hours of sleep a night so im paying attention to it but not super concerned and was just wondering what other people do in this situation do you make yourself lay in bed even if you feel wide awake when does it cross the line for you and make you seek medical care,2
im in a really low place right now and i want to talk to my therapist about this without getting sent for a grippy socks stay im really worried that ill end up in this horrible psych hospital again and to be honest i would rather be dead than go back there how can i bring this up with them without it being possible i end up sectioned,2
hi first post to this sub if anything i say is not allowed please let me know in a message even if you do remove the post so i can be more mindful in the future kinda nervous moving forward but today i finally went to a psych and after about an hour of talking about different things she settled upon one sure for diagnoses of bp and immediately prescribed latuda mg at night during dinner i had spoken with a therapist years ago and was on trintellix and also tried zoloft which did nothing but give me headaches and the other made me rage out respectively i found out many of the things i do in my daily life are actually symptoms of both mania and depression and that im going through episodes of both multiple times a day for the past years that we covered i also have chrons disease and i saw how it can affect weight and appetite so im hopeful it can boost that as well as get my racing thoughts insomnia and hyper productivity to a normalmanageable level im very leery about taking it with the experiences ive had with antipsychotics in the past but my dr also works with my wife who is adhd and bp and ive seen how our dr has helped her by listening to her and not just her diagnosis im on a month trial at the mg so hopefully no severe side effects or medication interactions and this does what it needs to and i apologize ahead of time to those on this sub i will most likely be spam reading a lot of your posts in the coming days just to understand different perspectives of this cause i wont say i love it but i have a special thing about researching all i can about new things especially medical thank you all in advance,2
first time poster on this sub but i feel like i need support sorry for the format i am on mobile i feel like my psychiatrist at my most recent appointment was talking to me in a way that made it feel like i was being stupid or taking myself too seriously on what my problems could be im diagnosed with a mood disorder and my previous psychiatrist strongly suspected i may be bipolar due to the symptoms i experience ive been open and shared a lot of my issues with my psychiatrist but he doesnt seem to care what really grinded my gears though was him saying well im not sure if you really are bipolar because you dont show one of the most common symptoms which is the lack of need for sleep and i dont mean only needing or i mean more like to which i had to tell him that no i have had that back in high school most prominently i never was diagnosed with bipolar and didnt know what it was before i started my mental health journey so at the time i didnt think much of having little to no sleep when younger and figured it was normal to go a day or two without sleeping to which he asks me well how did that change over the course of time its called forcing myself to get tired by mentally or physically exerting a lot and also becoming a single parent helps with getting tired a lot faster i felt horrible and hurt because it felt like i had to justify to myself that im not crazy that its not normal to struggle going to bed before midnight that feeling crazy swings back and forth isnt normal i have an appointment with my therapist tomorrow and i feel like expressing to him how the psych treated me made me feel like im being stupid or blowing things out of proportion i hate this and i hate feeling out of control of my own emotions most of the time and i just want to be taken seriously i see now why so many women struggle to get diagnosed its all in your head or thats just normal for a woman to be moody have any of you ever had this happen on your journeys to getting help with your diagnosistreatments i want to know im not alone,2
hello i just started seeing therapist privately and she said what i say its definitely similar to bipolar disorder she has seen me once ive seen more therapist in the past in the public system except for one which was really good but i was in an up moment the other just said that i was fine and dumped me im scared but also happy that finally someone understands what i feel and that my struggles are validated and im not making it up or just being lazy and a bit weird sometimes i just wanted to share as except for my boyfriend and a friend i dont want to tell anyone right now thank you,2
hey everyone i m have had a mental illness all my life that being adhd i was on medication for it for about eight years until last year when i began to feel different my adhd used to consist of hyperfixation hyperactivity and inability to concentrate so normal adhd stuff but last year before i graduated high school in may i noticed something was changing i assumed it was my adhd just evolving with new symptoms as i got older but towards graduation time and shortly thereafter i realized i was wrong it began to get worse with huge depressive episodes i would cry or feeling like crying some days and be fine the next and i would feel worthless like i didnt mean or contribute anything and then have confidence that soared through the roof i started snapping on people and then being okay the next second the anger and mood swings problems got worse within the past few months i work retail and ive been showing attitude and anger and even hatred one moment and then im super happy and energetic the next second even outside of work i snap at my parents my best friend and have constant negative emotions i have started talking supersuper fast without realizing and feel like my thoughts are going a million miles an hour my psych mentioned this to me yesterday one of the biggest things that coincides with the anger and mood swings is my impulse control and motivation one thing i lack is impulse control i know something is wrong but i still choose to do it anyway this has affected me with porn gaming too much and most importantly spending i have credit cards and i paid them off a month ago and once again i have a huge balance on both because i know i shouldnt be spending money but in the moment it feels like i should also the lack of motivation issue is huge i want to go to the gym i want to go out and do things but i just cant no matter how hard i force myself to try after an argument with my mom about how shes worried about me and how she knows something is wrong i came clean and told her that ive been keeping how ive been feeling from her my dad sisters and my psychiatrist and therapist i was afraid to be on new medicine and to be diagnosed with something new my psych told me that sometimes adhd can evolve or even be mistaken for bipolar since the two share similar symptoms i was put on latuda yesterday and i feel no difference yet since it takes weeks or more to do so but im hopeful and hopefully i can learn to live with this since its a part of me now,2
i feel so isolated and afraid things are turning crumbling i feel like i cant turn to anyone my psychologist and doctor understand but damn the nights are so long and in the day i have to be around so many people i cant tell whats going on for me some professionals even dont understand me unless they know me very well im a serial masker and even when im wanting to throw a chair through a window ill just casually say im raging right now and they dont take notice lol so some professionals dont take notice and others say things like im very alarmed at my behaviour i just cant be that person i used to be anymore exploding rage and emotion luckily a have professionals that see the signs clearly but talking to others can make me feel invisible i feel like everyone in society the world around me online is watching everything im saying and doing even people in cars or shop assistants which i know sounds ridiculous but i feel like i cant move a muscle or say a thing its constant its even hard to post here it was fun with the spiritual and sensual bliss but now its just hell i made the mistake of having a nap before midnight and i wont sleep tonight i got an exam today ill see my nurse thankfully then my therapist but right now i just see this long stretch of night ahead of me the house is so quiet im worried ill see ghosts if i leave my room lol i just feel so very alone college helped so much theyre very supportive there my classmates are amazing but its getting confusing for me there too my mouth is starting to get me in trouble i feel like my world is getting smaller section by section my psychologist said it was ok for me to go to a buddhist centre for a few days as long as i dont drive there as long as i stick to grounding meditation rather than the transendental stuff lol so maybe that will help me a lot i dont even know what this post is about its just all crumbling down now i might try to switch channels in my brain rather than hyperfocusing on my phone have something to eat and drink maybe try sleep again im focusing so inwardly thoughts feelings etc i need to get out of my head and into my body i try to do the mindfulness things but im too paranoid about ghosts right now i wanna listen to my headphones but cant for the same reason i think im literally too afraid to leave my bed or do anything but type and too paranoid to ring a hotline im dreading am but hopefully i will be asleep by then i dunno maybe this post is an ask for someone out there to make me feel like im not one alien on an earth full of humans lol either way i just gotta get it off my chest,2
i recently did intake with a medication management clinic because i wanted to renew the prescriptions my nowretired psychiatrist gave me but they informed me that two of the meds ambien and ativan they dont prescribe at all and wellbutrin is not something they would let me take without an antipsychotic because i already have some samples from my old doctor ive been told to start vraylar after looking it up i am very hesitant to take it i have a number of other medical and emotional issues having to do with weight gain and suicidal thoughts among other things and what i read has me worried i just wanted a little help me out of the downturn rut im in and ease my anxiety and hypervigilance i have my swings but havent been hospitalized in years basically since i stopped taking mood stabilizers i tried a bunch of different ones in the last years this a clinic not a personal relationship like with all the pdocs before and i dont think the lengthy computerized questionnaire is set up to flag the nuances of my requirements like weight neutral or not mind numbing i just want to comfortably exist in the world able to think clearly enough to get things done and without the paranoia edge that i live with now but if muscle jerks increased hospitalizations and diabetes are the price i have to pay maybe life as a hermetic loner is something i have to just accept,2
anyone else feel like the clock change messes with your whole status it feels like someone picked up my world gave it a little shake and put it back down my sleep suffers my focus tanks and my moods drops,2
mornings are rough for me so i pick my clothes the night before i have to wake up early so i dont have to think about it this morning the pants i chose were covered in lint and i couldnt find the lint roller i started freaking out felt like i was spiraling and even started crying because how u expected it was and its hard for me to make decisions now i want to have things ultra organized so i can try to stay in control of my enrionmsnt which can help me stay in control of my emotions my bf witnessed my freak out and its just so embarrassing he doesnt say anything he just lets me self soothe unless im having a really hard episode hes still learning about my diagnosis its just so frustrating and its hard to not judge and hate myself for not being able to control my reactions,2
i was wondering if you guys had any derealization at all i see it as feeling like im in a dream being extremely detacheddisconnected to people and things around me to the point where it seems like the crowds of people around me are just part of a random setting im in everything around me is blurred and that type of stuff i was wondering if this is normal for the majority of people right now bc of covidsocial media etc im doing my own research now but i just started unpacking this after my therapist pointed it out,2
i was recently diagnosed with bipolar depression after reading more and more of the posts on this reddit ive finally felt like ive found the people ive been looking for i cannot even find the words to express how isolating it is trying to describe some of the symptoms to people they try their best to relate but no one ever gets it the struggles with time distortion between hypomania and depression the cleaning and reorganizing because you feel like im doing so you have reinvented yourself the countless abandoned hobbies picked up during a manic episode where you feel like you posess the ability to learn everything at a superhuman rate the changes in how much sleep you need feeling like a different person snapping at people and regretting half of the decisions youve made the suicidal thoughts its all so overwhelming but seeing that others are dealing with the same type of life and coping with it actually brought me to tears tonight thank yall for sharing your experiences i didnt realize how much something like this could help,2

hi im new to reddit and have been using facebook and tiktok as my resources besides reading articles about bipolar disorder i was diagnosed years ago with bipolar and im still trying to figure it out been off and on with my meds currently off with approval of psychiatrist ive been trying to figure this out still its hard but im still trying to figure out my mania right now i feel like im making risky choices like playing with fire with my marriage and sex life is infidelity part of mania i know ive heard and read many different things on mania and i know some people on the pages have struggled and this is why their marriages fail and i feel im at risk with mine but i miss this risk part which is why i think i want to play with fire i just need some advice on what you guys do with your mania highs or if this was normal,2
has anyone elses bipolar wrecked their relationship i have bipolar with psychotic features and i found out about it a year and a half ago i also was also very recently diagnosed with cptsd due to an abusive childhood i had a partner that i absolutely adored but after a huge life stressor i started to experience psychosis and paranoia and broke up with him because i strongly believed he was plotting against me and planning to hurt me i then went through a series of depressive and manic episodes following the break up when i finally got stabilized i reached out to him hoping to rekindle only to find out he had moved on with a girl who probably isnt a complete psycho like i am i wasnt as good a girlfriend as i couldve been either because of my unstable moods and lack of energy basic life skills girlfriend experience i wish i could do it all over again and just really show him how much i loved him it just tears me up inside i miss him so much im sure he hates my guts it honestly makes me want to stop living because i miss him so much i dont think ill ever find anyone else who can handle my craziness im unlovable,2
weird question but if someone was not ever admitted or treated for drug induced mania how long will that last for before they crash and do different drugs effec the length of manic episode,2
so i know this wasnt a good idea but after about months of taking my medication regularly lexapro lamictal and abilify i stopped taking them cold turkey i stopped seeing my psychiatrist because it felt like a chore but i do see my therapist regularly for a while after stopping my medication i started drinking every single night to get rid of the uneasiness i felt and just to help me sleep drinking really became a nasty habit for me one night after work i took it too far ive had problems with a toxic relationship for a while and while at work he ended up blocking me out of spite and i didnt care much because i knew i would just go home and a have a drink but that night i came home and got so drunk i started getting super paranoid that someone was watching me and i was crying and i guess talking on the phone so loudly my mother came to check on me im and still live with my parents but i was upset because she started questioning if i was drunk and said to hang up the phone but i told her i was finally happy and i dont remember much from that night but apparently the next day my mom told me tht i got violent with her and threatened to beat the fuck out of her if she didnt leave me alone anyways because of that night i havent had any access to alcohol and im proud of myself for sticking to that because i would even drink at my boyfriends house and he could get me drinks if i wanted but ive been good with it and the only substance i put in my body is nicotine now but now that ive been good with that stuff ive become angry and i pick fights with whoevers around me i get violent and suicidal thoughts and im at a point where i feel worthless i dont think my environment is helping me i dropped out of college and i know my parents are disappointed in me because of my mental health its been hard for me to get a job and now i have a part time in the mall and its a really good environment and very distracting however my dad is on my case about how its not a real job and im pretty much useless in the house and i dont contribute to anything i want to respect him and do more but its hard to be in a house where everyone is depressed and projects their issues my mother is also bipolar but is always giving me advice she cant take i know its not easy having a kid whos bipolar but it seems like they dont even try to understand me everyday i wake up and feel so stuck i feel like i dont have a place here even my hardest isnt enough i dont want to be here anymore im tired and angry i have no interest in anything anymore other than sex and work because it at least distracts me also my cat too shes the reason why i wake up every morning other than that i have no interest in doing anything with my life i dont care about anything and i never have really im tired but here i am at in the morning unable to sleep because im burdened by my thoughts,2
hi guys so i am a bipolar and i havent actually told anyone but few about my bipolarity anyway i believe being a bipolar affects the way i am thinking and the decisions i make according to my emotions which are instable and which will eventually lead to a feeling of regret and guilt later so my problem is that now while the usual and frequent depressive episodes trigger this depressive episode is the worst so far i live in this paradoxical loop and cycle between my past and all these nostalgic moments i am always recalling in my mind that could make me sometimes happy but also crying because i miss these moments so much and miss the people that i dont see anymore but have been a great part in my life nevertheless left me for either no reason or with a reason that i couldnt really do anything about it my present which is affected negatively by my nostalgia and emotions for the past and taking a great amount of time just living in the memories living in the past and dreams instead of living in the present time and my future which l do think about but dont care about it anymore sometimes i used to think about my future to forget about the past but failed to do so thinking about what i could do in the future makes me a bit happy nevertheless when these nostalgic moments hit me it just converts me from a happy person to a sad desperate and disappointed person again that eventually lead to deep depression which cause suicidal ideation mostly to overdose to death but ends up with failed attempts to commit suicide i cant even determine if these memories are good or bad by now cuz it depends as well sometimes i just get the good parts of the memories while other times i just get the tragic parts and events that happened to me as for getting bullied recently at the university losing my best friend losing my boyfriend etc i just believe by now that good memories are even worse and more hurtful than the bad ones it just feels like getting stabbed in the back these many emotions and mixedup thoughts i get give me a headache and usually panic attacks that sometimes i cut myself with a nearby sharp thing as well i also have adhd social phobia and severe trust issues i now feel so bad that i wish this world to stop and my life ends thinking about suicide already makes me more comfortable to end my struggle you know so ive been asking if i am alone on this does anyone relate to my experience,2
i want to know how yall cope with your past like general traumas and trauma from things that happened to you and things that you did during manic episodes i find it hard and have intrusive thoughts about them id love to know how yall manage these feelings have a great day everyone,2
i was just wondering if there are others who have bipolar without any family history im literally the only mentally ill person in my family it makes me question my diagnosis when the disorder is supposed to be heavily genetic theres obviously something wrong with me and the bipolar diagnosis fits but still,2
tw self harm along with some of what youd expect in mania be specific with examples if youre willing i want to see how bipolar varies for people because sometimes i feel invalid heres a list of my symptoms as well in case anyone also needs some reassurance that everyones different for me its losing sleep but not quite all of iti have an anxiety med that increases need for sleep though so that could play a role paranoia about all my friends and the world around me risky decisions in terms of conversations with friends putting myself in a physically dangerous position and the things i put inside my body hearing whispers feeling like god and being pretty good at convincing myself i am sensory issues specifically with touch making boatloads of artwork its my hobby overemoting slf hrm but not taking time out of my day to do it just doing a project or task and being like i bet i can hrt myself doing this talking a lot and having something to say about everything doing tasks super rushed and poorly the urge for violence verbal or physical not responding to people because im in a thrill of art or work leaving my house at any hours during the nightday etc ill edit if i think of anymore,2
i yelled and screamed at my friend via phone using cursing words for minuites during my hypomaniac episode the reason was that my friend who does not really knows about this disease joked about suicide the context was like sorry ill just die in an friend chatroom while my head was literally full of suicidal intentions and i warned for several times that it triggers me now i am receiving no messages from him for a week which is unusual and am really confused is this relationship toxic does he deserve apology first or do i deserve apology first i think i still value my friend but wtf is happening with my life would be great to get some advice thanks note i am taking meds and visiting doctor chatgpt just repeatedly recommends this,2

when i see normal people constantly talk and have fun with it im genuinely shocked how the hell do they have something to talk about all the time how do they know what would be interesting to the person they talk to it feels like i operate on lvl of social skills while everyone else is already on lvl nobody around me has the same lvl so i cant even train to become stronger doomed to lose every encounter,3
i really enjoy watching people live their lives listening indirectly to their conversations while in public being an observer of events etc my problem is having to interfere on the world i hate having to talk and to do things that will have consequences in it i wish i could just watch life like a tv show or as if i was a ghost in a way that no one could see me nothing would be expected of me and i wouldnt need to worry because i would be certain of it i could just contemplate the world in peace some of you guys may have watched euphoria and i definitely feel a connection with the description made about lexi how she felt like she was an just observer and that her life was not really her life just some sort of play or movie these days i been having the classic i want to leave all behind and live in the woods with just a dog idea and daydreams and i guess that a big part of it is because i feel like there i could be like this or at least similar enough be an observer of nature never having to deal with socialization again only brief interactions for lets say buy necessary stuff from other people which i dont mind i know this isnt realistic for my context and also that it probably wouldnt be this magical thing but its a fantasy that brings me satisfaction i guess im just burned out of people a lot of bad things happened in my relational and social life since childhood till last year and im really bitter about it right now of course i want to find real connection where i could be myself openly and comfortably but because it always goes wrong and brings disappointments im really hopeless at this point and honestly kinda angry i dont have patience for people anymore im tired im being judgy as hell and im activelly avoiding new people,3
lately i just feel like garbage i havent left the house much in like weeks and ive been missing class it all feels too overwhelming for me but being at home makes me feel like trash tooi cant win i cant sleep right either i wake up every other hour and im so tired i feel so angry and anxious lately too because i feel as if everyone hates me and that theyre happier without me my friends hardly talk to me lately i see them on social media chatting and making plans to callplay games and im never included lately im not surprised though whod want to be friends with someone as depressed and broken as me i want to crawl in a hole and disappear,3
i work from home as a software developer most aspects of the job are too triggering and i cant handle it every morning starts with a daily update meeting since i usually had done only minutes of work the previous day i have no update to give i panic and have to lie and the lie is transparent afterwards i have to cool down from the shame guilt and stress its already hard to recover from the procrastination because everything i do with the code or on slack has a timestamp a notification and is visible to everyone once theres something im avoiding committing code deploying code posting the code for review responding to someone testing code an upcoming meeting etc i often go offline from inactivity and then im afraid to even open my laptop which can take hours to overcome because once i do everyone can see im online on slack my procrastination then is immediately visible to the people who are impacted and who are looking for it ie people im not responding to my manager i already got in trouble for not doing my work missing meetings not responding to people for days or weeks and just not showing up some days without telling anyone i was put on a monthlong probation which ive gotten past only because i didnt ghost entire days during that time i have frequent meetings with my manager and i have to pretend im struggling way less than i am i cant admit that half or more of the days i do absolutely nothing or how much communicating with people the most important part of the job so fundamentally terrifies me i know every trick in the book about procrastination time management breaking down tasks but thats not enough when im this afraid of people ive accepted i need help from another person ive talked about this some with friends but none of them understand so all they can provide is sympathy i have a psychiatrist and ive been trying to find a therapist but theyve all been unhelpful many actively harmful i know its a slow process but every single day at work is like torture and im on very thin ice because i cant get the work done its not endurable and i dont have the time or energy to work on all the other parts of my life in dire need of work i dont want to quit because i havent been here that long and i had a big gap between quitting my previous job for the same reasons but i cant stay like this for months until i find someone and begin making progress i dont know what to do,3
im and dont have a stunningly high body count it never used to bother me but once i hit my s and people i knew hit that phase of sleeping around and doing the casual relationship thing it just hooked into my brain i tried to do the whole hoe phase thing but im terrified of everything around being more intimate with someone making moves doing things right my own body just not being able to keep up the act ive got going and having to have someone see all of me you know and on paper i know its fine not everyone on earth is hoeing it up either side of the spectrum is fine but my brains really latched onto this as another thing that makes me different from everyone else and something people are going to judge me for like im not a person because no ones ever really wanted me amp every time someone brings it into conversation i just feel physically sick with how much of the biggest freak i feel like im sorry if this barely makes sense i just really needed to get this off my chest,3
hi dear community i have a question my partner has avpd we have been dating for some months and i noticed that when hes going through an anxiety episode or moment he sort of physically avoids me for example if he feels embarrassed or has low self esteem particularly high that moment he will hide behind his laptop or walk behind or in front of me distancing himself physically while still being kind its more of a way of hiding from me when he cant actually leave for example when we share a hotel room on vacation i did notice that when i grab his hand to hold mine while walking that he does reciprocateeven when he tried to walk behind me or further away from me but im not sure if he does it to please me but dislikes it or if he likes it that im gently being reassuring and consistent my dear avpders when feeling low do you like being comforted or do you truly want someone to take distance and leave you alone i just want to learn how to handle the situation so he feels comfortable thanks everyone,3
i feel like ive had a realization in the last few months that i wanted to share its that one of the ways forward with this disability for me is to learn how to honestly express myself without distortion and to do that constantly without regard for the fact that it causes me pain and discomfort i used to cope with my issues by putting on a mask of a personality that i built using self help books and a desperate need for approval basically just the fake it til you make it strategy although i became more conventionally likable it truly did not help in the long run as i was never able to get close to people now i am back to an ultimately isolated life but im trying something different its very challenging to me and not always doable but i think it is necessary and that is to view socializing as a simple and honest expression of myself between others when i have a thought or opinion or feeling say it put it out there in some way for better or worse also treat what others say as true expression of their being this may sound silly but i think it is a subtle seeming thing that is actually big deal as i said its challenging and not always doable this is because a deeply negative emotional and sometimes physical reaction to the idea of expressing most things in my mind for fear of embarrassment or rejection my brain going blank due to weariness and therefor not having anything to express the fact that isolation makes me depressed and lonely so the things on my mind can bring the vibe down but regardless i realize that this is what i have to do and that watching myself mindfully and purely expressing whats on my mind is the only way forward usually what happens when i force something out is that i brace for impact brace for embarrassment rejection etc usually i assume that people are secretly embarrassed for me for whatever i said but whether or not that is true isnt important ive been trying a lot of tools of expression such as music writing and drawing and i think these are helping me learn how to express myself naturally anyway im tired of pretending im not sure if i will ever be able to speak without fear and shame but at least i wont have to strain myself into a safe caricature maybe this seems like crazy person thoughts but i hope someone relates or understands,3
it is not possible to know what it is like to experience the world from inside someone elses body but i can infer from others that people enjoy being with other people more than i do it is rare that i enjoy a persons company usually i look forward to being alone again instead of pleasure i do feel an absence of loneliness or fear but these are not pleasure i very much experience health benefits from being with other people i cant deny this but in the moment i feel like something important is missing to say it different i dont feel a desire to be with others unless i am wanting to soothe or avoid loneliness or fear by default being alone is peaceful and ideal is it really anhedonia or is it also possible that my default is actually that the social anxiety overpowers the social pleasure so that i cant feel feel and it takes a really strong negative emotion to overpower social anxiety in order to provoke a desire to be with others wish i understood so that i could participate more in life,3
im years old i hope everyday that someone else than my mom would see me find something they like about me and decide to brush me off and give me a piece of shelter ive been through too much shit to start over with my family and i just want to feel like i matter and i can make a difference,3
like breaking stuff thats not yours or forgetting to do something important im a perfectionist and every time i screw up it kills my mood and sends me into a spiral of self loathing suicidal thoughts appear immediately cant help but see myself as an antimidas and thats one thought that usually proves itself to be true i just had a bit of a fuck up dont care to go into detail about it but moments like this are why avoidance makes sense it never wouldve happened if i didnt take the chance,3
so throwaway because im afraid she might be in this sub before asking the real question long story short tldr at the end so me m and this girl f matched on tinder a year ago we want on a date and then she ghosted me the day after tried to talk to her one day after few months got a single message reply and then she disappeared again at the end of last year i notice she was on hinge saying she broke up with her bf so i started posting instagram stories that she mightve been find interesting and she started liking them so after a while i reached out to her and wishing a happy new year she seemed kinda interest so we made plans for the following week she ghosted me again i was disappointed after few days i noticed she had put me back in the close friends she removed me from it after the first ghosting so i thought mh she might be to ashamed to write me back after all this time ill reach out again and since then we never stopped talking anymore but here comes the problem we just talked for a couple months i tried not to push anything to dont let her make uncomfortable and run away again but she basically is just venting on me and now she started venting also about male friends on and on so i got suspicious and i was right shes back on hinge with a fresh new verified and recently active profile now here comes the problem and i dont mean her being on hinge at least not directly shes in therapy and on meds im pretty sure her therapist wouldnt suggest her to be on hinge correct me if im wrong she said she couldnt drink cause of meds and of med swings but few days ago she started hanging out at night she couldnt do it before hanging out with me couple weeks ago with a male friend and wanted to get drunk she said shes to anxious to hang out with people outta blue we were talking about hanging out again said she was super busy got even more busy with college lessons but she found the to hang out with somebody else while im being her emotional support for the last months didnt text me back for couple days after hanging out with that guy so the real question is how do i gently end up things with her i dont want to make feel her guilty but i cant keep stressing myself this much i thought shed made progress with her therapist but apparently she isnt doing much of what they says so i think she might be helpless and toxic and mostly we arent on the same page i truly love her and i think she knows but shes playing with me and using me just to vent and for not feeling completely lonely tldr after being ghosted multiple times with a girl with avpd adhd and probably bpd too im referring what she said to me we seemed to bond for once but she might be a toxic person and i dont think i dont want keep pursuing this anymore id like to slowly walk away without hurting both of us she probably know im in love with her and shes playing me even if id come out and wed make things work quite impossible imho im not sure she might be a good fit sorry for language mistakes and for the format but im from mobile,3
it honestly amazes me how similarly horrific my social experience with the second degree was even though i knew the pitfalls and tried my best granted covid did happen as i started still dont know if it could have been different for me im bitter to say the least both times it was something like this first year i try to fit in but get all stressed out people reach out a little i either avoid it or get in the situation act awkward and get back to avoiding second year i get a nervous break down heavy paranoia and practically speak to nobody people stop reaching out third year i feel a little better in a who cares anyway kind of way i try to act like a normal person again but people make an effort not to even come in contact with me i feel like im still in quarantine not even alone but like actually hated by a bunch of people even though i practically dont exist to them,3
im not saying elliott had avpd but as an avpdsufferer i feel like the lyrics in this songs fits to a lot of whats going on in my life im constantly guarding myself against other peoples love your protection over their affection and basically alienating myself from them nobody broke your heart you broke your own cause you cant finish what you start,3
i made plans with a girl and we wanted to meet i decided to cancel it and i told her that i dont feel good obviously she asked what is trying to get me as a some physical illness but in reality depression is trying to get me i mean i really dont feel good i didnt lie its just not a physical illness what i am suprised is that she instantly also said that we can meet next week i thought she isnt interested and she is just messing with me thats also reason why i decided to cancel i dont think that my depression will be cured until then,3
thinking about dxxth a lot recently how do i stop,3
context when normal people interact with each other they speak and converse like they know eachother beforehand when they dont but im always quiet and just silently looking at them and like i know they notice it and sometimes they dont even want to interact because im so silent its like really hard to interact with when its about personal relationship but when i have appointments its easier extrovert normal idk what to call it,3
sometimes a song stops me in my tracks and this is one of themhttpsmyoutubecomwatchvwjxiuzvgjp my mother would tell me im exactly the same type of person as the lyrics of this song describe she called me a sociopath someone really sick in the head and not redeemable that i tried to purposely ruin my familys lives like i had a secret agenda that even i couldnt know about its been the foundation of all of my relationships with others and helps explain why i get so nervous trying to get close with anyone trying to connect while thinking im secretly extremely evil and unlovable and that im taking advantage of everyone just by wanting to talk with them that everything i say is actually calculated and manipulative despite me being unaware of this that my side of the story isnt just shameful and wrong its evil and vile avoidant with bpd is contradictory hell im hating closeness and trying to stay away but the other side of me is always getting too close in the relationships i can keep so they dont leave me im unbelievably stressed because im so close to disaster i hate to vent to my best friend of several years because i feel like im being too greedy of her time i feel like im sucking off all the meat of this relationship taking up the space for my troubles and then i dont even improve i know shes going to leave when she discovers im actually a terrible person and that i dont change i can feel it creeping towards me and i want to die i feel like shes only my friend because she falsely believes i have potential i feel like ive somehow manipulated her into thinking im a nice person i feel like im so much worse than she thinks i cant understand why someone would care about me other than they must be confused thinking of the wrong person i cant believe the situation im in it happens every single time and i never learn i get her texts saying i need to try to get help and i just want to sink into the ground and die i feel like ive done something really wrong and should stop talking to her the answer is simple stop avoiding therapy actually tell the therapist the truth everyone is sick of me including me,3
who here has hypochondria,3
is radiohead creep the anthem for avpd or is our problem so much more comes,3
i have had bad luck with therapists in the past but decided to try again i am mainly going to overcome a fear of driving i have driven before back as a teenager and the process was going well but there were some things that happened that then hindered it before in therapy i didnt have specific goals and i dont think that helped,3
maybe this isnt the best place to post this but literally why am i like this i couldve fucking died and im more scared of talking to people on the phone maybe id find it a little funny if it wasnt so pathetic arent normal people supposed to be more traumatized about the actual crashnear death experience meanwhile im over here basically having a panic attack over having to talk to people over the phone about it this is ridiculous,3
i have recently come across avpd and i realized that i relate to almost all of the symptoms first off im very anxious in almost all social situations this includes hanging around friends ive known for many many years being around extended family who ive also known for many years being around coworkers meeting new people and even just going grocery shopping i often try to avoid a lot of social situations which has definitely affected a lot of my relationships im not very close with my friends or family anymore i still hangout with them sometimes but its not on a very deep level i dont really open myself up to anyone im scared of people figuring out my true personality and that they wont like me for who i am i hide lots of parts of my personality and not one person on this earth truly knows me im close enough with my parents that i dont get anxious around them however i still hide many pieces of myself and dont feel comfortable enough to show everything about myself i have also struggled to find jobs that dont make me anxious it took me until i was years old until i finally got my first job because of this i currently work at a daycare and have worked here for about months and my anxiety has seemed to get worse i have been thinking about quitting for awhile now but am terrified of having the conversation with my boss about quitting whenever im at work i feel inferior to everyone else i feel like i have less experience i overthink everything and i am so awkward around my coworkers and parents i feel like im incompetent and people dont take me seriously because of my poor communication skills my mind often goes blank when im asked questions and i dont feel like im much of a help i also try to focus completely on the kids and i would rather not form any real relationships with other coworkers i try to keep conversations polite and small i rarely talk about myself either just enough to get by i play it safe ive always just felt like there was something wrong with me social anxiety kinda describes the way i feel but it seems like its more than just that,3
finally found the will to post here after years of lurking ive been living alone for all my adult years and i work from home i dont have any kind of social life and can easily spend several weeks without seeing or speaking to anyone i do have family but they all live far away and i dont see them often so sometimes i cant help but wonder what would happen if i ever have a stroke or a heart attack or if i fall down the stairs or if i choke on some food i often read about people being found dead in their home several years or even decades after they died and deep down im convinced thats how ill end up it really makes me feel scared and helpless and i dont know how to cope with it,3

does anybody else feel the need to fake yourself in front of others i pretend to be happy and not depressed because frankly no one likes a depressed person even i know that but beyond that its like i have no personality the only reason i can survive my office environment at work right now is because of an actual real and positive coworker she has the personality that i wish i had easy to talk to and very kind but shes leaving tomorrow so ive been faking my entire self happy smiling and trying to make conversation when all i really want to do is shut myself in my room what can i even do at this point how can i maintain a normal relationship without having to be the fakest person in the world,3
one thing im aware of is after youve been disconnected from societal norms for a few years it seems very difficult to return i tend to stay away from looking at other peoples lives overall it is good but you also need an awareness of how far adrift you are and the standard youre compared against the average person is socially active whereas were disengaged they have a constant stream of chores hobbies events plans messaging circles in a day some days i speak to no one and cant even find the motivation to do anything new even something like watching a movie i can put off my point is that after a while when you look at the activity level of a normal average person i just feel inadequate this is made worse reinforced by the fact that whenever i do try connect with others i get rejected thats because they can sense pretty early i have nothing going on for myself in these social areas and i am not so much like them and thats the catch because people excluding you stops you ever having anything im incapable of organising a fun life things like viewing someone in family gathering and getting along with large groups of people and creating a good impression are intimidatingnearly impossible for me im behind in career life experiences life skills energy its just difficult to even get a footing iv been cut away for so long and many types have closed the door on me,3
hi lovely community im quite new on this forum and just wondered if the origin of this is similar to what people refer to as an avoidant attachment style in which a lot of sources claim its due to neglect from parents in early childhood what triggers avpd or what is the kind of trauma that sparks it from what ive read so far its not something you are born with but rather develops with age please correct me if im wrong,3
ever since i started going to the gym i have fallen in love with it i look forward to it everyday as it completely distracts me from whatever it is i might be dealing with in my head i usually go in the evening and up until then im fine but i swear that drive back from the gym and when im sitting in my room all alone can be extremely excruciating sometimes the anxiety feels like a balloon going up and up into the sky eventually it will pop and come back down its just an awful feeling and i feel it almost every time now i wonder if anyone else has felt it or knows what im talking about its such a terribly lonely feeling i get i think what really bothers me more than anything in my life is this belief i have that i am not a good person i mean its not like im cussing people out or being a dick to anyone its more like i treat people like they dont matter or mean anything to me its an extremely shitty thing to do like i see a lot of the same people every day and i think normally this would result in you forming a bond with them slowly at least but its not like that everyone thats not in my immediate family just gets kept at arms length even then the relationships i do have with my family almost seem to be held up by plastic and tape,3
hey so ive made some realizations in the shower as i do what most of us do and plan out the conversations ill be having in two weeks because i know its going to happen and i need to be ready or ill just clam up and nothing is going to happen weve all been there most of us are still there lets talk about what im thinking about in this little vent sesh alright so i was showering thinking about how akward its going to be when i tell my friends some secrets wow i know sharing secrets it freaking sucks so basically im part of a church group and these people are closer to me than my family because i dont liketrust my family and being around them is stressful these friends that i hang out with all the time are my safe place and they make me feelhappy really though i dont share everything these people are genuine and kind and they always make me feel safe its just that i am going on a mission trip with them this summer going to africa and it took them months to convince me to come with them i still dont like the idea of going but knowing that ill be with them the entire time makes me feel much better besides i used to fly a lot so the plane ride will be pretty nostalgic for me so as part of going on the trip i have to do a few things one thing that i have to do is research a topic on one part of the trip and give a presentation to oir team people including me i trust love and feel safe with everyone on this team and all but one of them have been my closest friends for almost years now i couldnt ask for better friends anyways the presentation im giving is in two weeks and ill be discussing the entertainment part of the trip basically i just have to research what kind of entertainment there is where were going and make a small mostly funny slideshow it doesnt even have to last minutes but honestlythis presentation is the least of my anxieties in this mess another thing that im going to have to do is share my testimony that is essentially a summarized version of your life story ill have to talk about my troubles my past my family all of it and these are my friends theyll know if im holding back but it scares me so much half of them dont actually know i have avpd they just know that ive been going to therapy for a while and that i started taking medicine though the medicine is kind of iffy really anyways im super anxious about it especially since i did something similar last year but that was at the height of my emotional suppression this time last year i was so empty and emotionless but of course nobody knew i was always masking my emotions and faking a smile i didnt even know i was doing it and when i gave my testimony for last years mission it was incomplete and full of holes i talked about my lack of friends but i was blind to the emotional abuse and neglect from my parents and siblings because i had convinced myself that i was just weak and that my pain was normal and even less than what everyone else had to go through but its not like that thats not how i should think about my past pain it took so long for my friends to break my barriers but they managed to do that and convince me to go to therapy im much better now but im also not suppressing my emotions it was really hard at first because everything just hurt so much and it overwhelmed me one moment i was putting on a face to fool everyone into thinking i was okay but as soon as i was behind closed doors i was hurting myself and cursing the world for letting my life be the way it was the fact that i have to go and tell my friends how ive been feeling over the last year is overwhelming but i am not allowed to go on this mission unless i share my testimony its only fair though everyone of us is sharing our testimony no matter how much it hurts were going to be here for each other if youve actually read this far i just want to say thank you youre a special type of person and whoever is in your life is truly lucky to know someone like you and if they dont understand that then know that i am thanking you for the kindness you have done for me just by reading this thank you,3

this is an excerpt from the introduction of a book called on the outside looking in by daniela grazia about her experiences with social anxiety ive used it to describe my experiences to others but i have both social anxiety and avpd so i worry if im not explaining from the correct side im also a psychology student and find it interesting to try to distinguish the two i suppose it only matters in my head but it does matter the quote one long one formatting issues gtit is a feeling that comes over me often an old menace that stubbornly refuses to die in classes in coffee shops in almost any activity where surrounded by potential friends it is the profound feeling of alienness gtat any moment in the group conversation something in me snaps i look around the table at the other people blissfully talking and i do not feel like one of them i am not one of them i am different a foreigner an alien a stranger in a strange land gtand then the urge to run away to hide to be away from the people comes up sometimes i fight the urge and stay on hiding my vast discomfort other times i do run away cursing the cowardice and the shame miserable in my misanthropy but secure in my solitude gtthere is something in the faces in the voices of the others that i do not have they are into the conversation they live outside themselves i live inside myself they talk listen and laugh i think listen and smile gtthey are relaxed i am not i am never relaxed except when im alone solitude is the only place where i can ever truly be known gtyet i am not content with this for the real me is lonely desperately lonely longing for intimacy friendship and love i long to be able to relax to laugh to talk and converse amiably with other human beings but i cannot i idealize them in private and fear them in public gtfearfear drives the haunted mind fear tortures me gnaws at me and chases me from nearly everything i crave the most but not even fear can conquer the longing the desperate longing the aching striving for meaning in life for something other than the endless nights alone and unhugged the dreams unshared the life unnoticed gtwhen i am alone i wish i was other people when i am with other people i wish i was alone this contradiction is slowly but ruthlessly destroying my soul,3

i am years old and male i was diagnosed when i was ive also been diagnosed with bipolar disorder i live with my parents and i am neet i did not go to college ive spent the majority of my childhood and adolescence getting some kind of therapy andor psychiatric help but i stopped about a year ago because i realized it was not going to help me i have very low energy and fleeting motivation and day to day i cant consistently do the basic tasks of caring for myself and maintaining my living space in other words living like an actual adult the main reason these things are so hard for me is that when im doing chores and things where my mind can wander i keep thinking about things i dont want to think about i remember in detail the moments when people have insulted me or been cruel to me or times when ive embarassed myself or made a mistake for years and i relive them constantly and the wounds are continuously reopened and never heal i often freeze up when these thoughts strike me and sometimes it makes me curse or say things out loud when i know im alone sometimes these thoughts can be powerful enough to ruin a good mood and ruin my day it can make completing simple tasks so painful that i avoid them entirely and my quality of life suffers greatly and it affects the people that i live with i spend almost all of my time constantly trying to distract myself and escape from these thoughts can anyone relate how can i function like this,3

congratulations on making this invaluable observation you have successfully made it even more awkward for me now and these creatures exist in every fing party,3
sorry ill try to keep it relatively short im a yearold male and ive never been diagnosed with avpd but while reading about the symptoms a month ago things finally made sense to me why i act a certain way i thought i just had some kind of social anxiety when i went to therapy several years ago but ive felt that there has to be something else since i started feeling different in middle school ive avoided people responsibilites and have taken jobs where i can mostly avoid interpersonal communication i do still have close friends a great family and a girlfriend but i still have this urge to selfisolate and be alone however i do try to help people whenever asked and i try to do well at my workplace right now i have an opportunity to work longer at my current job and might even get a promotion years along the line in a position that i could basically hold for the rest of my working life but it would surely involve a lot more responsibilites speaking another language i dont know too well i live in a bilingual country where i speak the minority language a lot more and of course a ton more interpersonal communication ive searched and applied for other jobs recently because my current contract will expire in a few months im much more inclined to take a temp job for and a half year with something i like more and less interpersonal communication than a potential permanent job position it probably sounds crazy for most people if they heard this but this is genuinely how i feel i let my feelings of inadequacy and wanting to avoid people control me instead of doing something that could secure my future is this at all relatable,3
i have avpd and i am too afraid to ask for help even if i found the courage to find a therapist i am a minor so i would also have to tell my parents that just feels impossible do you guys have ideas of small steps i could take so i can work my way up to having the courage to get help i struggle with things like ordering food at restaurants so is there anything easier than that,3
where i am from everybody is on facebook that anxiety inducing place where i never feel safe and i feel hated invisible and dumb lately ive been spiralling and posted sad angsty posts to people who dont care about me thankfully i got only friends facebook made me feel more alone im disabled and i dont go outside and i struggle with texting i just dont get it i dont have the energy i kept deleting my posts feeling more ashamed i need it for something thats work related and still ongoing but enough i dont care if everyone is there i rather not feel like a burden and vent on reddit having a profile with my name and face while i am utterly depressed no thanks its not like i made any friends there i really hope that my issues will be resolved and i wont go back and make a fool outta myself because no one cares,3
i have always dreamed goal of mine to get away from my family and all people if i worked hard i could live by myself and never ever have any obligation to speak to another human being so long as i had my ducks in a row both financially and in general think ordering groceries and just leave it at the door tip well go away im getting older and i hate how much i keep needing to interact with people i dont have anyone in my life other than my parents but even they are on my last tiny nerves except weve been needing eachothers help a lot theyre old and need help im getting older and sometimes need help when im getting sick or life happens this flop era is turning into a flop lifetime im drained seeing people i just want to wake up day in my own place and hear complete and total silence never cross paths with another human being never make eye contact or play the dumb game of social interaction and just have enough stuff to get my needs met not even an escape i just want to exist solely,3
i just really came across with this term avoidant personality disorder on google by searching why do i want to be alone and live on my own away from others and i clicked on the very first article that came up i couldnt give much clearer description of myself after reading the article and so i looked it up on reddit and surprisingly a subreddit exists dedicated to this i desire to be alone and living on my own away from my family and people because i feel inhibited by them i feel like im restricted and couldnt act my true self when im with them maybe because im afraid of being disliked by them im not really sure and im still learning and knowing about myself am i the only one who feels this way,3
they only problem is they never get to know me because the only possible way they will is if i am forced to be in a situation with repeated exposure to them in which case i become familiar and slowly open up over the span of a week or two its downright disturbing how many times this has happened in my life and its depressing to think that those opportunities are few and far between now that im out of the primary environment they occur school i was so desperate at one point that despite having everything people normally strive for great career money success etc i thought about joining the army just to meet people holy shit what is wrong with me,3
hey all i was just diagnosed with avpd yesterday along with some other things and to be honest i still feel a little shell shocked im still learning more about the diagnoses obviously but i wanted to ask what tips or lessons the community has for a newbie like me what do you wish you knew when you were first diagnosed ive been working on overhauling my brain for a few years and i want to avoid falling into a trap where i just give up before i can fail as it is my tendency to do,3
disclaimer i dislike dating app culture in general theres a hell of a lot more to a person than a few pictures and prompts if im not attracted to someone then i wont swipe on them if i am attracted to someone and theres even one thing on their profile that i lack or dont relate to then i wont swipe on them either if theres someone im attracted to and theres nothing problematic in their profile i wont swipe on them because i doubt theyll be interested in me in the end this leaves a very very small pool of people which i guess makes the whole thing pointless,3
long story short i felt tired and anxious and wanted to go home and skip one class i didnt show up for this class in forever and didnt turn in much work so she was worried id procrastinate like i did in semester and fail when i said ill probably skip again she looked at me with so much disappointment and said i really should stop caring about people that much it didnt register then but it hits me now how hurt i am from her words it feels like im not doing good enough and i probably am not so that day i forced myself to sit through the class and even showed some progress to my professor but i cant get the look on her face out of my mind to be fair to her i said i needed to leave in a kinda joking manner because thats my coping mechanism so maybe she didnt think i felt as horrible as i did and thought i wanted to skip to avoid work,3
it was my birthday the other day and it was a bit depressing i spent it in the house eating a frozen pizza it was good though lol i didnt really do anything besides that and eating some cheesecake also good i was hurt that nobody wanted to celebrate with me besides my mom i dont have many friends besides a few online friends and lately i feel like theyre distancing themselves from me and i deal with rejection sensitivity and along with the avpd i feel like its all eating away at me when i see my friends talk to eachother or plan things without me it honestly hurts me and makes me want to cry my friend says everybody cares and loves me but in my avpd brain its not true and that they all would be happy if i was out of their lives to make this worse my therapist is moving soon and im scared i wont be able to find another therapist especially someone as nice and understanding as them she has helped me with a lot and im scared i wont be able to find someone as nice and supportive as her the last time i had a therapist who knew of my avpd they screamed at me and said i couldnt be helped this is all just making me feel hopelessly depressed and feeling rejected,3
im and have never gone to therapy or received any help and i really want to try it out but im so terrified of it and keep thinking things such as what if i misinterpret a question and answer wrong or that i will waste their time by not being completely truthful i very very rarely open up to anyone and when i do i have the sudden urge to cut off all contact with them which would obviously not be very useful with a therapist i did once apply for therapy for social anxiety but cancelled the process just as i got to the last step because i convinced myself i was faking it i want help and i dont want things to get worse but i dont know how to go about it any advice on how to overcome this fear or services available that i should start with im from the uk btw,3

hi all im new to this subreddit i was recently diagnosed with avpd im trying to understand it and come to terms with it the thing is i dont have social anxiety in terms of not wanting to spend time with people at all when its about folks i know like my colleagues and friends im even morethanaverage social however i do notice that im slow in social interactions i mean that someone will say something and my brain shuts down and i cant answer properly in the moment or i cant hear someone properly but im too afraid to ask them to repeat themselves so i just kinda freeze andor act as if i heard what they said and the conversation goes on then later i think of a correct reaction and cant for my life understand why i shut down during the convo and couldnt just think of this reaction then this happens with friends too although its more common with folks im not that comfortable with is this an avpd thing or just a me thing tldr is shutting down during conversations and only thinking of a proper reaction later an avpd thing,3
my brain is broken im incapable of creating and maintaining close relationships either out of some awkward selfconsciousness or fear thats pretty much all there is to it the fact that i seem pretty normalsmartathletic on the outside only makes things worse people have expectations for me socially and i obviously dont meet them so whats their conclusion hes weird something must be off about that guy how can he have all this stuff but be so strange theyll never understand i just want to experience life like they do lol im forever the empath that cant make a life with other people,3
hi there i have been depressed since i was years old i am now i also struggle with bpd social anxiety and avoidant personality disorder afraid to leave the house by myself reliant on my year old mother to pay my medical insurance and my husband is working full time barely keeping us afloat i have tried and tried to work several different fields even part time it always ended up in burn out and felt more depressed and anxious so i had to quit i am worried i feel my future is really hopeless i love my husband so much we wanted to have a family and its feeling like that wont happen because of my mental health and the low money thing i am afraid he will abandon me because of all this though deep down really dont feel like he will because he has been here through everything i know that is so much that is definitely something to be grateful for but we fight a good bit because were both so stressed out nothing really brings me happiness except substances and that leads to bad feelings when it wears off or sometimes when on them and ive been mostly sober for a year i see a therapist i take medications i just i am not content in life i am constantly worried about everything i constantly feel like im worthless and my husband deserves someone more stable that he doesnt essentially have to be a caregiver to at times i stay in bed about of my days because i feel like things are so hard to do and feel so pointless i dont have many friends and live in a small town so there arent any meetup groups or anything and since i dont work and am not in school no opportunities to make many friends i do have one so i can try to branch out with her friends maybe it feels like life is just about working and i feel so depressed by the state of everything and by my worries that things wont improve in the future things dont get better not if you dont work for them and i have worked ive tried so many treatments but the one thing i rarely do is go out in the world and i dont know if i can do that without a lot of help that i dont know if i can find please if you can relate at all or have any advice please please respond lt im desperate,3
i try to be an early bird and probably feel a bit more human when i am but its definitely more natural for me to be awake in the early hours of the morning and wake up later in the day thought it was worth asking to see whether most are night owls in an attempt to avoid life view pollhttpswwwredditcompollyhsd,3
i am turning in a month and a half and i suspect myself of having avpd i am trying to do more research on the disorder i am not going to self diagnose but i am hoping people who are diagnosed can tell me more about the traits and what its like having avpd,3
one problem i have with criticism and people offering it is that ive heard it already a lot from myself i think the worst things about myself to myself constantly the other night i told myself that im nothing more than potential the reason im lonely is because no one wants to wait around for me to finally decide to be a reality im walkingempty promises that encompasses a lot so when someone wants to tell me about myself it feels like a rerun and they hate that hate that they cant get their issue off or add their redundant nugget of truth idk if thats part of avpd and its coming off as arrogant its not the critiscm itself i dont mind more fuel for the fire its the attitude that erupts in response to me being unphased i always feel like im preparing myself for the worst possible things so im not as affected when they happen being one step ahead of anyone trying to hurt me sorry if this has been discussed im in and out a lot,3
its not like its hard for me to make friends but keeping them seems almost impossible i inevitably just stop messaging because it feels too difficult i hate that im like this because i desperately do need connection but i can never hold onto something once its there,3
ive spent so much of my life feeling like a complete freak who doesnt fit in anywhere its made me avoid social situations and relationships because im so terrified of someone realising im not normal and hating me for it then in turn missing out on those experiances amp relationships just makes me feel even more like an outcast who shouldnt exist ive tried on so many hats for why i feel like this social anxiety autism cptsd etc etc but they never fit right and i just feel so much more shame then i stumbled on an infographic about personality disorders looked up this sub and everything written here felt so familiar so much of my anxiety came from feeling like i was alone in my experiences so its so comforting knowing all of you are here and exist somewhere in the world i just wanted to say thank you all,3
so from what i have read seems like avpd is the only pure egodystonic personality disorder and usually personality disorders are seen as a flaw in someones personality and are egosyntonic in nature but in the case of avpd seems like no one likes to have this condition so why isnt avpd considered a mental illness because the symptoms of someone with avpd seems to match up with different things like social anxiety and extreme low self esteem like the symptoms are basically the same in a lot of ways,3
i met this guy on vacation and we hung out for two days at the pool im a very socially anxious person but with him i felt like id known him for years one night he told other teenagers that he liked me they told me and they were hyping me up saying stuff like oh look your boyfriends here i was so excited i never had a guy like me before i was bullied at school for being the quiet kid in class and i would run to my parents hoping theyd comfort me but theyd get mad at me for being so quiet and theyd blame me too i used to go up to my room at night and sing myself to sleep someday my prince will come now he was finally here so i went up to him and asked him if he liked me he told me he had a girlfriend and got mad at our friends for telling me he cut off contact with with me i was so sad that the one person who saw me for the good i have to offer still gave it up they broke up two months later and he looks at my social media were not in contact but according to my friend a playlist on his spotify was made as a birthday present to me but i dont forgive him im not angry at him for being loyal im angry at him for thrusting me into this situation im sure it wasnt easy for him but i was the one that suffered the greatest he got to choose between two girls his girlfriend is a victim too but at least he tried to make things okay with her and me i had no intention of getting in the way of a relationship i just thought i finally fell in love,3
it seems superficial almost but my severe acne is contributing a lot to my avoidant tendencies right now im doing everything in my power to treat it dermatologist prescription acne cream antibiotics clean bedding clean diet daily showers face wash etc it just seems to get worse every day and it is some of the worst ive seen im talking big red cysts at this point im convinced my lithium is causing it i was making decent progress too i was going to groups and started volunteering to get out of my house and around people again im trying to work up to going back to work but i just cant bring myself to keep volunteering looking like this if i go out of my comfort zone while constantly concerned about how i look and feeling gross i feel as though im doomed to fail if my mental state begins to slip it triggers my hyperhidrosis and then i pretty much have to bail im kind of just stuck in a period of regression after making some strides i dont know what to do it just feels hopeless between severe cystic acne and hyperhidrosis it is so fucking difficult to put myself into social situations its much safer to just hide away and wait it out but each day that passes is another day ive lost,3
i never let the ppl i talk to know this that would just be manipulative and rude but even if we been texting for years good friends and have been in a nonstop convo the past hours my heart still races when they take longer than usual to respond i think oh fuck i said something wrong i always say something wrong i cant ever say anything right im such a then theyll reply i chide myself for being so silly then do the same thing more times within the same conversation youd think being proven wrong so many times would fix it but no i always think ah this is the time i fucked up all the others were false alarms but ive really done it now rinse repeat,3
i cant market myself anymore i cant pretend that i have more going for me than i do i just cant,3
im always gonna be like this even with years of therapy and meds even while on copious amounts of confidence enhancing and anxiety reducing drugs im still too socially anxious and awkward sure i can force myself to socialise but i cant force myself to enjoy it or force myself to relax and just be myself the fact that this shit isnt getting any better no matter what i try is so demoralising it makes everything else pointless having severe avpdsocial anxiety really does infect every little area of your life i cant hold a job i cant make friends i havent talked to a girl in years never mind having a relationship my anxiety is so bad i get second hand anxiety watching people interact on a tv screen or hearing others use voice chat in video games and as i said sure i could force myself to get out there and maybe make friends or a gf but i cant force myself to enjoy being around them id be constantly stressed out tense unable to relax id have nothing in common with them i only ever feel comfortable alone living with a brain like this is like torture craving connections and feeling horribly lonely but being unable to actually make any connections or function in a social situation im technically an adult but i have no independence i still feel like a child and i know for a fact that if i keep on going my future is nothing but boring bleak and lonely whats the point of going to an awful stressful job everyday if my days off are just as bad my hobbies are just escapism i dont even enjoy anything anymore im just so tired i really dont see the point in going on when my brain is this fucked up and my future is inevitably empty and alone im barely in my s but im certain i wont make it to its so crazy how fucked up i am avpd is so awful it robs you of a basic human need but still leaves you with the desire for it a longing hunger that can never be sated the empty void inside my only gets bigger things are only getting worse no heartbreak or feeling of loss nothing to even look back on theres just nothing there has always been nothing my life is empty and always will be,3
ive always wondered if this is something avpd adjacent mushishi kinos journey spice and wolf girls last tour serial experiments lain they are not really related in any genre way but all feature some sort of disconnect with the mcs and the rest of the world its like youre just traveling through it and never really putting down roots but instead just observing for a while and then moving on they all sort of have this somber undertone that youre not really a part of the world and just experiencing small parts of it most of them feature a pair traveling together which makes it feel less lonely but mushishi only has the mc and thats the one that feels closest to avpd in a weird way in my mind does this make sense,3
i volunteer at a place that i like to help out at despite my debilitating anxiety because i like helping people plus itll help me gain credit for my future job but for a few days i didnt show up due to sickness now im supposed to text them when i dont show up my manager boss made that very clear she even gave me her personal email to text because she understood that i absolutely couldnt take phone calls due to anxiety now i may or may not have just skipped that part as id hate to bother them with a text plus its embarrassing so basically my school counselor who is in contact with my manager comes up to me and tells me that my manager was very upset and direct that i cant keep not notifying them when i cant go and i have one last chance or shed rather have me not help out at all this of course i soooo badly wanna say traumatized because it feels that way but ive experienced trauma before to know that this experience wasnt actually traumatic really hurt me all i wanted to do was help i just wanted to be useful to someone for once and all i did was end up being a burden i hate myself for this im scared to even go in again if i cant even hold a volenteer position im sure as hell arent ever going to be able to get a real job when i get older i fucking hate this disease its taking my life away,3
wanna preface this by saying that im not diagnosed nor do i selfdiagnose its just that i can relate to some of the symptoms and people here and im wondering if anyone can relate to my feelings i feel insane sometimes i feel really neurotic paranoid insecure and immature sometimes when i dont think about memories or people that upset me im fine these past few months ive been slowly recovering from this horrible depression thats plagued me for a while but in these past few days its been returning as i start thinking about these bad memories again i feel traumatized and like im a victim of something i cant understand like im alone in this pain the thing is that my trauma is really just a dozen or so bad interactions i had in my old circle of friends in particular there was this one person who i had a handful of unpleasant interactions with these were mostly brief exchanges that shouldnt have affected me as much as they did but they felt really sincerely resentful and unwarranted what did i do i didnt know how to stand up for myself and nobody did for me this person lashed out at me calling me insecure and afraid a couple of times and said some horrible things about people with my disability theyre ableist and honestly that group as a whole was too not out of malicious intent but ignorance this person wasnt wrong but the way they treated me didnt help seeing those criticisms mirrored by others a couple of times made me feel even more weak because i knew i was being talked about behind my back and when i did eventually see how this person talked about me behind my back it felt nasty and unwarranted still though it feels so fucking stupid man i dont know why i let this hurt me its been months since i stopped talking to those friends a few years since those bad exchanges occured and it still affects me i never met a person who exhibited such resentment for me in my life seemingly for no justifiable reason it really hurt my selfesteem and it still does when i think about those friends for too long i start to say things like i wanna die to myself like a tic its so stupid and i feel like a horrible person for this for feeling such disproportionate hurt over a dozen or so bad memories when i dont think about this stuff i begin to feel more normal again though sorry that this is so long but im just wondering if anyone can relate if not sorry for wasting your time i hope this isnt considered offtopic since im undiagnosed but yeah i feel really pathetic about this side of myself maybe im just highly neurotic i dont know i just wish i could understand whats wrong with me,3

i often fantasize comitting suicide its bad but i feel this is only way out all my life since i was a little ive been incredibly distressed and downtrodden and broken inside been longing for a break from all the misery but it has never occurred the only thing thats keeping me a little hopeful is telling myself that everything has an end what i experience has an end whether my life will improve or simply just die either way i welcome it,3
trigger warning mention of eating disorders and suicide a month ago my brother was talking about how he just turned he was saying how he didnt look and he pointed to me and said he looks older than me im it felt like a stab in my heart ever since ive barely left the house i wasnt trying to date before that but now im not even going to try i feel suicidal now and i dont feel like lifes worth living im old looking for my age so i should just give up that comment is running through my mind its torture i feel so embarrassed if my brother knew what that comment did to me it would suck im so angry but hurts its not really his fault how i feel but why did he say that ive struggled with eating disorders my whole life i get anxious seeing my brother because im scared of what he will say everything reminds me of that comment i have barely been eating it just reminded me why i shouldnt leave the house because other people will think the same it feels like such a stupid reason to be suicidal over but its taking every bit of my energy not to do it everyday how am i meant to go through life if a silly comment like that has gotten me like this how do i get over it im not strong enough to go through life,3
i dont feel like putting in the work anymore i know some of you will say no one will save you you have to save yourself but thats just not true i have saved three people i called friends before from terrible terrible things but i dont know if anyone will want to save me i dont have any energy within myself to give out anymore i dont have any resources material or otherwise to give anymore in short i dont think im profitable enough to be helped anymore id lose you more money than id make you,3

an article i wanted to share with you all to read thought it might bring more awareness for yall especially for the ones who are unofficially diagnosed and highly suspect they may have it although i have enough clarity to know i have it undiagnosed this is hands down the best breakdown and description of each possible symptoms that come with it never heard it like this before its not like your typical dsm avpd symptoms that are more generalized and broad this is more in depth and even more eye opening since i resonate so much with all of them im so bored just wanted to share something heres the link to it httpsavoidantsorgsymptomsofavoidantpersonality,3
hi yearold male with avpd here for some time i have noticed that contacts with other people in my case only at work began to bring me pleasure ive also become more relaxed and when im around people i dont worry as much about how they react to what i say at the same time a desire for more close relationhips arosed in me this desire applies both to finding a partner and friends i just want as real as never before in my life a simple conversation with another person and intimacy however i dont know how to achieve this ive finished my education and i dont have any social hobbies the gym can be considered as such but i still cant find a way to start naturally a conversation with other people there im starting to get annoyed with this situation because certainly something has changed in my attiude and i truly want to form some relationships outside of my work environment i think im ready to get out of my comfort zone step by step but i dont know how to do it one way to do it is to start dating finding a partner is something that i want very strongly and i think love is something im capable of the thing thats holding me back from making that move though other than well the lack of photos to use on dating apps is knowing that ill be too much of a burden for her not having other relationships perhaps there is also an element of shame in not having any friends i am not sure have any of you reached such a point on your journey to normality im not sure if im overanalyzing everything and if i shouldnt just do what i feel regardless of my doubts in my case finding friends seems to be something more distant at the moment and i dont know how i could achieve it however i will be grateful for every piece od advice,3
not sure if its an avpd thing but growing up i told a string of lies to all of my very few friends it weighs on me almost daily some were really horrible like going blind by or refusing to help my cousin during an overdose as a child of course thats not real i cant believe i said those things to people but it felt like the only way at the time through a lot of reflection i realized that i expected rejection and wanted to control it i wanted to make them see me as a bad person because i didnt deserve them but nothing in my life that i understood at the time was damaging enough to cause these problems my family taught to me early on that if youre not doing hard drugs or jumping off the bridge its not a valid mental health condition i didnt think i had any reason to have the problems i did so i had to give people fake reasons to make them believe it because my parents told me thats the only way also somewhat of a test like if they stay for this horrible person im pretending to be theyll surely stick around for who i actually am if thats better and its not hard to be better than that given the severity of the lies i told if they leave then ill have been in control of the rejection and theyre not reacting to the true me anyway so the judgement doesnt hurt as badly avoiding the spotlight by pretending to be another person,3
my mom is a very caring and emotional person and shes never been mean or rude in any way however she never believes me when i say that to her shes struggling with loving herself and believes that no one loves her and can help her and because of that she has resorted to drinking because of her disorders she constantly bullies herself every day on everything she does and thinks shes the worst person alive shes very sensitive too so one little thing can ruin her day and cause her to drink my parents are separated but theyre both on good terms and still talk on top of that im struggling with myself too and i think im stressing her out im only so what can i do to help her she tried many antidepressants and other treatments but said that none works compliments doesnt work either since she never believes me i always worry shes going to do something bad to herself one day,3
hey all i was diagnosed with avpd quite recently and finally i guess after all those years spent in confusion what is wrong with me i finally got an appointment at psychologist we were doing for the first few hours screening process turned out i do have avpd and i met all necessary criteria for being diagnosed with bpd also he mentioned that i do have some symptoms of schizophrenia and narcissistic personality but after i read his diagnosis this evening he wrote that i have other personality disorder which idk how i feel about that like i do not belong to anything even in this and when i started to talk to him about feeling really depressed and about my suicidal thoughts earlier today he just said that we will talk about it next time in a two weeks and i am so confused about this like no one really care especially with the suicidal thoughts and feeling i do have no one to talk or maybe i dont want to i dont know but this is making me super super lonely and more depressed no one really cares,3

i have a few university exams coming up that im not comfortable with taking and have no confidence of doing well in i dont want to do them and the thought of preparing for them is absolutely exhausting partly because i feel like i have a lot to learn and even starting is hard i just cant face it so with that in mind im just avoiding my life and throwing myself into relentless scrolling on the likes of reddit and watching youtube videos and basically becoming a robot ill probably cram in a load of information and ruin my sleep in the build up to the exam after wasting all this time i dont know if its a defence mechanism preparing for failure or what but its fucking debilitating and im tired of it,3
i completely shut off due to my anxiety and depression its hard to not avoid avoid avoid and feel like a burden especially when you have people you love and know care about you my heart and mind conflict so much because im so sensitive and ive just built a wall after years of negative feelings and rejections but my heart wants the exact opposite and i get so lonely dealing with depression alone wondering why do i have to deal with this all the time but it hurts the most to be going through it and hurt the people you really love like i dont want to be a burden anymore but its easy to feed the demons that are telling you to avoid avoid avoid and the fear i know other people are going through things too and im not good enough to even be there for them,3

as someone with avpd i dont date much and i just want someone who will be loyal to me its very clear that hes attracted to me im attracted to him too but everyone says that im way too pretty for him about two weeks into us knowing each other he shared a really intimate story of a traumatic experience that happened to him hes a empathetic person that cares for other people but he gets angry over minor things im sure hes gone to therapy because even though he will explode at the most random times therell be other times when hes really good at conflict resolution before we dated i invited him to my birthday party supposedly a few weeks before he was flirting with me but i didnt pick up on it so when i invited him it confused him he thought i was giving him mixed signals on his twitter that i dont follow he was saying stuff like playing with peoples feelings is bad and disloyal people annoy me the next several weeks he gave me the cold shoulder and really did not want to talk to me hell also roll his eyes or grunt over relatively things that really arent a big deal sometimes i wonder if the thing that i did even warranted a sigh or eye roll im just wondering if i got into a relationship with him would it get worse view pollhttpswwwredditcompollwbhk,3
i guess i have multiple friends but ive only ever thought of of them as close friends the rest i dont really talk to a lot but i try so hard to connect with them and get closer to them but it just feels weird and forced and i can clearly tell that its unreciprocated it just makes me want to give up and now im starting to realize that with even one of my closest friends we may not even actually be as close as i thought we were we rarely if ever talk and when we do its usually just short convos or in a group chat and im always the one that has to initiate conversations i think im lucky if i ever get to have one genuine conversation with them once a month it just kinda hurts to think about i guess why cant i connect with people why is it so difficult all of my life ive avoided people and just wanted to do my own thing and the moment i try building meaningful connections with people they all fail,3
as someone with avpd i have trouble connecting with people i know im smart and attractive and i care for people but its my lack of social skills that make it hard for people to see the real me ive had two guys like me back in the past few years which one of them would be considered my first love the first guy dave i met when i was on vacation he and i would just talk at the pool about politics and education even though he was kind of a party guy he has a nerdy side we only hung out for two days but after our first day hanging out the second day he was really shy talking to me but our romance was cut short because he had a girlfriend and made the mistake of spilling the beans about his crush on me to other kids at the resort he cut off contact with me but when they broke up a month later he started looking at my social media a lot not to mention he made a playlist about me for my birthday we dont even talk so i dont know if this is some sort of peace offering or apology the second guy steve i met a year later at my job he and i bonded on the first day of work about growing up in the same hometown and i told my mom that day about how we bonded over our parallel lives we worked together for a little over a year and we never went out or anything but he would hit on me a lot but stupid me was either too dense to realize he was flirting or too surprised in the moment to say any good flirting lines back but a customer asked me for my number one day and i gave it to him i guess i kind of wanted to motivate my crush to ask me out but literally the week after he went out with his sisters friend the sister set them up but they broke up and he likes me view pollhttpswwwredditcompollwpn,3

went out with an old friend for her birthday in a city two hours away from where i live things were going well but im getting the feeling i annoyed everyone and no one wants to hear my voice anymore i cant excuse myself and go home and i also feel rude saying im going to bed first im the only single person here and theres so many years of bonding and inside jokes ive missed out on you know when at the beginning of the night everyone seems happy to see you and laughs at your comments if youre your lucky but then everyone slowly stops replying to you and distancing themselves from you as the night goes on i also got overstimulated and frustrated very briefly not at anyone in particular but now i just feel like i overstayer my welcome im stuck here until tomorrow morning when we go home and i have no one to talk to because this girl i came with is my only friend i feel like shrinking and making everyone forget i was ever here,3
im not great at connecting with people i understand social cues but i guess people find me weird or whatever i will be there for people but they will say things like they feel like they have nobdoy to talk to and it makes me feel like im not good enough for them or the the type of friend they had in mind it sucks but what can you do,3
i thought it was depression but maybe the nonstop hypervigilance is really the one doing it does anything help,3
usually i am a secretive person but if i start talking about myself i almost always go into unneccessary details,3
im a below average looking guy and i just want to be normal looking i feel like my avpd has gotten worse over time because i am just too ugly for life,3
sometimes i cant believe im in this situation lol its like a nightmare you know nothing is gonna change even if you cure this sickness because you are ugly and getting excluded is a natural procces for you edit posting something like this was a miskate looks like when you are an ugly man you cant talk about your problems and when you do people tell you its all your fault and you have a shitty personality you cannot say the opposite otherwise you will get downvoted to the bottom thanks to our helpful users here today i learned im a sexist schizophrenic guy who has some personality issues and treats other people like shiteven tho they dont talk to me for more than seconds,3
im a very introspective person i always observe my actions and thoughts and how i interact with other people i can see ive got a negative feedback loop with sad avpd and autism traits which destroys my self esteem which means i always have bad intentions and conversations with people but im just so confused and leaves me feeling hopeless as i have no idea how to change,3
tw lightly suicidal this week i have to begin fixing my life i dont have a choice in the matter i will need to see a new psychiatrist and a new therapist i need to get a job i need to eat i have so much to do to fix myself before i can even start with the basics of life and worst of all i have to be honest to heal im not even honest with myself i just smile and nod to everyone no one takes me seriously because im always laughing and joking i cant turn it off like when your parents say keep making that face and itll stick that way forever i got my face stuck in a clown mask i feel like a shriveled dehydrated soul like a sewer rat crawling out of the soggy drain im horrifically depressed the worst of my life and honestly the effort just doesnt feel worth it id really rather just rot and die im so terrified of all this id prefer to die but i couldnt make that choice either i am trapped on all sides,3
i dont believe in matters of mental health ever truly being cured even though i still have some avpd traits that im still working on my therapist says i certainly no longer meet the diagnosis of avpd ive gone from being a textbook avpd with such bad social anxiety i barely left the house an could barely order a cheeseburger all through school people called me socially retarded and my mom thought i was autistic to now being a very socially skilled confident outgoing person who makes friends easily im curious if people are interested in some kind of a write up about how ive recovered from my avpd what helped me how long it can take etc i see a lot of people struggling and feeling hopeless on this board it breaks my heart when i see people truly believe that recovery is impossible and spreading that false message it is possible its just really hard uncomfortable takes a lot of time and you have to really want it thoughts on whether a write up is something people would be receptive of im also open to suggestions of what else could help ps i feel vulnerable writing this post in fear that people will have an angry skeptical reaction or think im being narcissistic but i wanted to take the risk and reach out anyway because im super passionate about recovery and id love to see the negative narrative about avpd recovery start to change,3
so this is actually something really positive for me even if it isnt considered the best thing in everyones minds i was going to the bathroom and i was wearing a really baggy hoodie with pants that are way too big for me these days the pants used to fit me just fine but ive lost so much weight that i have to tie them around my waist or theyll just fall off anyways what im getting at is i saw myself in the mirror when i walked in and i couldnt help but think that i look exactly how i want to look i love how comfy clothes look my hair is long and messy and i guess im in a good enough state of mind to see myself as cute when my hair covers my face like it did i am embarrassed that as a guy i like feeling cute but i think its great and ive been told that it actually makes me more attractive but when i was admiring myself in the mirror i lifted up my hoodie no i dont wear a shirt underneath my hoodies the temperature much too hot for that as i can barely wear this hoodie and i saw that my waist was super skinny of course i dont eat much and i still function fine so i guess thats okay what im getting at is i was able to look at myself in the mirror today and i liked what i saw and people can think what they want i look exactly how i want to look today and i love that things have really been getting better for me and though theres still plenty of low points i can easily see my condition is getting better i hope everyone else is doing okay and i hope that by sharing this i can bring some hope to anyone else who has been struggling with this pd thank yall if you read this far and i hope youre doing well,3
dae experience this no one takes me seriously when i say that stuff thats happened to me has negatively affected my mental health im basically told to calm down stop worrying even if its really affected me basically just a refusal to accept and acknowledge that ive been hurt i think is partly why i have avpd to start with i guess this could be classed as some form of emotional neglect not having my feelings validated or taken seriously to the point where ive had to deal with my trauma by myself,3

hello lovely community im reading a lot about this mainly to understand the guy im dating better who has avpd my lovely community please help me understand why it takes often over hours to respond to a text from your loved ones is there specific content that triggers you to avoid replying ie expression of feelings yet i hear that the avpd community does enjoy getting reassurance sometimes it makes me feel like theres a lack of interest but i often end up getting a reply after all just days late but its confusing to determine wether you are disinterested or just afraid to answer love to hear your thoughtsexperiences,3
i put up so many masks around everybody i show some parts of myself to some people and other parts to other people and some parts i never show anybody and probably never will nobody in my life has ever truly known me they only know the person ive shown them its exhausting but its basically second nature at this point and i literally dont know how to be anything else i find myself telling so many little lies even about the most mundane things about myself and i dont even mean to do it on purpose my opinions are always what i think the other person wants to hear every word i say and everything i show on the surface is always a watered down version of what i truly want to say and feel even when im just in the car with someone i only play music i think they would like or what i want them to think i listen to most of the time i dont even know what parts of myself are true or not im like a puzzle made up of completely different pieces that dont fit together its all just so fucked i dont know how to fix this i wish there was someone who could see through all these masks and help bring out who i actually am but i dont even know if thats possible at this point,3
im in my s now the last time i had friends was in school im not sure we would have been friends if the we hadnt been in the same environment day after day actually im pretty sure we wouldnt have been my friends mostly were other people who didnt have other friends ie other outsiders wed meet to play computer games or sometimes rarely go swimming but we never really talked about personal stuff im not even sure this counts as friendship anywayso ive been without that kind of social connection for a long time now too busy struggling with education and work and health and life in general to engage in hobbies i think i really have no idea what friendship is apart from seeing it on tv or remembering childhood friends is it more than spending time together and watching tv or engaging in hobbies together am i even capable of friendship consequently friendship isnt something ive been looking for maybe if i knew what im missing out on i would im about to embark on a psychotherapy journey again and i feel unprepared what do i even want,3
i used to be quite eloquent when i was younger despite not talking to anyone i always had the right word or description for what i intended to say if only i wasnt an asshole and actually practiced conversation not sure where it all started to escape me could be when my mental health went downhill or when i got off my meds or when i got high almost every day for a year but nowadays its not uncommon for me to struggle to write simple sentences sending an email or text takes me way longer than it should it really interferes when im trying to talk with others so often i feel like i know what i want to say but the words are just out of reach and instead of adding to the conversation im just like yeah uuuh i feel you,3
this week has been absolute hell i feel so overwhelmed with life right now and i want to be completely alone i dont want to be perceived or asked why i missed two weeks of class i dont want people constantly and very publicly asking me if im okay yes im fine but no im not fine im fine enough to function but i also want to run away i appreciate the sentiment i just wish it wasnt in front of the whole class im pretty sure most of this is my depression talking but its definitely making my avpd symptoms worse i feel like everybody is looking at me im beating myself up all the time for what i dontcant do i feel like everyone hates me i hate myself i just want to hide curl up into my corner never speak to a soul,3

so i just started supplement license beside my real licensehope its understandable we have to drive some lesson and i was with a new driving instructor finished my lesson and he gave me some tips one of them was i dont need to be a mouse at this point i just felt insulted why is there always a expectation to be talkative yeah im gonna drive people around most elderly but im gonna try as much i can im seriously tired of society always expecting everyone to be bubbly and talk constantly,3
i have had a partner for years its a shock to me as well but we havent had the greatest past to make a very long story short when he started medical school years ago when we first started dating he wasnt that nice to me some might say he was abusive towards me especially when he drank anyway he used my avoidant personality as leverage to skew many details regarding our relationship it turned everyone in his life against me now my partner has sobered up it took me a while to trust and accept this change but the people in his life still havent let go of the past and the truth is neither have i ive forgiven my partner but i havent forgotten how everyone else treated me even after my partner tried to clear my name it only augmented the characteristics of my avpd it dissuaded me from applying to grad school seek any professional or academic opportunities but mainly it left me with an intense fear of leaving my house because i simply dont trust anyone anymore today my partner found out where he matched for residency his school hosted a luncheon that celebrated the students who matched so my partner invited me and his parents and his friends were already there since theyre in the same class keep in mind that i havent seen anyone in about years after panicking for a week before the event i finally mustered up the courage to go i convinced myself its not going to be bad my partner actually reassured me a lot as well well aside from my partner everyone acted like i was invisible they went out of their way to hug and greet everyone and then skipped right over me even when i spoke they wouldnt acknowledge me my partner was really disappointed in them but wanted to keep the mood light so he didnt confront anyone he did stick by my side so i was at least grateful for that it all just augmented my social anxiety avoidant personality and even my body dysmorphia looking at the pictures i took of everyone else versus the photos they took of me im really struggling to decide if its just a bad day or if im really that hideous it makes me never want to step foot outside again my partner truly has turned his life around and has become more aware of my needs i love him very much and am proud that hes grown up a lot during our relationship yes ideally we wouldve never had to go through our dark phase but hes helped me in many ways too i just wish the people in his life were nicer to me they have no idea what their rejection does to me,3
ive been diagnosed having bpd borderline personality disorder years ago when i was since then my life have been a living hell however last year and a half ive felt like my symptoms have changed a lot though i still have all the bpd symptoms some symptoms like avoidance social anxiety isolation feeling less came up from nowhere for matter of fact i stopped talking to all my friends stopped working going out date i stopped living this winter i didnt go out of my appartement and if it wasnt for my mother i would probably have died of hunger going out doesnt scare me people outside does i feel like they all stare at me and they know how shitty i am i feel like im not like them and whatever i do im not enough even open the shutters is a damn burden sometimes i think i might be paranoid but i dont think people want me any harm nor i feel persecuted im just ashamed of myself i dont know if i have avpd or just social anxiety but its a fucking misery is there anyone if this situation,3
not because they are doing something suspicious but because they dont want their preferences or choices to be seen i have the option to watch youtube on a smart tv but instead i watch it on a tiny little phone screen with earphones when im in company because i dont want anyone to see my web or streaming history even if its something as innocuous as looking up a recipe or reading an online news article i just feel so much fear of someone looking at my internet history although its generally harmless and boring crap i remember being years old and my brother being angry at me because i would turn off the tv and act all shifty when he walked into the room when i was a child i would hide my drawings from my parents and classmates because i would be so embarrassed that was my first sign of avpd i was eventually diagnosed at and again by another psychologist at,3
anyone else ever feel slow to catch on to things new show comes out new game comes out new trend im always late to it all i always find myself saying the phrase thats a thing when people bring up things i genuinely never heard of but apparently everyone else has i seem to have a general lack of interest in exploring anything in my life if is i hate it and is i love this and will skip sleep to do it the highest i can get is like a even with the things i love which sucks because often times people bond thru shared hobbies but you have to be passionate enough about that said hobby to actually fit in and often times im just not that into it as the people around me one simple example is when i tried playing dnd it just made me uncomfortable because everyone was so into it and i wanted to be as well but idk it felt like there was this barrier between me and having fun and i get that it might not be my cup of tea but like this happens with everything i try or when i was considering my major for school i ended up picking something that i had just heard was a highly paid major without really thinking about it at all i didnt bother to look into what classes i would be taking what jobs it would train me for hell whether or not i even liked it it was just ok sounds good one of the most important decisions of my life made in minutes and now senior year im regretting it heavily and feel like switching to another career makes me think about how many opportunities ive missed out on simply for being too average and opinionless in life idk im asking on this sub mostly because im curious if this is related to avpd or not or if its more a personality thing,3
for a long time all i wanted is to be loved by other people but as a depressed individual its been kinda impossible to believe anyone will ever love me and i dont even mean it exclusively in the romantic sense how does a first kiss feel i dont even know but in the platonic sense too i dont even think im physically unattractive but i do know my personality is unattractive which is somehow worse with this i am not saying i am unworthy of love i mean that my goals in life and my way of being is not what its expected of people nowadays i have weird and extremely niche interests i am weird and my only purpose in life is to collect the biggest spectrum of unique experiencies definitely not the kind of people that attracts other people in this world i mean ambitious people with dreams of financial gains charismatic people etcetera dont get me wrong i love my weird quirky self but so far nobody has ever loved my weird quirky self lol i know theres lots of people in this big and wide planet but it seems like i dont have the skills to find the people who will like me the people who will form groups with me the people who will desire me in a romantic way and considering my age i feel like its too late to find those skills the skills of making deep meaningful reciprocal connections with other people but i think thats okay somehow getting rid of the desire to form connections with others has made me happier with those smalltalk friendships whom only talk to me about the weather or their job with those classmates who only talk to me when i awkwardly join the bigger groups at college maybe thinking that im worthy to be loved by other people is me asking too much the approach im taking now is to love myself and with love i mean romantic love i flirt with myself i tell myself im beautiful even if i dont recognize that person in the mirror as someone beautiful i have lots of love buried in my heart and i always waited to get into a relationship to give this love to someone else now i try to give it to my own self theres days when i really want to die and i cant even get out of bed and i ask myself what would i do if the love of my life felt like this and i realize that i would support her i would do everything to get her out of bed help her bath and make some food for her so i get out of bed i bathe myself and make myself some food theres some days when loneliness hurts though i always see stories of the beauty of romantic love of touching the lips of the person you would die for feeling that persons chest and not caring if the world ends as long as youre on their arms stories of the joy of hanging out with likeminded people and just being up at am enjoying each others presence and looking at the stars together these are experiences i will never live and it hurts and it makes me feel like this whole philosophy i just described in this post is just a dangerous coping mechanism but what would i do if the love of my life felt like this i would hug them and tell them that its gonna be okay so i just tell myself that im gonna be okay you think you might find community a sense of connection to something bigger but you dont in fact you feel more alone than you did before you left but you survive you learn that you can survive being alone bojack horseman,3
i feel exhausted from the constant voices in my head and my heart racing during social situations i feel like everything i do could have been done better and that i am inadequate my avoidance is getting worse to the point where i am unable to do anything at all as a medical student i chose to study this major without truly understanding the challenges that would come with it now during my clinical rotations every encounter with each patient feels like a nightmare i constantly feel judged and i fear harsh criticism is always one step away from being directed at me this constant mental battle leaves me with no room to use the knowledge that i have worked so hard to achieve i am always reserved and quiet and i do not act on anything until i know there is no other option fearing that i will be blamed for my incompetence however this has backfired on me as i struggle to form connections and networks losing out on many opportunities in my field that could improve my social and financial status gradually people have started to label me as arrogant or irresponsible which makes me feel hopeless what can i do to sustain balance at least in my mind in addition to this i am lonely and the effect on my alreadydamaged mental health is apparent last year i met a group of people with whom i shared similar interests socializing with them was enjoyable and i felt liked but in my efforts to get closer to them and belong to the friend group i ended up stressing over whether i was making them uncomfortable whether i had anything interesting to say and whether they looked down on me the gutwrenching anxiety became too much to bear and i ended up quitting i limited my texts and stopped going to meetings though i am still in contact with them on social media i see how new people have joined the group formed close friendships and i continue to feel like a familiar stranger to all of them i am preparing myself to accept the lack of romantic intimacy in my life though i have always been indifferent about relationships sometimes i think that i am going to miss out on so many ordinary but enjoyable experiences in life there were guys who took an interest in me because i had this mysterious aura around me but after a few more dates i was still the same person they met on the first day i had nothing more to offer other than shallow and unimportant conversations every time i wanted to go deeper i felt exposed and vulnerable like prey so its definitive for me that i have to completely abandon this part of my life and move on im sorry if i went on for too long or sounded negative but i really needed to share my thoughts and emotions with those who can understand thank you for taking the time to read this post,3
so ive been a nanny for about years now daycare before that and one of the best parts of the job was extremely minimal adult interaction id go to work one of the parents would tell me what i needed to know and then went to work when they got back in the evening wed say goodnight and that was it since covid however at least one of the parents works from home i currently work for a family with both parents work from home its terrible i jump at every noise that might mean they are coming to say hi to their kid i worry so much about where they are what they think theyre hearing when i talk to their baby my appearance the way i dress i imagine theyre mocking the way i sneeze or theyre disgusted by my weight gain i am very good at my job but my anxiety is so distracting it makes everything so much harder i cant tell you how many times ive tossed my phone across the room when i hear footsteps coming because even if i am only looking up the weather or craft ideas im terrified theyll think im on the phone all day,3
lately ive been reading more about bpd particularly silent bpd and i check off every symptom on the list im wondering if its a common thing for these two conditions to be related as it seems that this combo could be incredibly self destructiveas i am and hectic thoughts,3
i am not diagnosed with avpd i think i have it but i wont say i have it ive shown a lot of symptoms since childhood im and usually they diagnose people who are older so yea idk ive posted on here several times and feel such a comfort with all the people who relate ive lost friendships because of how i am its so nice to feel understood and to connect with other people like me i dont know where else to go to vent so i usually go here all the people who comment really make me feel better since they get it,3
im planning on doing a certain diploma you need to do at least six months of internship for i shouldve started applying for those weeks ago but ive been avoiding it because i feel like id either end up not getting the internship or trick them into thinking ill be a valuable addition to their institution which i dont think i would be so essentially ive been doing self sabotage now the problem is that ive had quite a lot of absences at school the teachers all know about some of my mental illnesses and have suffered because of it ill need references for the application process i dont have anyone else to do that other than my teachers but i feel that asking anyone to do it would be putting them in a really hard position because they dont want to lie to an institution about me being a valuable addition when they think they know ill only mess things up honestly i just feel like even if i end up getting an internship somehow would be a miracle in the first place id somehow find a way to burn out and mess up once again if i dont go for this diploma ill essentially have wasted four years of my life and i dont think my chronically depressed self could recover from that any advice,3
i am so goddamn tired of everything i am not looking forward to anything have no goalsjust a lowpaid job that i dont really like i guess i can be proud that i got one in the first place despite how horribly painful that was to get used to it and my thoughts about quitting it after first week but honestly other than that i have no clue why i am doing all this i mean everythinggoing to job eating trying to do somethingliving i am so tired i barely drag my body to work or practically anywhere about my jobi got more or less used to it but i still feel like my coworkers hate me its my avpd brain acting up again goddamn pesky little thing theyre nice to me but this irrational part of me wins every time every day is a misery and i am so tired i always tell myself that i have to go forward and dont stop but by now i am not sure why or where i am going feels like i am just aimlessly wandering around in the darkness with no clue whatsoever,3
im a highly sensitive person or hsp but i realized i was being super sensitive for awhile now i think this is when i started to realize my avpd i was talking to my former therapist a couple of months back and she told me about it her friend had become disabled and was being hypersensitive i think a lot of this comes from trauma also doesnt help when people arent really compassionate in general i dont really have much advice but try to heal from traumas ive been doing that alot more lately it took a really long time but i feel less stuck now,3
when people get to know me im actually very loud almost obnoxiously loud as in id be embarrassed if i acted that way around random people and i sometimes wonder if im avoidant because of the fact that deep down im just an obnoxiously loud person and somehow ive decided being avoidant keeps my life easier less drama no risk of annoying people but then i also wonder if maybe in reality im just loud sometimes to make up for the way too many times ive kept everything inside idk but that leads me to another question how can you truly heal from your problems when it would require getting rid of coping mechanisms held in place all your life i should add im generally a very quiet person,3
i was told to phone call someone but i cant even make myself im literally about to tell them im incapable of talking to people and make myself even more pathetic wtf should i do they will just tell me meaningless things for an hour which i have no solution tomy phobia is getting worse and worse im also starting to have some anger outbursts which rarely happen but i think i will snap and it is not even that big of deal,3
sometimes i forget im good at things it helps me to remember what ones since theres so much i feel like im not good at im more than what im not naturally good at im very naturally flexible so yoga is easy for me extremely resourceful i feel like i can make anything out of anything great at literary analysis a good cook i dont easily give up when something is difficult good at understanding amp applying new concepts easily good at drawing amp art good at trying new things if theyre not too overwhelming empathetic and nonjudgmental despite what my face and energy are giving off lol good taste in books fashion films etc good at giftgiving what about you all,3
for me its difficult because everyone is more advanced than me or younger many people are focused on careersproductivityschoolfamily i always feel like a kid compared to others when i observe or interact with people another issue that would happen is the few people i found remotely on my level would ditch me after some months i think it does not work with people if you do not objectively help the person or intend to interact with them on a physical or visceral level rather than just talking about interests or random stuff in theory i should just go ask people if they want to play certain games but it does not feel right if people just opening up about their personal lives or bantering with me makes me feel like trash it is absurd to me that i have to shut out x percent of the population because they are better than me or i dont share their interests,3
i find myself abandoning reddit accounts and making new ones every few weeks or so i hate the fact that reddit leaves a trail of evidence about me that i cant hide from people and make my comments and questions private i hate the whole karma and upvotesdownvotes thing i like reddit for the simple fact that there are communities here for just about everything that i dont have access to otherwise i also use facebook groups but i have an account with a fake name and no information on the profile if i have commented too much in a single group and people start recognizing me i usually change my name on facebook you are usually allowed to change your name on facebook several times a year or so i just hate the fact that i am seen and i have built a persona either online or offline i just wish i could be invisible or anonymous everywhere i went including online i also hate people knowing what country i was born in because most people are from the united states and it makes me stand out so i try and use american terms and spellings as much as i can i also have trauma from my home country and just mentioning that i am from there makes me anxious and i feel paranoid talking to people from my own country i go back and edit comments constantly and im always deleting things people automatically find this behavior shifty and i have been called out a few times and people always think im up to something,3
like i dont really care if they think im dumb or even like me at this point in my life but something about knowing people see me is terrifying eye contact is the absolute worst because its percent focus i always try to look people in the eyes but have to look away within a second otherwise i feel like theyll hate me im m and its waaaay worse with women i feel like im invading their space just looking anywhere near them to the point i dont even know what their face looks like after an interaction when my best friend of years comes over to watch a movie i will not glance in their direction the entire time and stay on my side of the couch but i can converse just fine and not overthink my words at all i also feel like i have tunnel vision when im in grocery stores and if i go to a restaurant i will be stiffly hunched over my plate staring at the wall the entire time i just realized being blind would be kinda awesome and probably take away like percent of my stressors okay this got way out of hand im baked goodnight and if youre reading this i love you,3
i met a guy on a trip two years ago he told mutual friends that he liked me and he asked them not to tell me but they did when he found out that i knew he cut off all contact with me two months later he and his girlfriend broke up i have to admit that before he was single id look at his tiktoks a lot i never liked or commented on it id just watch the videos a few days before he and his girlfriend broke up i noticed that my tiktoks would go up i had followers but whenever id watch his videos a few hours later my tiktok views would rise i even tried doing it on certain days eg id watch his videos one day watch it two days later then the day after and each time i saw them my views went up and on the days that i didnt watch them they stayed the same this continued for the better part of a year last year it was still frequent but less so now its every two or three weeks that we do this one time he even posted a tiktok in english english isnt his first language and all of his previous videos were in his native language tiktok wasnt the only platform he was looking at me on he would do it on twitter too one time i retweeted a picture of a star wars character less than an hour later he posted a meme of that same character the meme was in english and its not that i want to say that the meme wasnt funny but it was obvious that he posted it just to post it theres been at least three other instances where he did something similar however twice he did things that tickled me funny about six months after they broke up he started following her on tiktok but unfollowed her within a few hours probably because she didnt follow him back a month later one of his exs close friends posted a tiktok video with his ex in it he started following this friend around eight months of this going on he made his instagram and tiktok private i have no idea why but i can tell he still looks at my tiktok because tiktok tells who looks at your profile i dont post much and he looks at it every two to three days,3
ive been on this subreddit for a good period of time now and its quite an active one with several posts every day and pretty much all of them receive a response of some sort whether its about people asking for advice or venting theres no toxicity theres no arguing theres just empathy and help so i just want to say that although living with avpd can be a painful existence that eats away at our selfesteem i appreciate all of you for making this subreddit such a great space,3
my presence makes others uncomfortable and i can feel it theres this awkwardness whenever i need to go out and i have to interact with others or when im with my own family i feel it and i know that awkwardness is because of me i dont know what im doing wrong i know some will say its in your head but no i really feel like my presence is just uncomfortable to be around you know sometimes people can sense things people can sense when youre sad or in my case uncomfortable in social interactions so they pick up on that and they arent used to that so then everything becomes uncomfortable i dont like this feeling,3
i think ive never given myself a chance to develop them because of avpd i couldve had a fuller social life in school but i was so in my shell i just had a few close friends and even with them i felt i couldve been better it seemed like they all clicked with each other very well and even though we were all good friends sometimes there was something missing in my connection with people i know they say skills are to be learned but it really really really seems like its just inborn for other people so i just do everything i can to avoid one on one conversations so nobody has the chance to think im weird and dont know how to talk or something,3
hey guys what are your favoritespecial films and tv show you adore mine are cherry drive wind river mandy is also one of favs especially the first half of the film and im a huge stranger things fan thats my favourite tv show,3
it doesnt matter who the other person is if we are engaged in a conversation the longer it takes the more symptoms i get at first i am ok then the worry begins in my head where at the same time i am talking i start observing myself the conversation continues but at this time the symptoms i have been worried about begin to appear my ears turn red my lips start to shake my thinking start to prepare for the impending possibility of having a panic attack while at the same time i start observing that the person i am talking to has now noticed that i am having a reaction my voice start to tremble as i must make some type of escape shame overtakes me as i now know that the other person knows that something just went wrong i abruptly end the conversation and remove myself now completely drained and knowing that in future conversations with that person this previous terrible episode will be the thing in my head and wondering if it will also be in their head later on as days pass i start noticing that the other person also becomes uncomfortable and looks anxious when talking to me but seems happy and relaxed when talking to other people after sometime i start avoiding them because it takes a toll on me if it is a place of employment over time i will have many of such episodes with different people and it becomes too much so i quit so i can start fresh somewhere else but i already know what the outcome will be at each new place i am and have been like that since high school some medications have helped particularly effexor also thinking about my lungs breathing and doing mindfulness while conversing have reduced it tremendously but many times i forget to do the work and i get the episodes this is all from times in my childhood where i was shamed in front of others and ridiculed by aunts uncles grandparents and teachers one of my grandmas used to on many occasions take her frustrations on me when i did something bad so for some reason now when i talk to other adults it triggers all of the reactions i had as a child when i was getting yelled at,3
hi ive been struggling a lot in school from even before college and lonely for most of my life ive been the odd one out since back when and slow on socialising i cant seem to use social media well too afraid that my relatives will find it andor hold conversations for very long even though i find people with the same interests ive gotten responses that range from implying that i annoy them or getting told my way of thinking is strange im not sure how to phrase this since i tend to notice my ideas get shot down and nitpicked more than others in my friend group or even project team setting i started withdrawing from my social circles as a result and getting used to living alone with myself my family been supportive of me thus far and i shouldnt complain but i cant live like this for very long i want to express myself and find a space for my art craft and ideas that accepts me for me and im sure in order to be independent i need to also be comfortable with myself but im not i live life now never crossing the line with people even if i think its a terrible idea and is proven to be for the purpose of avoiding conflict i withhold my ideas so as to not seem radical or stupid and avoid being berated or talked down i feel like a npc living a scripted life how do we overcome this and have the courage to live for us can i do it in a way to eliminate these stresses or is avoiding them the main issue,3
i m feel like any kind of datingrelationships is just work work work work work work i like the idea of having a connection in my life but i dont think im willing to do what it takes i think bc im so lowmaintenance i attract a lot of very clingy needy people which made me hate the idea of dating because theyd never leave me alone and not just the process of dating itself which sucks for most people but just being in a relationship requires too much work and expectations maybe im just lazy but how do you have the motivation to keep going with dating when its just annoyance,3
i dont know how common this is but its extremely difficult for me to find the strength in me to text people back and its killing my nonexistent social life and the possibility of ever finding love i live in constant guiltdread knowing that i have people in my dms trying to contact me to hang out but my fear of embarrassment and awkwardness is freaking killing me all ive ever wanted was to belong and be able to make friends but my brain literally stops me in my tracks its also necessary to note that i have adhd primarily inattentive and once i take my medication im lucky to have maybe min of adequate dopamine levels to push myself and reply sometimes i do reply but when i go back to baseline i just want to isolate and be in my dark room i really feel like im being tortured by my own brain its a terrible feeling to crave social interaction but to also be deathly afraid of the possibility that i could ruin everything and be viewed as an embarrassment i really dont feel worthy of having the opportunity to make friends my ssris have made me so numb and my personality rarely sparkles anymore so i cant imagine anyone would want to be around someone so dull do any of you relate it feels like a mental trap,3
yes im working on myself and its never to late to startchange but some things are time sensitive and ill just have to accept ill never have children for example sure i could pop one out right now but that wouldnt be the responsible thing to do given my mental state as well as just my general state of things there just isnt enough time for me to get well enough get my life in order find a reasonable partner get married and start a family before time runs out so now im just trying to prepare myself for when the inevitable comes and im still here left alone probably still struggling mentally that is all im sad this disorder has robbed me of so much and i still cant seem to get a handle on it,3
i try so hard to get close to people and basically no ones ever responsive and literally no one gives more than baseline politeness i expend so much energy trying and nothing comes of it all i get is hurt because people dont care about me at all it hurts so much to try and get nothing and rejection in return im genuinely wondering if theres really any point in me continuing to try when nothing works out and i just end up in so much pain i want to just give up and isolate to save energy and prevent this fucking god awful pain i keep feeling over and over again every time something social comes up i understand part of this hopeless feeling is my unrelenting depression but ive quite literally never been able to develop true close relationships outside fucking elementary school and im now,3
ive always been in awe of people who can just start talking every time i think i could say this its immediately dogpiled with other thoughts the self hating ones i dont have it in me to list them right now but if youre reading this unfortunately you probably know what i mean anyway i was heading out for my break on saturday and i got my marlboros out of my locker smoking is bad i know i bought them off a friend of a friend who stocked up on her trip to italy so i turned to my coworker notoriously one of if not the most outgoing in our little crew and said hey check these out and i showed him the picture of the blackened lung on the carton and we kind of joked about how fucked up it is that those kinds of health warnings are the norm in other countries but not here usa i dont really know what was different this time it must have been a beneficial glitch because i havent shown that degree of spontaneity since especially not while sober it was nothing and the self hating thoughts came right after but once those settled a bit it was nice thanks so much for reading i just wanted to ramble as always,3
if i interact with people a day turn out to be ok and the other will destroy my whole mood is it not better not to interact with all,3
so few years back i got avpd diagnosis i am now trying to get out of this rut and fix things thing is i have avoided everything all my life even my feelings so its hard one thing i am thinking of past few days is that when i knew i was gay at years old i avoided thinking about it and refusing to accept my sexuality i only came out once i was so years i was locked in avoiding being who i am i am in my s now and after a bad breakup been trying to figure my life out is it possible that being in the closet for more then years contribute in developing avpd as i notice i still dont accept my sexuality and still think what people might think of it and reject me because of my sexuality thats what i did when i first figured out i was gay thinking that my then friends would bully or reject me any other gay people here who can relate,3
i think my partner has bpd maybe avpd hi everyone i have no idea how to start this im honestly not even sure if bpd or avpd is correct im just grasping at straws at this point my f boyfriend ms brother has been diagnosed with bpd which is why this is my first step and while im obviously not looking for someone to diagnose him like this im just lost and need someone to listen i am massively struggling in my relationship and i just need someone to listen even if this goes nowhere my boyfriend asks for a lot of things for himself but is very hypocritical if i were to ask the same in return we just had a long talk so my brain is sort of foggy on details and i cant quite think of an example of that at the moment he does ask for things in one moment and when i do them or stick to it he tells me its wrong example he has wanted to get a photo id for a while we have two options drivers licence or a photo card about a month or probably two ago he said he needed photo id for a test at work hed been putting off then he said not long ago that we dont motivate each other to do the things we need to i know he has anxiety planning things and doesnt want to so for our anniversary i said pick which id you want ill drive you there pay for it and itll be done ill put all the planning into it all good and he loved that idea the day we were supposed to go he was angry about something and it caused an argument so we didnt go which got pushed off to the next week and the week after to today each week he said ill do it next week on my day off so i asked and he pushed it again today we spoke about it and while hes not good at planning i was waiting around to find out if we were going or not as i wanted to plan when i was done work and went to get gas and groceries when it was about hours before we had to leave if we were going for him to take the drivers test i told him that i didnt care if we went but if he wanted to study more now was the time he told me tonight that he only did it so id shut up about it and when i said you told me you wanted more motivation so i gave it to you he just said fair but we always have those moments where he says he wants something and i change to do it but then he gets pissy about it if i try and talk to him about my needs or what im wanting more of or how im hurt by something he tells me that he just wants to be left alone and that he never asked me for anything or hell just give me all the things about himself that suck or how he feels and completely disregards what i was even talking about if we have an argument for full hour lets say there will be lulls in the argument maybe every minutes maybe start half hour mark and then end it always changes but the lull is when he sits listens and answers me with respect the other times its that i have said even one word to set him off and hes miserable and angry and not nice im finding myself constantly working around his moods sort of judging if now is a good time to even show him a tiktok or something i find interesting if he agrees with what im showing him all is good if he doesnt he gets angry says hes confused and basically shuts down tells me he thinks thats dumb or why would someone even do that theyre not part of my life why do i even need to listen to that if im talking about my work or just complaining hell tell me why he doesnt want to hear it that its not part of his world so it doesnt matter ive asked him certain things to stop or change and whenever i do hell tell me something he needs in return he cant just take blame for things sometimes he can but normally cant i definitely do not help the situation because i am at his every beck and call and hes at none of mine if he asks to be left alone and i walk to another room he says he feels guilty that im going away and that hell just sit and stew and feel bad and then he doesnt get his way anyway he wants to be left alone a lot cant ever take anything i say and listen always has to tell me why whatever im going through is something hed love to have or how his life is worse example we moved for his work away from my family and friends and my best friend dropped me while she was being shitty all the time she was the last person i had to talk to and if im sad about it he tells me thats his dream for people to leave him alone and he doesnt understand why im upset if something small happens he wildly blows it out of proportion especially if its something he doesnt understand i have to be careful with how i joke with him because he will take everything to heart but has zero problem disrespecting me or poking fun at me for something if we go out at all he doesnt want to be there and will usually get extremely high or drunk to avoid socializing because it makes him anxious im just not sure if this is like anything anyone has dealt with and im looking for advice or help or just something thank you for reading this long novel i really appreciate you all,3
last few months i was struggeling with lots of depression so i started looking on internet and i found lots of mental illnesses and i really felt like this one is really matching my symptoms now when i somehow improved my depression i see myself differently and i feel differently i had depression my whole life without even realizing it for me having depression was a normal state sme i had no idea that there is a nondepression state but now when my depression improved i see that some of avpd symptoms starting disappearing and i feel better but at this point i am just not sure i might have it and depression was making it worse and i might now have it and it was just depression all the time,3
i have been very mentally exhausted i dont mind working long hours at my job its just at my job theres a lot of people around since its a large store connected to a bunch of departments a few months since i graduated high school ive been working but i cant seem to really talk to people i have a tendency to avoid the groups sometimes i cant even open my mouth its even worse when i think about how much i suck and how awful i look i feel like an inconvenience and a burden because plainly i am pretty stupid even though at the beginning of my job i was putting on a smile and a happy voice to convince myself it was okay i cant even get myself to smile or look people in the eyes unless i have to i am so exhausted i dont know whats wrong with me i am depressed both mentally and physically tired i really have no plans for my future,3
im not sure if this is due to the disorder or not if its imposter syndrome if its from old christian mantras of put others before yourself being baked into my psyche since childhood or if its a combination of all three but i often feel like i dont do enough for other people in my life whether its with other family members close friends or coworkers i often get this sense i work from home and ive done a lot on our current project over the course of this past year but now that were sitting near the finish line almost ready to golive with not much else to do other than wait for the cutover i cant help but feel some kind of guilt like im not doing enough even though i helped our team make a ton of progress in the past few months with friends or family it often comes in the form of should i be there or i know i be there be present but i really dont want to and then i just feel like a pos terrible friendsiblingsonetc for not doing it for example a relative of mine had a gender reveal party a few weeks ago naturally i didnt go im not particularly close with this family member and havent been for years nonetheless i still felt like an asshole for skipping especially later when i talked to my dad and asked how it went i asked who was there and he said just about everyone except for you i dont think he intended to make me feel guilty but it kind of did my mom corrected him later and pointed out a few other family members that didnt make it but nonetheless i felt like i didnt do enough even though again this relative having the child and i dont really talk or show interest in one anothers lives anymore another example is a friend a close friend who really does their best to help me get out of the house and do things theyll invite me to things at bars or restaurants and times out of i dont go part of me appreciates the hell out of that because i need it and its nice to be includedwanted another part of me wishes theyd leave me alone because i dont think im interesting enough or worthy enough to hang out with then i start feeling a whirlwind of guilt and shame for bailing out of the request wondering if all these feelings of guilt or shame are part of the disorder or if its something else anyone else experience this,3
theres always someone being rejected and when they show hatred for them i feel hated as well,3
not sure if this belongs here but im so upset about this that i havent slept all night my sister is my only friend i feel like she understands me more than anyone else im completely relaxed and comfortable around her i can just be myself without overthinking what i look like and how i come across shes basically the only person who is able to make me laugh ive always been open with her about my thoughts interests and even my mental health struggles i know its not healthy to expect one person to be my entire social life but i literally dont have anyone else i can talk to about anything yesterday i found out that shes been lying to me by saying shes meeting up with friends from school and sleeping over at her bffs apartment when in fact she has a rich foreigner boyfriend and shes been staying over at his place hes also been driving her on trips to nearby cities i knew this day would come my little sister had to grow up someday and get a boyfriend but i wasnt prepared to feel so alone abandoned and betrayed she never mentioned that guy to me and my father im disappointed that i had to find out about him from my mother i still havent talked to her since i found out about her relationship but i cant fathom why she would hide it from me when ive always told her everything of course i want her to be happy but now all im left to do is wait for her to get married move to a different country and forget about me leaving me to rot and die miserable and alone,3
in english theres both avoidant and anxious whereas in german theres ngstlichvermeidende anxiousavoidant and selbstunsichere self insecure the latter got me wondering if there are other names for it across the world,3
i have an online friend and they really wanted me to meet their friend i was hesitant but they told me that theyre nice so i joined their little discord server literally had like people total with me with the intentions of maybe sending a message or two and never again but their friend didnt even want to say hi to me like my friend told him to say hi and he literally just said no this happened a few days ago and im like really upset about it he barely even knows anything about me i talked to my friend today and they said that they think he is just jealous that im sort of close with them but im still really really hurt and upset about i feel like im not even deserving of being acknowledged or spoken to,3
all i know how to do is play video games watch youtube and repeat the same things like a dumb monkey the past weeks i tried taking a course in computer science and i tried starting to learn japanese and all i can do is watch and wait for something to click in my brain theres nothing in me no creativity no selfsufficiency no capacity for independent thought i dont understand how ive made it this far im scared im terrified i dont know what to do with myself anymore,3
is there a point where one can consider it too late to do anything too late to try too late to get treatment too late for anything and everything too old or if someone is too badly off ive seen some people around reddit and the net refer to failed lives ive recently made posts and tried to look around reddit for people in a similar situation as mine and there seems to be nobody and the only conclusion i can draw is that my circumstances are too uniquely screwed up and avpd along with other issues all intersecting have led to a completely failed life and me as a broken mess growing up or developing avpd in a family full of npd didnt help most subs seem to skew younger which has me think that everybody either resolved their issues as they grew up or are no longer alive how has anybody dealt with utter despair and hopelessness feeling too old and that its too late to change anything satisfactorily does anyone have other issuesdiagnoses that mix with avpd to just make things impossible,3
i know people with avpd struggle to maintain friendships and i do too for me i think its the daily or at least frequent messaging to stay in touch that i struggle with i will get tired and ignore messages just because i dont have the capacity to engage with a subject that i frankly probably dont care much about or im just worn out by the constant interaction the messaging for the sake of messaging gets to me if its a friend that lived far away then id rather not speak for months and then just meet up and have a good time before reverting back to usual which for me is far less exhausting and fortunately i do have a couple that are like that anyone relate,3
using my alt throwaway because reasons recently ive been having a hard time and although i have deeply caring and wonderful people in my life i still isolate and as much as i crave time with others i get tired so easily after a short while also grew up with cluster b parents and family which doomed me to some kind of mental problems lately ive begun to think about the idea of just leaving disappearing no trace not suicide im not suicidal at all i mean leaving going somewhere im not known changing all my details and completely starting over i cant help but feel it would make no difference to anyone in fact it might even be better ive googled step by step how tos on it im hoping to be able to talk to others who have been in this dark of a place and what got you through or any advice because this is mostly just a fantasy but the idea is sticking in my head more than id like it to i dont actually want to go through with it i think edit for clarity what got you through the mental state if youve felt this way not advice on disappearing oops,3
i got a new therapist today i am nervous she called and she sounds nice i have had horrible experiences in the past but i decided that i can no longer be stuck i need to move forward but i need help knowing how and maybe this will be helpful i am going to try you gotta get up and try try try,3
i went to the mall to buy some fragrances and i came off as a massive asshole to the cashiers there was originally only one girl that was attending the area i went to so i thought i would be fine wrong she seemed like she was new and when i asked her for the fragrance i wanted she seemed confused and said she was going to get someone to help me she came back with two women and theyre all staring at me while i say what i want then one of the women she brought back started asking me questions i wasnt prepared for this and i sort of shut down she asked me what i was currently wearing and i lied and said i didnt wear anything currently then she asked me if i would wear something sweeter than the fragrance i had picked out and i just shook my head and looked at some other bottles of perfume i acted mostly dismissive towards the three women because i was so uncomfortable and just wanted the situation to end i wanted to get out of the situation as fast as possible so i grabbed a different fragrance that i was familiar with and told them i would just buy that i had tried to prepare myself beforehand to speak to one person because the last time i went there was only one person i had to talk to talking to three people made me so uncomfortable and i acted like a dismissive asshole i thought it would be really easy for me since i already knew what i wanted and i assumed i could just tell the lady the name of what i wanted and she would tell me whether they had it or not i also feel really bad for the new girl because i could tell she didnt really know what she was doing and i just made it worse for her and the lady that was asking me questions seemed very nice and i feel bad for acting the way i did now that i think about it the second lady was probably trying to set an example to the new girl and i ruined it for her i had avoided buying fragrances online in fear that the bottles would break in the mail but i will probably only buy them online from now on this experience made me realize that i also act cold and assholeish to everyone thats not the people i live with or my mom but thats also the only way i can speak to people so im kind of stuck between dont socialize at all or act cold to everyone,3
im not diagnosed but i always thought there was something deeply wrong with me ive never kept a friend longer than a couple years im in my second year of college and i have been at zero since covid happened ive transferred schools so new place and new people and im more isolated than before it feels like im not human because im unable to do the human thing and communicate like im watching and observing but as an alien or a void or something that looks human but if you look to closely its all distorted or robotic even someones failed attempt at a human being all i do is lay in bed and ruminate over every bad interaction with past friends and family or think about how my roommates or classmates perceive me fake conversations justifying my actions to absolutely no one it feels like im going insane i thought it was just social anxiety but i dont get panic attacks and my reluctance and inability feels wired directly into my veins every fiber of my being and it feels like it cant be undone like my entire identity is wrapped up in being alone and thats all ill ever be,3
recently ive been distancing from my friend because i needed some space but after a while i noticed they seem happier without me like actually laughing and smiling more they even started talking to a very cool person and they even talk to other ppl in the group more often so now im kinda isolating myself because well i just want them to be happy if being absent from their life is what will make them happier ill do that seems like im just a toxic person that drains everyone around them,3
anyone addicted to the internet like more then the rest of the world do you use it as coping mechanism,3
hello i guess we all share this feeling of shame following us all around i cant remember much of my life but i can remember almost every time ive felt shame and i did it a lot of times so much that even moments of my life that i had been sa are flashing in my mind all day but other memories are just plain shame shame of what i did in a specific moment shame of how i reacted what ive said shame on how i was dressed the way my face looked what i recognise is that these are stupid reasons to feel shame and i think anyone neurotypical wouldnt even think is such a big thing i even felt shame and guilt of breaking things because anything material has more value than me i legit had a panic attack once after dropping a water glass i wanted to hold the broken glass and squeeze it with my hands until i made them disappear i can remember most of the times i broke things ampxb how do you cope with these feelings coming to your mind in your daily life when i remember one time i start remembering the others they are connected and so they come all together to me and make me feel that i will never delete those moments from existence that they already happened that there is no way i could live with those things that happened i feel shame from myself all the time but when those memories come to me i want to snap out of existence i dont know how to deal with that thank you,3
well real consequences already happened and i avoided facing the feelings that wouldve prevented them from happening but now my parents are threatening putting me in a halfway home or making me live with them again them saying they would sell the house which utterly terrifies me but in the face of how my life has gone suicide is also a considerable option tho not one i can follow through on but its becoming easier to every day its amazing how the economy and life can utterly ruin people isnt it why is it so hard for me to speak in my own voice oh right the trauma its really hard to drag them out of it as their minds resemble mine far too much and mine resembles theirs far too much the pain of having to get a job while also not even being able to be myself in real life is really depressing i feel like just another person with unfulfilled dreams forced to grow up and accept reality,3
im fairly certain i have avpd and have had so for the majority of my life like i have almost all of the symptoms down the the horrible childhood trauma that i experienced that started my downfall avpd is the only condition that ive been able to match up to down to a tee ive went to therapy and discussed my issues but it doesnt seem like avpd is something i can ever officially get diagnosed with while im fairly certain i have avpd my case is more mild because it doesnt completely shut down my life i would consider myself with high functioning avpd since i was young ive always been lonely and had to figure out life out on my own since i didnt have my parents or a loving family to grow up with as a result out of necessity i had to be financially independent and look after myself working and going to college was a never an issue for me because of that ive been able to give myself a good career and more or less have an ok life my avpd is most severe in my personal daily life away from work its a daily struggle for me i also match all of the social symptoms of avpd and live a life of loneliness because i cant get myself out to meet people regularly can anyone else relate,3
i wonder if avoiding woman can be avpd i have avoided woman almost my whole life at some point in high school i liked a girl i talked to a bit but never full got to know her because of paranoia of not having a car or being able to provide for her in any way its probably the only time i spoke with a girl mainly because i was invested in wanting to be with he but was to afraid to be with her in a relationship if avpd is not only avoiding woman for my instance then i dont understand avpd,3
i havent been diagnosed with avpd but i think i may have this disorder i was always an anxious child then in my teens i started taking panic attacks before any social situation but mainly before going to school so i stopped going to school i just avoided it im now nearly and ive never held down a job for more than a couple of weeks and have dropped out of a few college courses due to having bad attendance i feel like i now avoid anything that causes me the tiniest bit of stress by not leaving my house sleeping and not letting anyone know about it i then get really depressed and disappointed in my self it just feels like an endless cycle of me not showing and getting down about im just wondering how avpd affects others and if there is anyone from the uk suffering from avpd thanks,3
i feel like im dying like theres a hole in my chest and thoughts make me feel like im falling in im also having very negative thoughts im realising im angry at myself for being vulnerable enough for this to happen to me please help if youve been through thisi see no hope ps i mean rejected after asking a girl out ive been talking to for months,3
pretty much the title i just cant stand her i never liked her ever since i was a little kid but for me that hate went much higher beyond it just to clarify i dont think she is the abusive type more like the overcontrolling and overbearing type of mom the type that when you make a mistake or fail to do as she asks even if its just the order of the way i put things in their place she will scold and do it herself even if those are my things she isnt satisfied with the way i put my clothes in my wardrobe or when i dont do it immediately and barely have any respect to my privacy in the past she wouldnt even let me close my own door so my room was always open even this days she complain when i dont leave a gap but on that case i dont give a fuck anymore and barely leaves any not a door you can close easily and she would always complain about im not normal or like the other kidspeople because i dont act or do things they do and i cant forget her what you gonna do with your life play on the computer all day speech which she does when she remembers she needs to get mad or moody for no reason im afraid of embarrassing myself in public im afraid of even doing some of the basic stuff because i dont think i can do it or ill make a clown out of myself and it always comes back to how i was never really taught how to control my own life and be independent even in the few times she did taught me anything she would still eventually take control and it doesnt make me motivated to even try one of the reasons i eat in my room is because i just dont want to be around her because i will always get criticized for something my beard which no one taught me how to do it and my dad lives abroad my ears my hair my clothes everything she always tries to pick things for me to wear and while today i do wear whatever i want regardless of her opinionpicks i still remember that when i was younger she would be upset and mad if i didnt wear what she wanted me to wear and she still kinda give the bitch look but as i said i still wear what i wear and the judgement doesnt stop at that her favorite habit is that on events and gatherings she would always whisper in my ear whats wrong me in the moment could be anything from noticing something dirty or not to her eyes that no gives a fuck about the way i behave why you are not smiling and all other type of shit to make me lose confidence or be overly aware of my problems she would always try to buy me stuff i dont want or asked to get and would always expect me to thank her even if sometimes she was the one that was pressuring me to get something when i think about all of this and other stuff i understand why im so incompetent afraid of making mistakes or embarrassing myself and stuck in that avoident and depressive mind set its not all her there are things i probably couldve done myself and still can do and even without her the competitive and soulless society most of us are part of just adds a lot to the way we end up and still she has a part in why my life fucking sucks and now i need to find a way to get back on track somehow also today i pretty much snapped at her in an unrelated case which eventually also happened because of all those feelings i stored inside i dont talk to her and tbh its such a good feeling ps if there was another post made by me thats titled the same blame my stupid phone for this xd im also sorry for possible grammar mistakes dont mind someone fixin them,3
im so tired im so bored i dont do anything i am not capable of doing anything everytime i try i fail i mess up i cannot do anything i cannot do anything right i want to disappear i cannot stand this,3
why do i want to be famoussomeone dm me pls this is a throwaway account people on social media always say im trying to get attention but wtf is wrong with that i dont know for sure if i have avpd but i think i do i cant pay for therapy i live with my mom and i hate her im cant drive alone i always get in crashes or get a ticket sometimes i speed because im mad at my uncle i have a job but i dropped out of school because i dont care and i have so much trauma from everything in my childhood and anyway nothing matters now except being famous thats all i want i just have no idea why in real life i avoid people but online i have a girlfriend and im obsessed with her it scares me sometimes because i cant stop thinking about her and if she broke up with me i dont think i could take it ive only met her once in real life but it doesnt matter i talk to her all the time but the most important thing is that she talks to me and shes obsessed with me so i need her i think i deserve to be famous more than anyone else because ive been through so much and also i feel like im better than most people something about me is different and im special can someone dm me to talk more about this i need to know why i want to be famous and how can i get famous also is it possible to have avpd and want to be famous,3
not sure if this is just me but the more i self reflect the more i realize that im unhealthily antisocial but ok with that until i feel societal pressure to be different ive always been a loner and i can be like that all the time but the only time i feel shameful of that is when im around other people who arent like that and find it weird its almost like one part of me desires companionship and being more friendly because thats what you need for a happy life apparently but putting myself out there never satisfies me having friends just stresses me out and makes me deeply insecure theres literally no satisfaction i get from it i guess im deeply unhealthy but i love to isolate and cant relate to others and feel insecure about it like i wish i could be in the standard of whats normal but im also really addicted to unhealthy habits do i sound crazy its hard to put into words how i feel but its like im so closed off and avoidant around people and get stressed about societal pressures but am ok with my unhealthy isolation until i realize other people dont live their lives like that i dont want to miss out but find it hard to change i guess my behavior isnt normal but trying to fit in just makes my anxiety so bad hopefully somebody understands what i mean i think this is just how it is when your mentality ill for a long period of time,3
do you have anhedonia lack of strong emotions view pollhttpswwwredditcompollpxz,3
anybody else feel like they dont have the natural ability to have good conversations whenever im having a conversation with strangers im often pretty quiet and i dont know what to say unless its work related or something im really familiar with i think this is normal with society anxiety though but whenever i have conversations with a group of people im comfortable with like my family i feel like i suck at having conversations if its about a topic i dont care about i always zone out or stare at out the window if its about a topic im interested in its so hard to wait my turn to talk i feel so impatient to wait my turn i can wait but it stresses me out and its hard to jump in sometimes it feels like im going to forget what i was going to say or theyll change the topic before i can talk and then when i talk i feel like people dont really care about what i have to say my family always talks over me or focus on what the person said before me they never remember what i say either in the future compared to what my siblings say it feels like a chore to have conversations sometimes its just easier to stay quiet and fade into the background anybody relate,3
if i made the effort to challenge myself everyday could i eventually change and maybe even get rid of my avpd so tired of living like this and im still young so hopefully its possible,3
i think im doing better at socializing than before but after a big socialization day i get so worn out from all the effort it takes that i need a recovery day where i literally dont interact with anyone or else i start shutting down however society does not work on my schedule and so obviously i cant always have a recovery when im socially overwhelmed i tend to give short answers and seem super aloof disinterested monotone etc sometimes people take this personally even though it has nothing to do with them im just worn out usually with strangers it doesnt matter that much because ill never meet them again but with my friends or partner it can be hard they obviously care about me and start asking are you mad at me am i annoying etc and that kind of stuff is really irritating because it requires some level of delicacy by saying you as a person are not annoying but im just really irritated right now for reasons other than you and you are exacerbating it but it is not your fault and theres no reason you wouldve known this like i wish i could just say that but literally nothing comes out of my mouth i cant manage anything other than a tiny whimper of a no because i at least want to preserve their feelings my partner especially gets insecure and frequently asks me are you mad at me do you hate me am i annoying somewhat in jest but also to an extent its a reflection of real insecurities i know she has told me about i cant handle navigating those questions when im socially overstimulated but i dont want to make her insecure worse either i know a relationship is a two way street but i always feel like a burden for my emotions and needs any advice,3
i realised that i never really had or was aware of life goals or dreams i had i think this is why i dont really feel like a person and so different from others and why i never let anyone get close to me otherwise they would realise how different i am and distance themselves do you have dreams and goals have you ever had them maybe as kids,3
its so depressing to think people have spent all these years going out with their friends and partying whilst i was just on my own in my room ive always had barely any friends and never been in a relationship or had a paid job i only managed to start doing a few hours a week voluntary work a few months ago i watch the people around me do exciting things and make new friends and get partners whilst im just here bored alone and depressed as usual it doesnt help that later this year ill move away from this town for university and ill probably never see most of the people ive spent years wanting to be friends or more with but been too scared to talk to again it feels like this phase of my life is really slipping through my fingers and i have no time to repair it i try to tell myself at least i have the future where i could become better and make the next phases of my life better than this one but in reality i know that ive just been declining for years so i doubt that very much,3
and i realized that the reason im like this is that ive viewed other people as threats my whole life ever since i was little ive implicitly assumed that other people want to hurt me until and unless i have incontrovertible evidence to the contrary i have no idea why im like this it sounds like something someone who was abused would write but i wasnt my parents were nice and caring i just came out wrong somehow lmao i had nothing to be afraid of and yet i was terrified of everything,3
i just thought i would share a good thing i have been trying to go to the gym for a while i would drive to the parking lot then turn around and go home today i went in and walked on the treadmill i feel so happy about it especially after i got the courage to go to church a few weeks ago after missing years and saw someone very triggering and had a melt down for the rest of the day it made me feel there might be no point in doing things if it is just going to lead to feeling sad and stressed,3
i actually went to a garden party there were tiny sandwiches a bunch of fruit and little cracker plates with meats and cheeses i actually felt comfortable the whole time ive been on some medicine these past few weeks i cant remember the name and i think they may actually be working i still get depressed andor anxious around the night time or when im not doing something i just have to keep myself busy and ill be okay but about the party i knew almost everyone there ive known them for a long time now and theyre closer to me than my family i helped set up the party so i didnt feel like i wasnt being useful i took my time this morning in making sure i looked presentable and of course i showed up early just in case the party lasted about an hour and a half and i even got to talk with some of the people there today is just a great day so far and not if but when things start to go back down to normal i hope i dont forget that i was able to be happy today i know progress can jump forward just as much as it falls back but im going to celebrate today as progress,3
i was a college freshman at the beginning of covid i was just your stereotypical introverted quiet guy who also struggled in social situations covid gave me the perfect excuse to avoid anything stressful dont have to go to class dont have to meet anybody everyday i just drowned myself in entertainment eventually i dropped out of class and basically became a shut in fast forward to a couple years later i have no idea how time went by so fast everyone is all grown up and busy people keep asking about how im doing at school and everytime i lie to my parents that yeah im going to school i did good on my exams im about to graduate etc its so fucking unfair to my parents that i turned out to be such a piece of shit i hate what ive become just lies and avoidance when im actually motivated to do something im then immediately reminded by the reality that no matter what i do i still wasted all these years of my adulthood that im still betraying my parents expectations that nothing i do is going to undo all the damage i did to myself im a mess i have no hobbies i can share with normal people i have no humor because i dont have any experience in the real world i cant make my family happy because i dont even like myself and it shows sorry for the rant sometimes you take a step back and really look at the situation you put yourself in and its unbearable why didnt i try harder at school why didnt i tell my parents the truth facing all these fears i chose the easy way and it is clearly the wrong choice otherwise i wouldnt be suffering this much now if youre reading this i hope you can learn not to be like me avoidance is hell,3
hour road trip with my friend to go have coffee with our other friend long story short as possible weve been best friends for almost years they both moved away from our home town over ten years ago now the one who lives hours away is coming for a few weeks in the summer and she wants to drive to see the one who lives a little over five hours away he only has the day to visit i am not on vacation in fact shes coming during a time i cant really take,3
like a clown i put on a show the pain is real even if nobody knows now im cryin inside and nobody knows it but me the lyrics from the song nobody knows by tony rich project has always really stuck with me it illustrated perfectly how id felt for such a long time it hit me like a load of bricks how beautifully it described that feeling a feeling that id struggled so much to put into words was put so simply and it brings tears to my eyes even now how sad it is that only you would know this feeling and nobody could relate its a tragic love song actually but some lines of the song just resonate with me as someone with avp httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvpfbaiaihttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvpfbaiai,3
i am an avoidant diagnosed i got high and looked inside my reality of my concept of self i wrote down what i actually am inside felt like tearing into the layers of characters i built over the base of immaturity or even aware of a concept of such felt like a young boy with undiagnosed issues of maturity like a man child ugly and unresolved petty character outwardly pretending to grown but inwardly hardly even close to a understanding the concept of growth the gap is hugely unfilled between my physical age and the inner development the concept of even self feels unexplained i have some yong age attachment issues that are manifested in my personality my interaction with people is so shallow with no depth not in a negative outlook but that of a unprocessed thought of self i am hardly maintaining to keep a distorted adult character on my face i have not understood anything of heartfelt feel good emotions as i havent even dwelled on it and just brush it off rather to even process as mature person i just didnt realise that i have actually bypassed all this ages without feeling anything natural maturity that one goes through,3
i feel like my whole existence is a failure i want to connect but i cant ive always been way too boring for others its been a bit hard lately the only people i ever really connected with are people that are supposed to be authority figures therapist and a teacher so they kind of have to put up with me i mean my therapist gets paid to talk to people besides that he probably has hundreds of other clients hell probably be glad if i left one less complicated issue to take care of if i left he and no one else would remember me anyways but i honestly dont want to be forgotten it hurts ive never spent time with people in my childhood i was the weird gay kid the f word the one that gets picked last in pe class and has always been shorter and weaker than other guys we once visited my cousins when i was very young my father got along so much better with my cousins who are all more boyish than i was i was quiet and boring my mother told me her dream was to be a grandmother why else would anyone want a child she definitely didnt win in the lottery because im as gay as they come i almost never spend time with my family i was too young to remember my actual first holiday it has always been just my room and i how am i not supposed to be hurt that the only people i enjoy talking to are people i will never spend time with outside of their job it feels so unfair i wish i could end it all sometimes but i dont want anyone to find my corpse probably traumatizing them once again im probably only doing this because deep down i want pity but this is my only emotional outlet right now,3
im looking for some ideas or thoughts every holiday since childhood im now i spent in my hometown living with my parents who used to be pretty abusive despite them now trying to do better i still think its not healthy for me to be there for months straight but idk what to do i got no friends or relationship duh and i only finished highschool i dont mind strangers seeing me too much i mainly struggle with seeing someone regularly i got few thousands saved since i never used to spend money on anything im not thinking about travelling rather renting something in nature and staying in one place for a month or two i was thinking maybe look for an animal shelter job in my country but i doubt theyll hire me for a month on the other hand im afraid ill be completely bored do yall have any thoughts about that or have you done sth similar,3
i used zoloft for days a month ago didnt feel a thing except an even deader libido and worse sleep just wondering if any of you felt easier on it during longer periods does it help with physical intimacy phobia and other anxiety attacks panic etc im going to the gym and plan on doing steroids just to shoot my confidence and libido up hoping it takes care of everything but taking zoloft while doing that might be counterproductive just wondering if some of you had luck with ads or maybe anabolic steroids,3
im tired of wanting love i get the courage to ask a girl out only to get shot down i can kind of talk up people one on one but in groups i freeze when youre in a relationship you have to form relationships with their friends and family but that seem nearly impossible has anyone figured out how to happily detach the only relationships i can seem to find are with women with bpd this always leads me to ruining my life and taking years to start over,3
i havent had a bf or been intimate with a guy in years i cant fend off the feeling of desperate loneliness anymore ive been trying tinder for the nd time used it for a brief period last year but never really talked to anyone before uninstalling and have been forcing myself to put in an effort responding to messages and messaging first but it hasnt been going wellthere were a few guys who i thought i was hitting it off with but they all stopped responding to me eventually the last one hurt the most because i had gathered up the courage to ask him to meet me i dont know what i did wrong i thought things were going ok we had been chatting regularly for a little more than a week i messaged him again this morning to let him know i was available today if he wanted to see me and he still didnt get back to me and probably never will im devastated right now i was so happy about talking with this guy a few days ago and now im back to being as lonely as ever another lonely friday nighti dont know how much more of it i can take i dont know if i want to keep trying if its just gong to be constant rejection it seems inevitable i screw everything up and drive people away with my shitty personality i shouldnt even be surprised this happened but it still hurts so much,3
i cant count how many times ive begun to integrate into a new social setting only to ghost it all without a word because of the anxiety of unspoken social expectations,3

stop self harming by stalking people yada yada yada i know i know i know better but im sick of being told they only show the happy moments no shit but they have happy moments they have adventures with friends that they post every other week or even just every month and some of them even post every week or more im in my early s and so many people i went to high school with are traveling the world before theyre tied down with more responsibilities and their bodies fall apart mine already is not because theyre rich but because theyre simply financially comfortable and have connections with people social skills and because theyre not afraid to take risks and because theyve built a life for themselves an identity since early on in high school maybe even earlier which makes doing all of this feel normal to them makes it all so much easier for them and if theyre not traveling theyre still going on smaller adventures with friends and gfsbfs or theyre performing in a band at local venues and theyre actually good now or theyre about to graduate college envy kills me im so fucked up i took a gap year to figure out what i want to do with my life only to drop out of an overpriced community college this year because i still feel too directionless and i know i could have at least a small chance at what these people have if only i would get off my ass instead of sulking i actually just checked more like stalked because im not following any of these people instagram for the first time in months hurt even more than it did the last time and in those months where i stopped looking at their lives did mine improve did pretending they arent living happy fulfilling lives by avoiding their social media posts altogether make my life any better contrary to what every mentalhealthgurugenius on reddit claims no it didnt make my life any better im still stuck i try my hardest every day and im still stuck sure ive finally had a job at this point in my life retail but i snapped and quit i can drive now though i hate it i can go by the mall by myself and do some shopping not that i have money to spend and yet its nothing it means nothing because its not enough not enough for society and not enough to make me feel fulfilled because it means nothing without other people,3
i opened up to coworkers about being bisexual and it feels awful feeling so vulnerable and exposed it feels really bad giving people ammo to judge you but i took a big risk opening up to them in hopes it brings us closer well see how it pays off but right now it feels super uncomfortable,3
this is in response to another post about the strip club anyway my friend took me and paid for a lap dance from this experience i learned something i dont think its for me in fact i think im a sexless sort of entity like a fungus or a germ the part on stage was super awkward i ended up trying to put money into the strippers fat roll because i was too nervous to find the strap are you feeling my cringe then theres the fact that she spent a lot of time putting her butt in my face so the thought of buttholes was just ever present and killed the mood for me i was also hyper aware of my face and trying to either keep a straight face or look impressed dont give away that im not feeling it then my friend insisted on buying that same lady for the lap dance i was trying to politely say no but he didnt understand also he bought two or three anyway she kept grinding up on me now another poster here told me that nobody would be paying attention to whether or not you become aroused but trust me she noticed and she seemed kind of mad about it and i ended up being depressed because i couldnt help but feel like something was wrong with me i mean not even a twitch i was so relieved when it was over and i dont think im ever going back good learning experience i guess,3
having a caretaker that herself demonstrated anxiety at least when i was years old or older was a major problem for me her crying and certain angry responses to distress really messed me up i think her low level of confidence relative to my dad though even my dad is low in emotional intelligence it is only now that i realize that it had a negative impact on me,3
i have avpd bpd and major depression myself i was wondering what you deal with in your daily lives,3
so a couple of days ago i opened up about my anxiety and all the mental struggles i deal with to a friend now i feel like i over shared and feel guilty by doing so i feel vulnerable whenever i am with him like i cant hide behind a mask it feels so scary when you feel like they will also leave you eventually because they see the real you,3
just forgetting it and realizing that i will not carry those people along with me for the rest of my life has been such a boon those were just a random assemblage of people thrown at me nothing less nothing more they dont matter to me anymore,3

after not being able to step foot out of the house without my ex driving me i finally was able to step up and go on public transit by myself its been years since ive taken the bus i honestly did not know what i was doing but i asked the drivers for help and directions as to which bus to get on next etc etc social anxiety was at an all time high and still is writing this on the way home so many people are on this bus and the only thing im thinking about is when do i get home and why are they looking at me realistically theyre looking at me because people have eyes and observe whats in front of them and scolding myself that they dont have hidden agendas is helping lol for anyone who hasnt been able to take public transit because of this stupid fucking difficult disorder i sympathize it gets easier dont have much to say just wanted to share bc this is a massive achievement for me,3
relationships seem pointless and i dont know if i could even handle being in one anyway ive basically been alone my whole life and i dont know how to be anything else ive never even had a crush on an actual person it sounds conceited but nobody ive met is interesting to me in that way and i feel like if i gave someone a chance id just end up breaking their heart because of this nothingness inside me right now i cant even imagine myself being intimate with anyone and i feel like im not emotionally available enough to have someone rely on me like that theyd probably end up feeling more like a burden to me more than anything and i dont want to do that to anyone i really hope one day im wrong and ill meet someone that makes me feel a little more human but i dont have much hope,3
but i dont even wanna get to know them at all its like ill get sad and feel like no one wants to be around me and im excluded a lot im never the first choice but if i actually get it my way and get included and someone try to befriend me i suddenly lose interest and change my mind its very annoying i know i actually dont wanna befriend anyone right now but i get sad when im excluded or not chosen regardless i wish i could be more careless i know why this is tho because if they actually show interest in befriending me and they find me pleasant to be around i will get kinda overexcited and will be with them at all times and sometimes that scares people away its either i avoid people like the plague or i get too attached both is equally as bad tbh but i cant help but feel sad when i see people get along so well so easily and so fast while im sitting by myself theres times i starve not on purpose but because i dont wanna sit in the cafeteria at school where do i even sit this week ive only eaten two pizza slices and some candy also drank some chocolate milk i just dont wanna be around anyone i managed to grab some dinner from the cafeteria earlier tho i live on campus i have two years left of my time at school and im trying to just force myself through it all i know i wont get better and i cant try as much as i would like but i know ill go back to being avoidant the second something goes wrong i can be the most friendliest person youve ever met and be lively and bubbly but the very second someone shows the most minuscule sign they dont enjoy being around me i start to go into avoidant mode ill lock myself up in my room and go offline from all social medias play games all day appetite depletes and all that stuff it can last for months well anyways that was just a little rant if you will i dont have anyone to talk to obviously and thought maybe someone here would understand and relate at least it helps a little,3
went on a date a week ago for the first time in years normally i am not attracted to people but this time i felt super attracted to this person good talks and the whole day we spent together we had sex but i did not sleep at that persons place bc thats too intimate for me i see sex a something purely physical but sleeping is too scary for me however that person didnt text me for a week so i texted to ask to go to a concert with a mutual friend still no response for days i feel so insecure and rejected and it confirms the negative view i already have about myself i really would like to have a relationship and fall in love but even dating makes me feel so worthless ugly stupid and anxious even after one date sorry for the vent but this is the only place i feel i can share this other people say that i just need to relax stop overreacting and stop being insecure and blablabla thats why i never share these feelings with people,3
there were few people who i just get to know and they almost instantly were like i have this mental illnessdisorder that i am stalking people i know i was thinking like oh okay thanks for telling me i dont know why people do that do i look like some mental health professional or psychiatrist,3
the other day my mum left the house and my dog had zoomies i thought how strange maybe she is glad she has me all to herself then i became aware that all the tension went out the door with her ive been so isolated with only my mum as company that i forgot how different kind and cool other people can be id become a bit of a misanthrope however on walks ive met some really genuine and good people it was shocking i couldnt believe it its making me realise how harmful being in constant contact with my mother who is extremely toxic is for my affiliation with humans i cant wait to move away from her maybe im not doomed to be alone,3
sooooim years old i have a group of about friends in my home town in another state to where i live but of them i did not make all of those were made by my best friend back in school who i befriended at age who is quite outgoing and then we just had this friendship group which started at and then eventually grew and i count them all as my friends but i never actually made any of them myself i made not a single friend in university i made friends at my first job when i was but we never saw each other outside the workplace and i havent heard from them in years since i left there i made friends at a subsequent workplace when i was about but one kind of kept trying to be my friend so insistently that eventually i gave in and she was fun and nice but i havent seen her for over years the other one i realised later was my favourite person fp bpd lingo and that is the only reason i was interested enough to want to get to know her and want her to get to know me i had a platonic crush on her even so after years my interest fizzled and i havent heard from her since also about years ago then when i was i made a friend here in my building she lives in my home town most of the year but has a place here too and she became my favourite person which again is why i let her in and we became close again my feelings of attraction fizzled after about years and were still friends but i hardly see her as she doesnt live here most of the time so i feel like my friends are all mainly made via my original friend who i made at age and now years lateri still dont really have any friends and havent really made any is that weird,3
i find it extremely anxiety inducing to be disliked and appearing rude or non caring elicits this reaction from others the funny thing is i am continually day after day in my attempts not to appear this way am this way i dont give solid eye contact to others mere glances i hide myself away in plain sight with poor meek body language i carry myself without confidence to avoid interactions all in vain attempts of appearing in my delusional mind nice it is so self destructive you essentially let people walk over you ignore you in some desire to be liked by people who dislike you will come to dislike you as a result of your behaviours or simply horrible people who you wouldnt want to like you let me give an example of what im thinking youre shopping for groceries you want to look at a shelf which is currently occupied by someone else you need something on that shelf like a tin of food or something usually i will see this and think oh my god dont want them to know i need something there heavens forbid if they see me what will they think so i quickly change direction and pretend to look at other items until they move so instead why not stand in their shadow and wait patiently let your presence be seen in an ideal world ask them to make space if you know exactly what you need but that would come when youre more confident so yes stand next to them and dont budge just let them know non verbally youre waiting another example youre at the cashier theyre doing your items i always look everywhere but where i need to look i lose focus on what i should be looking at which is the items im paying for the cashiers eyes in case theyre trying to communicate something and what if they say something small talk for instance well maybe im not in the mood to pursue further small talk so why not just give closed answers why do i feel the need to fill the silences to say whatever i can to appear normal i come across as flustered shy unconfident i see it in their faces they see the fear they see the disgust on my face believing im a wrongin or something but its really just negativity brewing inside of me of being in such a anxiety inducing situation that causes these expressions on my face then they mirror it and i think awful things about myself so why not stay calmer speak slower not try and have a positive small talk experience just take things at my own pace otherwise i leave feeling utterly embarrassed ashamed and the next time i shop there and there my cashier theyre going to hate that im there as opposed to being more stoic and less nervously chatty im rambling a bit losing focus on my words sorry but some of that probably doesnt make sense i hope you get the type of rude im talking about its not purposefully being rude its more being true to yourself being comfortable in your own body and standing up to be counted as an equal something i avoid any ideas or experiences suggestions on these niche topic please,3
did you get famous through writing blogging or designing etc online how did you deal with it how did it make you feel,3
this might be silly questions to ask but does anyone else feel like theyre younger than their actual age like their mindset is younger than the age that they are im guessing its maybe due to lack of social interactions with people in the same age group but i just want to know if anyone else feels like this,3
ive always had a good amount of selfawareness but with that i can see the depth of problems i know the minimum depth and it is already potentially too much my ability to change is not as much now my brain is not set up for normal life ive become institutionalized im past yo i cant relate to average people im cynical of most and the ones im not cynical of want nothing to do with me,3
im a mental cripple im years old and i missed all the formative experiences in my life relationships kissing having sex dogshit family years of bullying and this is whats left legit what the fuck lmao and you know whats funny i realized this couple of months ago i legit had no idea that i had it insanely bad up until now drunk friend got on top of me we made out she started undressing and i legit just stared at her blank had no idea what to do why she would do that and what to think thats when it hit me im an absolute social failure i can never initiate anything i never talk about emotions and now i truly understand the only way ill ever have sex is by getting raped thats it i cant even return a fucking hug i dont want to be like this im fucking already i legit didnt care about any of that until i realized how nice a kiss felt i can only imagine what sex feels like i fucking hate my life i fucking hate ill never get to be with someone because all i can do is shut inside myself and cry from a distance funny thing is im fit and average looking with a way above average salary but its all useless when i have absolutely social skills fuck my parents and fuck my bullies i cant go back in the past i will always be like this i already missed on my youth its legit not fair,3
i generally like my therapist i think hes the best one ive found so far but todays session just proved that he doesnt understand and i admit that my inability to open up is a barrier to make much progress but i heard the same generic advicego out meet people do something fun and thats not bad advice probably should do that but the problem is every time i go out i feel anxious selfconscious and ashamed i dont even think i have social anxiety shy but not on that level i can handle brief infrequent surface level conversations anything more than that is a nogo so i seem more outgoing than i am and its like he focuses on my lack of relationships so thats what i bring up i think its because hes a solutionfocused therapist and he doesnt seem too concerned about the pastunderstanding ones self just do it pretty much cbt opposite of feeling action which is all true but honestly i isolate because im depressed which is why i dont maintain relationships or want to put myself out there so i dont know what to do i dont know what my problem is im just over it older seasoned avpders if thats a thing any advice for me should i stick therapy out or just forget it hes like the rd longterm ish therapist ive been with and i dont want to dump him out the blue like all the rest,3
i know i should just message should just talk to them but i feel paralyzed and afraid this sucks,3
does exposure therapy or testing your fears work for avpd my therapist is pushing me into exposure therapy i think i do have mild form of avpd since it does effect me i have anxiety issues and depression but it doesnt always keep me from doing something i try to get around it most times but when i have to i do it even though i feel anxious,3
i mean ive never been diagnosed cause im afraid of going to the psychiatrist and discovering im a real shit but this days i was doing a personality check from twitter just for the joke and the result avpd came so close home i felt offended i grew up always walking behind my group of friends i could never do anything apart from others in any social situation it has always been my role to be the child in the corner or the one following the parents it doesnt help my father is a controlling sexist ive never slept out my own house never dated someone openly afraid he would beat me up never visited my friends houses i dont even know if i can call them friends im nerdy but not smart i always got high grades in school but i never liked being complimented on it because i thought most of my grades came from the cheating sheets i made to remember the subjects before the exams if i have to talk with someone for anything i have a script in my head i have to follow to ensure im not saying anything idiot after graduating from school i fell for my relatives advice and did not leave my hometown preferring to go to college in the neighboring city and work with that relative well we had a fight and i had to quit uni cuz i was fired i couldnt muster up the strength to deliver resumes in my city due to sheer shyness five years have passed since then im almost years old im just a high school graduate no professional course taken no money in hand living with my parentsi still dont want to hand out resumes i dont want to get in touch with people i long for physical contact but i dont have the courage to get close to anyone so to you guys who suffer from avpd how do you cope with this shit how do you guys have strength to work sorry my thoughts were all over the place while i was writing so please forgive me if it sounds confusing,3
i dont know if my flair is correct idk last night around am she passed my sweet lilith i had her for a good years and she was a darling so sweet and kind jumpy and squeaky all up until the last couple days where she suddenly became so tired her last day came around and i just felt it she was so exhausted i tried to get her into my local vet yesterday but they said they didnt have time for her that day so we stuck it out hoping i would get her in today but there wasnt time i gave her as much water as she would take before she passed tried to feed her and mostly just talked to her and praised her and loved her i held her all night she hadnt eaten in a day already aside from the very few nibbles shed taken from what i tried to give her tomato was her favorite food so i brought her some tomato last night as she was on her last leg it was her last treat i was surprised she came running for it despite her exhaustion and she had a little nibble just a little i wanted her to have more but she was so tired and im glad she had even that everything seemed so much for her she snuggled with me in some of her last moments before i tucked her back in her cage where she felt safest and she passed i have friends but not very close ones anymore as ive isolated myself so much i feel very very alone and i dont know if theres anything else for me here i think theres probably not im so so tired and im ready to give up my parents are going away for the weekend and with the way things are lining up i wonder if now is the time i guess im just posting this to vent or maybe to have someone for a little bit or maybe a call for help or something i dont know but im so tired and sad and afraid and alone and im so over it all i want it to end so badly and idk im sorry i really am i just want it all to end i want it to be over so badly,3
i met him on vacation and we hung out for two days together at the swimming pool im a very socially anxious person but with him i felt like ive known him for years one night he told other teenagers that he liked me they all told me and they were hyping me up saying stuff like oh look your boyfriends here i was so excited i never had a guy like me before ever all my life i was treated as a freak so i was just glad for this opportunity for something special so i went up to him and asked him if he liked me he told me he had a girlfriend and got really mad at our friends for telling me he cut off all contact with with me after i blocked him on instagram after he rejected my instagram request i was so sad that the guy i liked decided it would be best if he never saw me again the one person who saw me for all the good i have to offer and he still gave it up they broke up two months later and he still looks at my social media were not in contact but according to my friend a playlist on his spotify was made as a birthday present to me but i dont forgive him ive never had the privilege of falling in love before and he just took it away from me how could we truly ever be in love when he didnt want me when he chose to let me fall into the abyss i trusted him i had confidence that he was a nice person and it was all a lie,3
i take online classes and only leave my house for therapy or medical appointments i am usually too afraid to talk to people online even in anonymous online spaces ive always been a loner but for about a year its been worse than ever literally zero friends the severe isolation has caused me to forget how to socialize and behave around other people i get so awkward and nervous and dont know how to carry on normal conversations even the dialogue in my writing is unnatural and weird i see people online and even in this sub who arent total loners and have friends or even partners how why is everything so hard for me why cant i just be normal and function like everyone else,3
no matter what social setting im in im always the odd one out i feel like i physically cant talk i only speak when someone initiates and even then the conversation just ends almost instantly cause of my bad social skills i wanna be normal and be able to make small talk and actually have relationships with people i feel so alone and i dont know how to change im and wish i could have friends and go out like other people my age was considering going to the disney college program but i know itll just be the same no friends and ill just be the weirdo everyone avoids please i really want to change my life i need some advice did medicine or therapy help any of you did anyone get better on their own a part of me just wants to be courageous and force myself to talk to people i know ill be unsuccessful but maybe ill get better with time,3
whats your aftercare after socialising if the interaction has been neutral or negative,3
my kid has been having issues with this teacher all year they really struggle with concentration and memory and the teacher has been terribly unsupportive its the only class my kid has been failing a few months ago my kid was diagnosed with cancer we set up a to reduce the amount of assignments and give them extended time they were then out of school for two weeks for surgery all of their teachers except the problem teacher followed the and greatly reduced the amount of their makeup assignments regardless my kid worked hard to turn in a large portion of the assignments yet theyre still failing that class i emailed the teacher today to make sure she graded all the assignments she told me she did but otherwise did not give me any helpful information in getting my childs grade up i then asked if she has been following the plan and ive not received a response ive already been second guessing whether i was too aggressive in my emails but at the same time i feel like im going to have to escalate it with the school im stressed and ive been fucking sick to my stomach all day im cycling between anger and embarrassment and im going nuts just needed to vent edited thank you everyone for your encouragement ive been in continued correspondence with the teacher she stated that she has already reduced the amount of work but i still have issue with the amount and content i also elaborated on the fact that my child has been having issues all year only in this class my child has told me theyre afraid of this teacher and they struggle with her teaching methods the teacher had no helpful comments and has only repeated that the issue is missing assignments as if i dont have eyes she also said she thinks they can turn this semester around if we can motivate them and thinks they are not having academic difficulties this rubs me the wrong way because motivation starts in the classroom and shes clearly been lacking pt conferences are tomorrow ill be talking with the principal,3
i dont know what to do in therapy we usually just sit there in silence as my therapist does grounding exercises saying things like notice the things around you your breaths all your senses etc to help with my anxiety and then she asks the dreaded question what do you want to work on today like hell if i know even when i do know i wont say it cause of my anxiety i told her about my anxiety and possible avpd which weve been learning about together even though its information i already know but honestly at least were doing something i want to get deep into my trauma my mentality my thought processes who i am just everything about what caused this hell but i feel like were getting nowhere because my therapist doesnt bring us anywhere its like asking a blind man for directions i tried telling her that i like it when she leads the conversation which she has been trying but in the end shes not leading enough i know in therapy a therapist shouldnt lead and let the patient control their session but honestly i just wish someone would ask me a bunch of very leading harsh to the point questions with no way out so i can talk about my feelings without feeling guilty and selfish or embarrassed ampxb i know nobody is probably going to answer but in the minuscule chance that you do you have my eternal thanks and appreciation,3
im and im going back to college soon im really afraid about the socialization part that comes with college i think i have avoided getting help for so long but i reached a point of crisis because i have no idea of who i am and hurted a person very badly wish me luck it really feels like a big step i want to say im proud of me for me doing this i have been scared but i hope i can improve,3
i feel bad for making another post here but i just want to see if anyone has experienced this and recovered i feel like being isolated and particularly avoidant over the last year has completely fried what little personality i had i think a mix of depression apathy and mental anguish from little human contact has left me as this husk of a person i was never good at connecting with people but now it seems impossible im so distant and just dont have it in me to feign excitement or interest during social interactions anymore im not sure how to work on things when im this robot with no substance to my character it makes every attempt to speak to someone strange and awkward it makes me feel like i have nothing to offer to another person in a conversation or interaction,3
i have wanted to dye my hair blonde for years and recently got out the mental hospital and decided to just go for it i made a hair consultation appointment and had to get the bus then walk a long way through town to get there saw loads of people around my age with friends socialising laughing it hurt so much then at the hairdresser being reminded im not normal as i try and fake being so for the consultation next week i have to sit an hour and minutes while they dye my hair why is socialising so difficult i hate leaving my house and being reminded of what i am,3
im leaving this weekend not telling anyone where im going and leaving my keys with a note explaining im okay and not to look for me changing my number and not giving it to anyone i suffer from really severe social anxiety to the point where i even isolated myself from my family i feel like i have nothing here no friends no job i messed up my relationship with my family by barely leaving my room they all think im awkward and weird it doesnt help ive become a pretty bitter and rude person over the last couple years because of how miserable i am in my life my fault i know feel like i have screwed my life up too much im an embarrassment and want to go where nobody will recognize me my mom was ashamed of me ever since i started being socially anxious around th grade she hated how quiet and unpopular i was she can also be very clingy overprotective and worried too much i cant handle it anymore i feel totally smothered i just want to get out on my own even if im living in my car for a while but i am starting to feel extremely guilty because i know shes going to freak out when she sees the note probably have a panic attack and call the whole family probably telling them im missing i feel like my parents do not trust me whatsoever and see me as some useless idiot that will never be able to have her own life im planning on alternating between motels sleeping in my car and working my way up to renting a room in someones house somewhere,3
im a senior in high school and after being on this subreddit for a month im terrified of going to college granted i was terrified before that before i figured id take a gap year to figure things out and i didnt feel like i was in a good position to do well in college but now im realizing i was just avoiding applying because i was scared to be rejected or maybe i was scared of what would happen if i was accepted i dont know what i want to get into and its scary how relatable a lot of these post feel and what scares me more is that i keep seeing posts about people having to tell their parents they dropped out of college is that going to be me am i just going to be a drop out should i even try i dont know but now im worried im going to get to comfortable once im out of school and will be too scared to return uuugh everything is so frustrating i wish i could just be normal and i dont know what to do but im curious to know other peoples experience with college,3
this is what my sister told to me mom said she wants to wrap her hands around your neck and strangle you or grab you and punch u in the face i have been debating how i could ever tell my family about dropping out of my degree it has been a horrible shame to carry last night i told them about my struggles i told them at length how i feel like i dont deserve anything even the air i breathe my last chance to try for understanding from them instead of shame and blame now i think ive made a horrific mistake,3
i came across this company that makes plushies off of disorders and other disabilities and there was one for avpd not sure how i feel i guess since its the first i see avpd incorporated anywhere lol just wanted to see you guys thoughts on this httpswwwinstagramcompcpclbvowhttpswwwinstagramcompcpclbvow,3
i am scared because i had to do something today but postponed it to tomorrow planning to wake up at am to do it but its pm already i had to send an email to a coworker explaining how far i reached in solving an issue so they can take over but i have made progress in it even though i took fucking weeks for it i also cant say that i didnt make any progress because i told my boss otherwise i just dont start my work itself because i am too scared to encounter new issues that i wont be able to solve procrastination is fucking me up i dont even know what or why i am typing i feel i just keep feeling sorry for myself and dont really do much to improve anyways i am preparing side by side for a career shift but i dont see how it would be much better as the issue mainly lies with me and everyone in my job are great people i just think way to hard on how to appear a certain way to others because i base my self worth on others opinion of me which i am trying to change but honestly dont see it getting much better i went to different psycologists and psychiatrists in the past but never sticked to any my mind kept finding reasons to not continue even tho some of the meds helped me at the time i will probably go to a therapist again thank you if you read so far i need friends who can understand my situation and want to get better too any resources links or advices you can offer for my situation are most welcome thank you again,3
ive had some people from this sub reach out to me in the past looking to chat but i just wasnt in the right frame of mind to do so i now have some more free time and would like to chat with some fellow avpders i find that no matter where im at with this disorder its always a comfort to know there are people out there who get it and id enjoy trying to support others on their journey with this pd dms open,3
hey guys everytime i get into a new relationship i self destruction with anxiety i lose myself lose ability to eat and sleep and get extreme anxiety last time i spoke to a girl that i really liked for days and as soon as i felt that she is the perfect one for me i went into severe anxiety and panic and just ghosted her im tired of this shit i havent been diagnosed yet but everytime its a new relationship and i like the person i self destruction and spiral into depression and i just ghost the person because i choose my sanity first,3
in the sense that since avoidance worked dealing with earlier trauma you just involuntarily and unaware start applying it on everything that causes fear,3
my mother has a drinking problem i dont have much contact with her as she ran away for drugs when i was a kid but have tried to be a part of her life now for a few years she was in rehab and were now a recovering alcoholic and drug addict but then she called me the other day very drunk and it hurt me so much and made me worried i sent a message to my family member who has the most contact with her where i said she was drinking again that i feel really sad and i dont know what to do feel helpless etc i also sent something similar to my grandpa because hes working with her she lives in a psychiatric apt now its been days and ive gotten no response i feel anxious and regret sending the messages they probably think i was on drugs or crazy for sending desperate messages like that and therefore not responding i want to unsend the messages but im not sure if that would be acceptable to do or look weirder if i do that im considering texting my grandpa something else after unsending but my other family member i dont know that well and cant really do that i realize i shouldnt text her again after this as its obvious she wants no contact and now ive embarrassed myself would you unsend in this situation or any other good advice sorry for the rant,3
okay lets keep it short i have had depressions since i was now mixed with social anxiety throughout my whole life currently in therapy trying to find out why i keep getting depressed without a trigger i thought about autism but i only have symptoms relating to social interaction so no sensory issues or interests and such my therapist mentioned personality problems not a disorder so i started looking in to it and i relate alot to avpd could i have avpd anyone else who thought it could be autism but it turned out to avpd info about avpd is welcome since im new to this,3
they say it really shows because i stutter and then get all quiet the longer i talk guess i just stop talking then or spew bs with confidence if thats what they want to hear,3
thankfully this person was not a close friend at all they were an acquaintance but god i feel so embarrassed that i never replied what must they think of me because we were only acquaintances this person literally wont miss me but its moreso the fact ive probably came across as extremely rude that is upsetting im not sure if i should just leave it now or if i should message and apologise and tell them i wont be replying anymore i should have done this aggges ago and told them that i wont be replying anymore instead of just avoiding for fucking weeks i think messaging to let them know what happened would be a good idea but i should have done it shes ago if i did it now i would feel so anxious about messaging them maybe they hate me now and dont want me to message them ever again idk guys edit i dont think i will message them because there isnt really any point the friendship is obviously over and i dont plan on trying to reignite it i wish i could but its too difficult i did briefly tell this person that i have issues with replying to people so im praying that they wont be mad at me and instead would have attributed my absence to this avpd makes life so complicated guys fr,3
theres a lot of people that have been nice to me people ive worked or went to school with that would talk to me or smile at me i wish i could thank them for being caring and generous enough to acknowledge me most people ignore me which i dont mind and some people bully me but i often think about the people that went out there way to be nice to me they would have got noting out of it they did it just to be nice maybe they could see i was shy and lonely and had pity for me so they would talk or smile or say good morning to me to make me feel like a human being even though people pitying me makes me feel embarrassed and small i appreciate it so much but im never able to show it so i just pray for them every day and hope they are having amazing lives and i hope they know they are angels,3
i discovered that i was bisexual a few years ago but recently i have been feeling like it is useless for me to even claim that identity because how am i going to be attracted by everyone but also feel unable to be intimately close to anyone and cant imagine myself in a successful relationship to me it feels like a useless discovery idk,3
i am trying to build a routine for my mental health and actually start using wellbeing apps however i noticed there are not a lot of resources or apps to treat severe social anxiety or avpd i know ideally this is not the best way to treat it but i have no medical benefits or insurance to cover for therapy as an international student atm what resources have worked for you guys,3
i get sad frequently big surprise and theres some shit going on in my life and it feels like i want to talk to someone but its really hard to open up i want to tell my partner about how im feeling because they should be a support but everytime im like whats the point i think sometimes i think too logically about situations and im like what are they gonna do at best they can say is sorry you feel that way and to be honest things like that arent really meaningful to me does anyone else struggle opening up to friendspartner i mean obviously we all have avpd so yes but do you guys have strategies,3
i do not have great social skills i am awkward and shy but i saw an ad for a job that helps adults with disabilities find and maintain employment i want to apply for it but it requires making connections with business owners and having good interpersonal skills this is just a vent about wanting things that are outside the realm of being a good idea,3
in my head i never think im going to make x years of age for example and its not because i specifically plan to do anything but i just kind of think ill probably be far too fed up of this misery at that point and end it and then that milestone age will come and itll then change to the next one that i cant imagine making it past,3
too late to fix your life and the mess you created,3
i know you dont go out often but when you do where are you what clubsinterest groups has the highest chance of having avpd people im trying to find my own kind looking for people like yourself thats pretty normal right,3
have you ever looked up and realized that months have passed without you even noticing and everything is moving around you time people events but youre just standing there staring at it and you realize just how much youve lost in this static state and now its just gone and its too late and you have to keep going time changes nothing and it waits for no one and leaving all these things up to time and opportunity was just another way to avoid being held accountable for my lack of action and now im here and now i have to deal with it and thats all itll ever be i hate that i control my life i dont want to i just want to leave or stop i just want everything to slow down theres so much i want to achieve and yet im just standing here staring at everyone else i want these things so badly i dont understand why i cant just do them it hurts so much time has passed that im scared this is all ill ever be,3
sorry if this is actually completely normal or offtopic basically i find myself so genuinely hideous in a you look too ridiculous to seriously expect anyone to acknowledge you as a fellow human being kind of way it doesnt just stop at my appearance either its literally every single facet of my being that is too ridiculous to ever be taken seriously it prevents me from talking to people finding a well paying job making friends of any kind doing literally anything out of the ordinary including necessary appointments like the doctor or even wanting to be alive the only person i see regularly now outside of work is my therapist who insists there isnt anything wrong with me as a person but i find it incredibly hard to believe he doesnt see just how unbelievably embarrassing and stupid i am this feeling causes me constant distress and is completely unshakeable even though i am aware of how logically silly it is and i worry it might mean i have a personality disorder because it handicaps every part of my life obviously no one on here can diagnose me but i guess i am wondering if it sounds similar to what you guys deal with,3
m my problem with avpd is that it made me weak defenseless i feel like prey living among predators my self esteem is low and i know how it can be increased it just requires me to be strong and all the problems will eventually disappear i was bullied by two different group of people i realize now the reason was that they instantly saw my weakness the second time i was bullied by my friends at that time initially they even respected me cause i was serious but when you cant defend yourself it looks pathetic and i even can see their perspective you just need to be more tough and confident without any reason this experience reflected in my thoughts i was living with till recently when i was a kid i thought you need to really know how to dance know the technique or some kind of particular style but thinking about my stupid rural relatives refuted it cause how they being so stupid could think about it really its not possible but they fuck i dont second was about clothes hypebeasts i thought classmates were making fun of me cause i looked weird lame even though its not fully wrong i just exaggerated it on a new extreme level there wasnt particularly anything wrong with my clothes i just couldnt understand their reaction third was about thinking that the group of people knew something that i missed or like there was some hidden context i was unaware of it was a constant thought when i was with my peers i also has such problem that i often cant decide when i should feel offended and when not its important cause it can really lead to being a punching bag this is also a beginning of my ppd part of personality this kind of thinking leads to paranoia i hope i wont regret posting this maybe its the only time i can be honest,3
ive been thinking recently that most of my friendships have a pattern its always the other person sharing things about their life and me listening to them or consoling them or whatever i dont know if the friends ive had have been bad listeners but it feels like whenever i try to share something about myself with people it kind of dies down and gets lost in time how do i not play the role of a therapist in the relationships i form im getting tired of this but also i dont know how to convey it to other people in a way that wont result in permanent damage,3
when covid hit i became very isolated since i was doing school online but last school year i went back in person and there was this person that would approach me but i was too shy to really talk to him and i finally built up the courage this last september to actually approach him ive gotten really close with him and i am so fuckin glad i befriended him hes really loving kind and patient hes assertive out there and also very protective while im very quiet meek and also generally on edge and easily spooked so he balances me out and calms me very well i can tell he cares very deeply about me and hes accepting of my differences i told him about my avpd and he has been very understanding and helpful his attitude and actions have given me a really big confidence boost in our friendship and just in general i feel a lot more comfortable just existing and taking up space even tho i still struggle a lot having a supportive and caring friend has helped me tremendously and im planning to keep him around for a very long time,3
i mean i do have various have mental issues but i think chronic isolation in particular is a big part of why im growing into such a bitter and hateful person objectively its not really much of a problem because im alone all the time so its not like im being actively hateful or offensive towards others but yeah basically it seems that whenever i hear sth concerning other people be it celebrities or strangers on the internet or whatever i am either jealous or upset these are my only reactions i dont empathise anymore its kinda starting to affect my beliefs as well but im aware that its more of an emotional issue than anything and i dont plan on being alive for much longer so no need to worry about that,3
unfortunately i dont really have someone i can tell this so this will be my venting space right now the only thing currently holding me alive is my family if they didnt care and love me i would have kms years ago but now i really wish theyd just abandon me and stop caring because i really dont want to live anymore really i hate to say this but their love just makes it worse what do i owe them but yeah the thought of how theyd react if i did it is so bad that it currently holds me back i do have friends but they either never reach out to me or if they do its in a context of meeting as a group and that happens like times a year some of those people do stuff together i came to know but not once was i asked to join and i have a best friend whos just weird idk why i even call him my best friend maybe because i know him since years and we did stuff together he as well never reaches out by himself and when i do almost always declines is busy on those rare occasions we meet i never get asked a question no one ever showed interest in me besides my ex girlfriend but thats another story i dont really have a perspective because i was lazy struggled in school as a teen i hold a diploma which is almost useless cant study but dont want to do the soul crushing labor i did before if i want to change something about my situation i would need to put in tons of effort but my batterys empty i cant charge it no more and no one gives me a new one,3
i havent been around anyone outside of my family in two weeks and im really content with it for the first time in a while i dont feel this overwhelming sense of loneliness because theres nothing to compare myself to i dont have to worry about being asked about myself or being expected to be social i like it this way i dont know what this means though im dreading having to go back to class next week because everything i want to avoid comes back im tired of the pressure that my lack of social skills and low self esteem brings no ones looking at me and judging im not constantly thinking i look awkward and shifting in my chair to look as normal as possible i can breathefor once no default answers to questions no fake laughs just me i know i cant stay in this shell foreverbut i like it here,3
its all coming to a boiling point my mother says you need to go into what you need to do for graduation or if you are not doing the ceremony then please be kind enough to tell me now of course ive known for months that graduation is not happening im too afraid to tell them and admit im so sick ive been lying the whole time and i feel disgusting but even if im too afraid to tell them they will know eventually theres either a ceremony to attend or theres not and come to their own conclusions of me they are extremely abusive people and i know they are going to shame me severely they are the reason i even have this disorder in the first place and now i have no choice but to sit there and let them blame and shame me for having it i cant handle living alone right now or being completely by myself i feel i have no choice but to throw myself into the flames and let any confidence i had left burn away pain is the only option i have on all sides i dont know how to deal with any of this,3
i honestly hate my life i think everything sucks and nobody is cool i dont have any friends i have people i can occasionally speak to once a week sure but i dont have any friends i dont even call my boyfriend half the time so i just constantly feel like im in some sort of simulation i cant make friends because my autism greatly impedes how likeable i seem and the only people who do pay attention to me are guys that wanna fuck me because im attractive so i end up speaking to no one i just hate it here,3
hi im m new to to this subreddit and also to reddit i am not diagnosed with avpd so far but i am able to relate to almost all the posts here my parents are loving but the rest of the family on my dads side is fucked up my dad and his siblings are all suffering from some or the other disorder not all are diagnosed though because no one takes mental health seriously in my family everyones super selfcentred to the core but it is the exact opposite on my moms side all of my moms siblings cousins and their kids get along great while i feel like an outsider i was terribly bullied in middle school because i reflected the behaviour i saw back at home also because i had started watching porn this went on for a few years i learnt to build a shell around my myself to prevent people from seeing my true self this shell has hardened to such an extent that nobody i repeat nobody has access to the person within i have since been the mature kid in school and focussed primarily on academics i made it to one of the best universities in my home country a couple of years into university i realised that i had a lot of friends but there was no one i could truly call a close friend no one knew anything about me i collaborated with a lot of people both academically and in extracurricular activities but never got close enough to anyone at that time i didnt think much of it mainly because i was doing well according to the norm i bagged some great internships and a wellpaying job right out of college interestingly this did not seem to affect my job i performed exceptionally well and received great reviews both in the technical and interpersonal front but as you might have guessed it already no one knew me out of work again i ignored this and remained focussed on my work then i decided to go for a masters and got accepted into one of the top graduate schools in the us i have completed a term here i started noticing this problem again during my first term after meeting and talking to people its not like i cant come up with things to talk about but everything seems very superficial there is no intimacy in any of the conversations also it feels like people behave differently when they talk to me i am not really interested in peoples life and it is extremely exhausting to pretend otherwise whats sad is that from the outside it looks as though im doing great and living the best life there are people that look up to me and dream to achieve what i have achieved but no one knows the truth not even my parents this post is the most candid i have ever been in my life i dont reveal anything about myself to anyone i have never been in a relationship and at this rate im afraid i will never be i want to turn my life around before its too late im not sure how my family would react to therapy i dont have enough money to fund it myself to end this vent the details i have added in this post are not intended for bragging i totally understand that people have suffered worse those are just to emphasize what an absolutely perfect twosided mess my life has become,3
does anyone else realize how much they lie to themselves and other people i always rationalize it because i sometimes do it to protect my feelings or others feelings but that doesnt make it any less wrong or cowardly,3
honestly what is the point im so sick of people going on about how much they wish they didnt miss out on things when they were younger i just dont care anymore i spent a whole monthes bulling myself to do things out of existential fear and im so exhausted i want to do nothing ever again im so tired what is even the point if you get better your just going to be left as nothing but a empty shell or worse youll become one of them i just want to have my joker moment completely self destruct and then die,3
i am in a relationship that i have wanted out of for the last idk how long i cant break up with him i have three times and every time weve gotten back together within hours i love him and i keep getting back with him but i just dont want to be with him anymore ive already posted about this here before since that post i did take everyones advice and break up with him but i didnt block him on everything and we ended up getting back together literally the next day why am i like this what is wrong with me we have had a messy relationship to say the least and despite how its not as messy anymore i just dont want to be with him but i love him so much when im with him i dont actually want to leave him i know if i break up with him i will regret it eventually i know if i break up with him again it will break his heart when were talking everything is fine we rarely fight anymore and he does everything he can to resolve issues now because i know hes scared im going to break up with him again that makes me feel bad and also want to stay with him its a cycle of this i just cant be real with him i cant be normal with him i cant be honest with him i am a bad person its like i want to be unhappy,3
i feel like i cannot move forward with my life until i right my wrongs and reach out to people i know ive hurt from ghosting i wrote a letter ill never send mainly for my own benefit with way too much information about my life and my struggles but it seems way too intense to actually send out i feel ready to take the next step of actually making contact but i just dont know how much information to give is a simple apology sufficient this might be the avpd talking but i worry that by giving too much information ill come off like im trying to justify the pain ive caused i also dread the fact that theyll know how sad my life is but that cannot be avoided i guess for those who have done it successfully any tips,3
ill admit ive been guilty of this many times myself i dont know why i always feel shame even though its anonymous as a reader ive never once regretted reading something where it felt like someone put a part of themselves into words i dont know why the same logic doesnt carry over when youre the writer i wish i could tell them that i thought they had something valuable to say reading your words made me feel connected there are more people out there reading than you think you deserve to be heard,3
idk how else i could explain this but i often feel like people are trying their hardest to be gentle welcoming and polite when theyre internally wishing i never engaged with them in the first place people always treat me so weirdly that i just have my alarm beeping all the time and i have to actively switch it off because i cannot tell anymore whats fake positive and whats actually a true warning guess ill give up the social stuff and just stick to loneliness feeling like a stray dog around normal people is the most painful feeling ever,3
ive been focusing on identifying people i truly personally like in therapy or well more like validating my own opinions but it always comes back to people i have a net of people im really close with because of the way my uni living was set up and im realizing through a lot of questions that there are people i just dont actually like im surrounding myself with or people i want to interact with more that i know will make me happier compared to my current friend group but i cant help but think that anybody i would actually enjoy talking to couldnt possibly like me as a result i think its become a selffulfilling prophecy the more i criticise myself the more i pull back the less i interact with people and the world and the less worthy i am but the flavor of people i enjoy are the hardworking driven nice ones they wouldnt gossip about me behind my back nobody cares enough to do that but i would feel like such a charity case when im doing okay its okay when im not i hate the thought that im forcing my prescense on these people that my attention to turned towards how shitty and empty i feel all the time and not the other spicy things that give life flavor,3
so my ftm coworker evilyn f was going to see a band at a music venue an hour away she posted to her instagram story about needing a ride i offered to take her because i want to get out of the house she said shed be down and now im just waiting for her to respond so we can plan stuff on sc she mentioned having extra tickets but im still buying my own because she didnt directly offer it to me and i dont want to embarrass myself in case its not implied theyre like each so its not outlandish or anything and im too afraid to ask to clarify like so if im going too would you give me one of your extra tickets its not unreasonable i know if i were her i wouldnt mind the question but id feel like a terrible person for asking even if we were closer also not going to clarify that this is platonic because were coworkers and i think she knows im gay the one thing i miss about presenting female is that i never had to make those distinctions with other girls but will live in fear of that misunderstanding nonetheless another fear evilyn is on pretty friendly terms with jonah m our other coworker a the one and only person ive ever romantically pursued lots to unpack with that but for brevitys sake lets not as in theyve hung out outside of work more than once now i dont think jonah is the petty type but if evilyn mentions it to him i wouldnt put it past him to say something idk what but not sure he likes me much at the moment that would make her back out and if that were the case shed just make an excuse so i would never really know rambling post but i wanted to talk about my fears somewhere this is the closest i will get to feeling hyped about hanging out with someone mainly in my own head i have to earn outings by going over everything that could go wrong and by being of use ie giving her a ride without expecting a free ticket yeeeah its a lot thanks for reading all,3
i dont mean personal hygiene like avoiding skincare not caring abt your hair dressing as baggy and blandly as possible not doing makeup i just desperately dont want any attention i dont want girls to comment anything about my cute outfit i dont want men to stare at me i want to be invisible,3
hi from what i can gather about depressive personality disorder is its a lot like avpd but i cant seem to find out much about treatment for it or if it is even treatable i took the mcmi iii and scored is as high as it goes have avpd dpd and masochistic traits as well but they seem to be coming down any information about this would be really helpful i would really like to not have depression all my life thanks in advance,3
why dont you just like stop worrying and act normal s,3
this is actually so sad but i remember one time in high school i bought donuts for no reason and gave them away to people i was friends with just because for no reason i also did the same thing with smoothies once spent at tropical smoothie amp at powderpuff practice did the same thing with slurpees desperate much,3

i dont know if this has anything to do with avpd or not im years old and i think i suffer from avpd u can check my other posts here this is a problem i noticed recently lets say im talking to someone and if shehe calls me by my name i feel extremely uncomfortable i feel like i did something wrong so i dont want to talk anymore and end the conversation there it happens both in real life and online if someone says my name its a big turn off for me normally people dont even know my name people in my class etc they dont use my name at all i just wonder is there anyone here in the same situation,3
im a year old female and i never developed my own personality i also suspect i have autism because i did a lot of research and i just know my brain is wired differently i cant hold friendships and i hurt them because i keep them on a distance they cant help me and see mee struggling and getting in abusive relationships because my self esteem is so low because of this i have a lot of traumas when i was a kid i was neglected by my parents because they were addicts i lived in a psychiatrical hospital for a long time cause i tried to commit suicide it wasnt a serious attempt i just didnt know how to get out of the situation anyway im now and ive learned a lot so far between my i did a lot of drugs and i felt normal i felt like people wanted to be friends with me because i was social and talkative and not scared at all but deep down i knew it was fake the friendships i build were fake i tried for so many years to adapt myself to others just to fit in and next to that i was in an abusive relationship i was paranoid and stressed always scared theyd find out the real me and i did this for so long i dont even remember who i am right now i am depressed diagnosed with ptsd avpd and traits of borderline disorder i asked for a psychological diagnosis for autism but they didnt think i have enough traits to fit the criteria i dont really care about labels but i feel like there is something really wrong with me im an alien in this world it feels so alone sorry for the long text im prone to addiction and im addicted to xanax right now i get admitted to a rehab clinic this friday for nights and then straight after that to portugal for intense therapy im glad to have this opportunity and ill definitely get out of my comfort zone i know they wont fix my problems but itll hopefully give me the push i need to work hard cause i do believe i can find out who i am and make real friends without being fake i have hope and i want you to have it too were all different with different stories but the one thing that is so important getting out of your comfort zone do things that are scary take baby steps dont set the bar too high for yourself everyone is different so you cant compare yourself to others good luck everyone and just keep swimming,3
a friend of mine was talking to me about my family situation and i told him about how i wanted to put distance between me and them he said that he might have some ideas and that we could work something out ive been in a new place now for five days i have a roommate he is cool his work keeps me from seeing him very much so i only have to deal with other people in small doses the best thing is that im finally away from my relatives it always feels weird when i say i miss you too over the phone because i dont miss them at all im so happy to finally be freed of them people do keep telling me that its natural for me to feel this way and that ill miss them eventually but i dont want to miss them i had to go back earlier today to pick up some of my stuff but i dreaded seeing anyone there i left as soon as i could and i guess i just dont know how to feel now i still love them i never didnt love my relatives but i know theyre not good for me i am much better on my own i guess i just feel guilty like i owe them something part of me wants to go back and try to fix them but i have to keep reminding myself that i cant do that and that theyre not my responsibility so im determined to not go back for as long as possible the only reason id go back now is to get my bike but i can be without that for a while otherwise im done belonging to them i am my own person now and im slowly getting to like who im becoming i definitely still have many times where i hate myself for messing something up or blaming myself for something that cant be helped or just wasnt my fault but overall things are getting better and me leaving my relatives behind is just one of many steps in the right direction,3
ive been telling my therapist that ive wanted to go to church for a while the last time i went was last easter so today i pushed myself to go with gods help but i didnt really enjoy it i felt selfconscious during worship i couldnt get outside my own head when the service was over i just left while most people stayed to mingle being around a lot of people makes it worse most people go to church in families not all but i couldnt walk up to another person who came alone out of fear then i went to the park which was another mistake seeing all the children and couples enjoying themselves was too much no one goes alone to the park on sundays so i tried not to isolate but it was too painful and now i want to isolate again im so useless,3
i have anxiety disorders one being social anxiety so i experience a lot of anxiety with my avpd when it comes to social situations my anxiety is so high that im sweating heart is pounding and it feels like my brain shuts down completely it causes me to fail so badly at socializing even more than i already would it doesnt give me time to hear what people are saying or to give myself the time to think of a response its embarrassing how i react internally cause it causes me to react externally in a way i wouldnt want to id like my brain to be calm and relaxed so that i can properly think of my reactions and responses but nope i end up looking like a fool which leads to more self hate and feelings of ineptness does anyone have experiences like this,3
i dont know if this is avpd but its like i cant make decisions for myself based on what i want or even if someone needs me to do something i constantly ask for reassurance im doing it correctly if i dont feel totally confident ill just sit there and wait till i can ask i unironically use dice rolling and stuff to make decisions for me so i can kind of appear neutral always almost like a scapegoat so if people dont like it i can just say i didnt really make the choice i just feel so terrified of making the wrong choice all the time sorry if wrong place or if i put it badly but this has really affected me as far back as i can remember,3
ive always been selfless i put everyone first and i dont give myself the time of day for nearly anything there have only been a few times where ive stood up and tried to prioritize myself and it always ended in a dumpster fire i always get put down by others and myself i feel like the universe is trying to punish me for trying to care about myself ive been looking into what i want to do career wise and im leaning towards my dream job and becoming a mortician ive never told anyone about my interest in the job because i know people will be very judging about it i was talking to my mom earlier about career stuff and i got brave enough and told her about it you can probably guess how she reacted but she didnt nearly react as harsh enough as my dad did he walked into the room as we were talking and mom looked at him and went she wants to be a mortician he instantly stopped moving and stared at me for whole minutes with this absolute disgust on his face he already made me feel like a disappointment without him opening his mouth yet after what seemed like an eternity he said in a low and disgusted tone youre kidding me then slowly turn around and walked away like i pissed him off or something people have reacted in that similar fashion to a lot of my interests i know that field of work is looked in a taboo way by some people but i havent had such an unsettling judgmental self esteem killing reaction like that in a while i dont know why it hit me as hard as it has but it did how am i going to be able to function if i cant handle people reacting about what my passions are like that every time i try to climb out of this abyss i get hit with the tiniest pebble of judgment and it causes me to lose my grip and fall down deeper than i was before and the cycle just continues i feel so stupid thinking i could pull it off i actually thought i could go into a job like this im honestly giving up im just going to stick to what im good at most of the time and just stay quiet im never gonna get anywhere in life without avpd reminding me that all im good at is telling people what they want to hear and stay in my room,3
it seems like no matter how tired i am whenever i go to bed i just lay there thinking about hypothetical situations that are unlikely to ever happen generally itll be fantasies for lack of a better word about potential relationship situations or generally sometimes just social situations and its absolutely ruining my ability to sleep im distracting myself with other things for hours just in an effort to be too tired to fantasise but it happens anyway and my sleeping pattern is being ruined because of it anyone do the same or any advice on how to ease off on this,3
i want more than anything to have connections and close friends but at the same time im scared of anyone getting to know me i get so remorseful of the fact know one really knows me or gotten to know me properly and ive never felt like i could be my full self around anyone and its all my own fault i feel like im not good enough to have friends or acquaintances whenever people talk to me or give me the time of day i feel like theyre just doing it out of pity or theyre just talking to me so they can laugh at me to feel better about themselves,3
i used to have dreams about becoming this or that but now that im an adult i find that the main thing im working towards is being normal anyone know what i mean,3
does anyone think their mother or father has avpd i am pretty sure my dad has it i see little signs here and there sometimes and just what ive been told as well he has a hard time finding a real job until he was by real job i dont mean anything fancy i just mean fulltime steady work he had a hard time asking store clerks where an item was located when i asked him how he overcame his extreme shyness he replied that my mom bossed out it out of him she has introverts in her family but they can be loud and opinionated as well my dad will talk on the phone when necessary but would never have a hour phone call just for the sake of it there is just other signs here and there ampxb have you seen any signs in your mom or dad or other relatives i know theres a genetic component and you mix that with environment and boom you get to deal with this lovely disorder,3
for those who feel they may not have avpd because they feel apathetic towards socializing its possible that apathy is not the starting point but what someone comes to its not just a reaction its a protection,3
i have am currently in my final year of med school and am right now i havent been in any relationships yet and am still a virgin even though all my friends are in relationships or having flings and i feel really horrible about it years ago i was sad that i didnt even have a social life in college but luckily i found a good small group of friends but my love life in college has just been a series of unrequited loves which has left me anxious and hurt for most of my college life i feel major fomo and maybe that im unlovable as a person and i sometimes make peace with that but hearing my friends have romantic or sexual experiences really makes me feel shitty again i feel really happy for my friends and even give them advice when ask me for it although idk why they ask me lmao but i dont know what to anymore and if this will stay this way forever,3
i avoid literally everything and it made me feel like nonexistence i just exist and im used to it why am i still living whats my purpose im fad up,3
im sure im not alone with this problem but ive been feeling this way for so long i dont even understand how healthy people avoid these feelings lets say an attractive girl posts hot pictures on social media i believe its natural that this sort of content sparks great desire in any guy i think its also safe to say that of guys will never have a chance with a girl like that so id say it should be normal for these guys to feel some resentment unfulfillment jealousy sadness selfdoubt etc this isnt however what im observing in reality generally these kind of content on social media receives countless upvotes and praise from guys can someone explain where is my reasoning flawed,3
the thing is i long have realized i am the problem but i dont want to bother people anymore with my problems my avpd is becoming so much worse five months into my first job i just dont want to bother people yet people keep talking sht about me its justified because i keep making the mistakes i shouldnt and i feel stupid alone and nervous all the time i thought about just trying to smile and improve even though my job is tough i thought if i pushed through it would be okay at the very least my co workers were nice my supervisor doesnt like me but im getting more and more tired its like the longer i stay the more my anxiety and depression flares up again i keep avoiding people for no reason trying to be alone in a workplace where theres tons of people when people look my way i get so scared of what they are thinking my hands begin to shake when i do tasks now its quite silly because the only reason i am anxious is because of my own incompetence i just think at this point it would be better if i just leave once my department hires new employees tldr silly rant because im dumb amp hate my job,3
i m have a rep in my friendgroup as being a great guy who refuses to date in truth i kind of get off on feeling like im withholding an ability or skill from someone i enjoy the image of people being jaded that theres no good guys left and that i am present could be an amazing boyfriend but am uniquely against beingacting that way and it making them sad if that makes sense i grew up in a family very withholding of affection it was very conditional so i think i learned to reverse that in a weird powerplay in a way i know its not a good thing because i do like the idea of being in a relationship but enjoy the rush of having a skillability to be warm that is kept from the outside world,3
hoping to spread some positivity ive spent so long thinking theres something wrong with me and constantly questioning why i cant just find things as easy as everyone else seems to do why i cant just be normal learning about social anxiety was a help but even then it was like it cant just be that though and then thinking i must be autistic or have adhd in some regard but never really feeling like i fit into those things to actually have a name for it and relate to so much of what people post on here its kind of a relief to know that theres some reason that im actually like this and just knowing that this is why i wont use it as an excuse and im going to fight against its tendencies as much as i can but im just glad that i finally understand now i appreciate you all being here,3
i know i should get my shit together but to be honest i am too much of a coward to do so i thought maybe with age i will try to turn things around out of desperation but despair made things even worse i feel more paralyzed than ever in fact i wish i had some incurable disease i want to die,3
does anyone else have zero interest in life im kind of done but assisted suicide has been delayed another year in canada who knew killing yourself was so difficult im not necessarily sad about dying but life is kind of pointless in my eyes im too much of a coward and squeamish to do it any other way i wish i could travel and do it abroad but i cant leave at the moment,3
i have spent a lot of time thinking about how i ended up with this disorder constantly reviewing and analyzing my past memories trying to find and pinpoint the exact event that caused me to be this way i wasnt sure i had one and i still think it may be multiple events in my life that led to the development of this disorder but for me i think the formation of my avpd has always been interlinked with my sexuality i am gay and hispanic growing up in a mexican household parents are not accepting of that whatsoever anyways i remember i still remember this time where i was looking up basically dick pics and i didnt delete the search history i was at the time and was barely discovering porn my mom checked it before any of us got home and while she was at work later she called my dad and told him about what she found my dad told me that she was crying because she couldnt accept that her son might be gay i explained it away to my dad that i was just checking to see how i sized up to other boys my age but i sorta knew what i was doing i guess that moment was pretty scary to me knowing not even my own parents would accept me and so i hid myself for a long time pretending to be straight year after year it just got harder every year to put on the mask and still now at the age of i have never told anyone in my personal life that im gay not like they dont know it or highly suspect it even though i present myself more masculine ive never had a girlfriend so i think its pretty obvious to everyone but anyways i think it was very much so having to do with moments like i first mentioned where i was scared and felt completely alone i guess it would have changed everything to have someone to tell me its ok and that theres nothing wrong with me and that im loved just the same but i didnt get that i just learned from an early age that i was different and so i would be treated differently unless i hid it,3
i very recently got diagnosed days ago with avpd after years and years and years of thinking that i just have very stubborn type of social phobiasocial anxiety i met with a specialist who really dug through my health records and diagnoses and even read through the psycological evaluation tests i went through over an year ago several times she was very firm and sure that i indeed have this disorder instead of the one ive been getting treatment on and it all stems from me hard schoollife i had to go through but instead my home life was always good very loving and caring parents and i love them so so much they made sure me and my brother always had food clean clothes and a warm home to live in we were poor but still happy my self esteem and self worth got destroyed from very young age by other kids its also very hard to trust people im worthless and like a ghost to others at times without digging deeper to the trauma ive faced in school ive just been existing and surviving from the young age to the s im still very broken unemployed depressed too but i go to therapy and have medication ive medicated myself with alcohol earlier years but stopped when i started antidepressants i still do self harm too as a coping mechanism which im not proud at all i very much hate and regret that i ever started dabbling to that habit in my young days is there really something good about this personality disorder can i ever learn to live with it in the way it wont make me isolate myself from others and fear other people i dont know i have a lot of doubts even when i am in a treatment and path to somekind of recovery is it even possible to meet new people and form a romantic relationship too yes im single been for the last years and sometimes its eating me from the inside to the point i feel physical pain i crave human touch nonsexual and sexual and sometimes im at the point that even a single friendly hug would make me cry yes i am lonely luckily i have a small friend group very small and two closest people out of this group are a couple so naturally they dont always have time for friends which i naturally understand they have their own things and struggles too its just life when i told two other friends about this new diagnosis i got they do know about my mental health struggles well they just were very silent and one of them answered with words in the way of oh i see and thats all it did kinda hurt does that make me a badattention seeking person for wanting even just a little bit of undersanding whats causing me to behave some way i dont always even realise im doing it heck this is kinda one messy message but i just have so many things going in my head now and i dont have any answers to give for myself ive always wanted to solve problems by myself but this is just too big of a thing for my brain to fully understand and i almost deleted this text and didnt want to post im sorry if i sound all whiny i just have so many questions and im sure there could be even more of them im not even sure if the flair is correct,3
if i say that i am a worthless subhuman most people will react by saying something like everyone has intrinsic value and that you dont need society or other people to validate your existence and while it may be theoretically true its also easy and generic what is difficult is to feel that you actually have value when such a big part of your life has passed without anyone seeing that value in you im not a bad person but frankly im barely a person im unable to do the majority of things most people do i lack any semblance of personality people forget about me and thats totally reasonable everyone likes me but not really no one cares about me or is really interested in me i have acquired major schizoid traits throughout the years to the point that sometimes im not sure if i need human connection anymore but i find myself craving external validation if theres no one there to believe that you matter do you really the obvious answer is yes but im not so sure anymore,3
none of my family knows that im lonely and struggle talking to people they do ask me how ive been and how university is going but i always insist things are going fine and that ive made friends i wish it didnt come to me lying to them but i guess thats better than them being worried sick at the reality of the way i am,3
m my life so far is a huge disappointment i have so many regrets wasted my youth got no job now no friends a virgin with erectile dysfunction due to meds i dunno what am i doing being alive at this point i knew few people who had their lives together but deaths took em outta nowhere i feel i should be the one dead that would have been a huge relief,3
i saw some article about how being lonely and isolated can increase selfcentered thoughts and behaviors i didnt realize i had this problem until recently i feel so awful about myself right now i didnt know it was such an issue until my partner wanted to leave me for it and he still might i wouldnt blame him has anyone else had this come up,3
i dont know if this is an avpd thing or not but does anybody else here mostly dont speak as much during conversations because your brain just goes completely blank i frequently find myself at conversations most of them tbh where i want to talk and engage but i just dont know what to respond at all i catch myself saying a lot of mmm yeah its true i agree but not something substancial you know sometimes i even repeat words just to use more time like yeah yeah meanwhile when i observe the way other people talk is like they always have something to say some comment to make or something to keep the conversation going and it seems so natural for them i always get afraid that people will like other people more because they can offer more during a conversation than i can and honestly i think this has been proven true over time some time ago i created a personal system to help me fill up silences and some of the things i set myself to do at these moments where just think out loud without filtering so much i read somewhere that one of the differences between extroverts and introverts is that the first ones sometimes think with their mouths while introverts think first then decide if its worth sharing and for us with avpd andor sad we mostly decide it is not and look for a subject connection even if its minimal then be like this reminds me of and keep going about it when i observe other people interacting i can see them using these a lot naturally i feel like a robot because i had to sit down and actually think to came up with these and have to make an effort to put them in practice but even with this system im still having problems because like i said a lot of times i simply cant think of anything i dont know if this is some kind of freeze response to the danger of socialization or if my brain is just socially dumb lol,3
is anyone else just a total fucking mess when they get drunk like it starts out fine and fun and the more you drink you just turn into a loud mean annoying over confident horrible person,3
im in love with someone wavpd due to my pattern of getting attracted to emotionally unavailable people which made me commonly feel unrecognizedunvalued in past relationships however i want to tell you people that there are a lot of different ways people show love and can feel loved and it varies from person to person now i need advice from you folks ive confessed to my person the response to it was idk if i feel the same i need to look within but its kind of blurry we were cuddling so i see it as a indicator but i feel that its difficult im scared of coming too strong there but not setting frames around it makes me also feel insecure should i try to look at it like a plain opportunity for my person with avpd to the experience of cuddling because i know you folks may have trouble forming trust within possible romantic relationships and that it may take a lot longer how ever forming a relationship out of it would take a lot effort and patience and willingness equally of both at the bottom line transparent communication is always necessary i think wish me and your avpd comrade luck,3
i dont mean to sound conceited or anything but being pretty isnt all its cut out for i know im perceived by others as being conventionally attractive but sometimes i feel like it isolates me even more theres nothing but a void inside this empty shell of a person but nobody ever thinks i would feel this way because of the way i look nobody thinks that someone like me could hate themselves so deeply nobody thinks someone like me would need help or be this fucked up people probably think im a bitch in real life when they try to talk to me but i genuinely just dont know how to respond or have a genuine conversation the answers i do give are bland and the words that come out of my mouth arent the ones i actually wanted to say i probably come off as rude or disinterested when i dont mean to and it pushes people away because they think im stuck up or think im better than them i feel like a doll trying her best to mimic the people around her something people like to look at sometimes but then inevitably get bored with and cast aside anyways sorry if this seems like im vying for attention with this but i just wanted to give a different perspective lonely pretty girls are more common than you think,3
like is it worth living in a life full of fear avoidance and all that in the end i mean there is no cure really isnt it at least i personally cant see myself living like this forever tbh,3
i m am not a romantic affectionate person by any stretch of the words im definitely cold and aloof at least outwardly especially around women i actually like and am attracted to so flirting just feels like i have to put on a super uncomfortable act pretend to be someone im not i dont like it or want to do it although i havent experienced a romantic relationship yet i like the idea of it i just cant stand the process enough to make it worth it idk if anyone else has felt this way or has any advice or could relate,3
theres some research about handedness and mental health probably silly and not a thing but curious about it with avpd view pollhttpswwwredditcompollhuot,3
i want to know if any of you have had this experience ever since i was a child a pattern has been that i am verbally offered support and love but when it matters and when i reach out for it it would be rescinded as a kid i blamed myself and turned inward as an adult if i fall for an insincere invite for connection or help i feel humiliated and angry with them and myself i realize this has made me extra sensitive and i even expect to be rejected it is extremely hard now to ask for help when someone burns me i dont think i will ever trust them againhard stop when someone comes through i feel completely overwhelmed with gratitude im not even sure of the word for the emotion of that im crying as i write this i think my expectations are too black and white but i dont know how to be change other than to keep giving people chances,3
my family is a very tough love type of family as far back as i can remember my parents and sister have tried to get me to change my bad wayshabits through tough love but all the problems they would try to use it for are still with me so it clearly has never worked just as an example of what i mean my dad would give me tough love in the form of telling me no one would ever want to be my friend or hire me if i continued to be a fat slob true and the other week my sister came over to the apartment and told me that i wasnt being cute or quirky by almost never cleaning im an adult and need to start acting like one it is extremely embarrassing at this point etc also true but even though i know these things are true hearing people phrase it like hard truths im just too dense to grasp doesnt make me want to change for the better it makes me want to go home put a gun in my mouth and pull the trigger because to my family i come off as such a complete moron that they need to tell me obvious shit i already know i am wondering if this type of tough love is actually helpful for anyone especially people with avpd because in my experience hearing people judge me like that just drives me to start spiraling down its like it really does solidify the fact that i am so worthless compared to actual human beings that they always have to talk down to me and my relationship with others always has to be me getting scolded even well into my adult years but everyone keeps touting tough love as if its some magic cureall that will make someone instantly snap out of whatever undesireable thing theyre doing,3
how does it evolve with age i honestly feel despair when thinking about the future because deep down i know its not going to get better but id like to hear experiences from actually older people older as but even may feel useful plus anyone recovered is it even truly possible to fully recover,3
i suffered from severe avpd from my late teens into my early twenties during this time i cut off my old school friends and then didnt go to uni in fact i pretty much became a recluse i eventually started to recover when i was about im now in my late twenties and though i feel ive overcome most avpd symptoms i feel like i am too old to make new friends ive managed to sort of reconnect with school friends but there was a five year gap in communication so things feel different i really feel like i wouldve made my lifelong friends at uni but i didnt make it there i dont know how to accept the damage that isolating myself during those critical years has done as ive recovered from avpd ive realised im not that weird of a person and i can actually get on with people fine but those friend making opportunities of school and uni have long passed it now feels like no matter how sociable or cool or fun i am it doesnt matter because everyone already has established friends from school or uni and doesnt want anymore has anyone else experienced this recovered but just too late the damage is done,3
i left college because i wasnt passionate about what i studied and because how much stress i felt of not being socially competent to fulfill a social focused related major and im here again i dont have much time too choose a major and to go back to college my parents have told me this is my last opportunity and limit time but im not sure if they would actually follow this through i dont think they would but i could be wrong all my interests and passions are related to social things social justice oppressed populations peoples potential i have a big desire to help people and im interested in social causes and on my very top are things like social work sociology and law but im very afraid of the challenging aspects of my personality and how contrary are to the abilities i need to have for these fields i dont want to be an incompetent professional because of my characteristics and disorder im extremely afraid of having to leave college again or not being able to succeed and i know that there are different ways to work in these fields not necesarilly having the most direct contact with people but i want to have direct contact too i had an experience in my previous major where i interviewed a person in treatment process after they finished their sentence and i felt so passionate while doing it and i liked so much interviewing him analyzing their protective and risk factors to later make a treatment plan closest experience to social work i also worry that if i go to therapy and solve these issues maybe i will end up realizing that i cant stand naturally and in a healthy way working for long periods of time with people why is that im not naturally inclined or interested to paths with way less focus on people tt,3
so correct me if im wrong about any of what im about to say i noticed that the treatment for avpd is cbt which would be pretty much the standard treatment for a lot of mental health problems so is it worth going through the process of being diagnosed with avpd when you could just be diagnosed with something like say anxiety and still get the same treatment options again if im wrong dont hesitate to correct me thanks and have a great day,3
i just cant deal with the phone calls im so much isolated that now i feel like i cant talk to anyone im need jobs badly so applied but i just couldnt make it to go for the interview i already know i dont have any skills and nobody will hire me with this type of personality i cant even defend myself in the fight like if someone raise the voice get so emotional and feel like crying,3
like i wont be accepted as their other friends like this person has a lot of other friends too and im totally replaceable so i start to panic and then try to end the friendship quickly like not intending to ruin it i just feel i wont be accepted i feel new i feel like i dont belong anywhere like sometimes i feel i need someone who is just like me with no friends and totally weird in social world idk its just the thought of talking to someone who is more like extroverted to other people making me feel sick like so fucking sick like why and how do you talk to people how did you even find this amount of supportive loving friends who accepted you why that isnt me im just so hurt that i dealt with since i was literally a child i hate myself so much i have been diagnosed with avpd last month and i didnt know what was it i think i have it combined with anxiety and depression and cptsd as well i think im sure of this since my psychiatrist said that idk anymore what to do with my life i want friends who are like me and well like me idk anymore,3
i am slightly shaking as im writing this i hope this post isnt all over the place ampxb i have tried everything to combat my phone addiction from productivity apps to uninstalling social media and reinstalling them again etc i gave up on school despite having been a very bright kid who skipped middle school grades as an immigrant to a new country but now im an extremely miserable and depressed year old girl with absolutely no life and with severe anxiety i keep my mind occupied by scrolling endlessly on my phone my goto coping mechanism used to be daydreaming but now even daydreaming costs too much energy and the content of the dreams are almost involuntary and disturbing so now i dissociate differently through scrolling endlessly and losing track of time as well as my surroundings for hours a day now my heart is beating hard and im feeling extra anxious and panicky all because i turned off my phone i tried to get away from my laptop too but here i am writing this i have pretty noticeable chest pain as a reaction of trying to avoid numbing my brain scrolling on tiktok i feel pathetic currently i am having a really bad time i feel left out and abandoned my only friend and boyfriend whos the most wonderful human being is out with his friends im happy for him but we havent been able to call or play together for a week and even though i am an adult i am not in a place where i can just go hang out with him i kept my relationship with him a secret from my parent who i live with to keep the peace and to not destroy the heart of my exceptionally kind loving and sacrificial mother who happens to be religious my other siblings and i have disappointed her enough especially me her once very happy intelligent bright and ambitious baby she knows i dont have friends or a job or any activities for that matter i almost never leave the house except for going to my therapy sessions so coming up with excuses to see my boyfriend has also been a huge challange he has done his absolute best during our relationship he is the most caring compassionate and nurturing partner of all time he is my best friend a person i can be playful and comfortable with and i try not to make my avpd or other mental health stuff effect him i dont want him to feel guilty having fun with his friends but i am so extremely jealous he can go out and do whatever he wants and he has friends he can do things with even if im his priority due to my circumstances i cant even make it all worth is im currently depressed and have nothing fun to talk about or do i cant even find excuses to leave the house so im not blaming him i am blaming myself for all of it for how i feel for the guilt i feel after realizing how jealous and bitter my feelings are for being so uninteresting and for not doing more to change trying not to use my phone now all of the sudden may also have to do with the fact that i dont want to stare at my notification the entire time waiting for a text from him if he doesnt text i feel lonely and left out if he does text i feel like i will never experience ever going to places and parties with him and i get jealous i dont let him know these feelings while im feeling them i love this person immensely he gets worried about me and i dont want his weekend to be ruined by his clingy gf even though when i have breakdowns of any kind he reassures me that i didnt ruin his day and he prioritizes me over other stuff in his day to just either come and be with me we live in different cities or call me until i feel better i want him to be happy i have seen the positive impact i had on his life and his impact on mine and im scared that my loneliness and clinginess could hurt him or hurt either of us so i try to tone it down as much as i could im tired i miss him so much and i also feel bad for missing him because i find it near impossible to do anything else with my time that he is the only thing left in my life,3
ive lost myself to the point where i feel like theres no meaning to being a part of society throughout history human beings have been motivated by goals and aspirations but i feel like i can no longer endure this way of living the loss of my sense of self has left me feeling adrift and without any direction or purpose,3
i want to give this therapist more of a chance and im tired of looking the one i had previously was too casual and kept directing the conversation towards family drama rather than focusing on me the therapist i have now talks a lot often feeling like a motivational speaker it seems like a lot of her advice boils down to just do it which isnt always a negative but im not looking for simple actions to take which is important but cbt can be extremely disappointing im interested in delving deep into my psyche but she doesnt seem as curious as id prefer she doesnt ask enough questions and seems to assume a lot about me as if my concerns are simply general concerns with general roots behind them she talks specifically about surface problems but vaguely regarding experiences and the reasons for problems in this life i know that we all share a lot of the same feelings and experiences but thats not what im interested in emphasizing and to be honest it doesnt make me feel better i already know other people feel similarly to me i already know that but i also know that everyones experience is different people go to these pages to feel less alone and it does help slightly but thats not enough i dont care to hear that im normal it just feels minimizing i want to connect with people but feel utterly incapable of doing so even when i put myself out there and have conversations i feel like im not really there talking to them and theyre not seeing me my therapist wouldnt even see the avpd she thinks i just have depression i dont know what to do im scared to open up to her about my concerns i dont know how i would do that cbt is helpful in that it gives people practical ways to help themselves and take control of their lives like taking small steps for example but its not enough for me,3
i cant tell if its avoidant personality disorder or body dysmorphia or a sick combination of both but i highly suspect i suffer from avpd it just all makes so much fucking sense too much honestly and it hurts to think that life will always be this painful i feel like theres nothing i can do about it ive always said i feel like an alien that i feel like i experience being a human differently than everyone else is because if everyone else was hurting as much as me no way theyd be able to keep it to themselves everyone would be crying all the time and theyre not so i must be the weird one i have these online friends i wanna meet known them for years and they only live a few hours away theyve expressed interest several times and im just this freak who cant leave the house the thought of them looking at me terrifies me theyve seen me through a phone screen but what if in person im too ugly realistically i know they wouldnt suddenly turn on me and start bullying or anything but the idea that the thought still might pop into their heads something along the lines of oh disappointing or at least i dont look like that its too much its painful to think about theres one friend who is pretty special to me we met as kids through an online game had a little flirtycrushpuppy love thing going on for a while but we grew up and didnt stay as close through the years just checking in here or there but lately they have become one of the most important people ever to me and those dumb childish feelings started coming back only now i think its evolved into something more and i seriously have been hopelessly pining after them for the past years or so recently they said they liked me took me completely by surprise as i had been trying and failing miserably to get over them so this should be great news but nothing can happen now we just expressed our mutual like and now we flirt a little here and there but they said they dont think they can be in a romantic relationship right now yet they keep initiating all of the flirting and they mentioned how its hard not seeing me because if we could hang out things would be easier which makes a lot of fucking sense but this is also all very confusing im stuck im terrified im ugly theyve seen my face and know that im fat but theyve never really seen me not fully not from every angle not up close not in person im anticipating the rejection the disgust and its too much i wanna hold onto this idea in my head of us living happily ever after and changing the relationship will probably end in disaster they said they need my friendship and that theyre scared this could ruin things im scared too im scared theyll see me and any feelings of like will fade completely and if i tell them this im scared it will only speed up the process they talk about wanting to kiss me and things like that and ive never done anything with anyone yr old me is freaking out i always hoped they would be my first back then lmao so many firsts i wanna have and im scared it will mean too much to me and not them how do i express this do i even try how the fuck do i get over this and go see them i need to see them i need them i need i need i need i need help can anyone talk to me,3
i feel pretty bad about it too last weekend i had plans i didnt and the weekend before that i actually was sort of going through something but tonight i just dont want to see anyone so i cancelled again but i am trying to make up for it and i offered to do lunch sunday hes accepted im unsure if i told him about my disorder and honestly i think hed not get avpd anyways i have had many experiences telling people about avpd and they just sort of give a wellmeaning but not getting it nod i have been diagnosed with avpd for well over a year now and ive been in therapy for even longer so im quite good at the whole mindfulness thing so this year has been all about selfimprovement for me and i just dont feel ready to go back out into the nightlife we go to gay bars quite frequently we are both gay i feel like im in my chrysalis as i finally work on myself for the first time like ever going out feels like im forcing myself to hatch too soon and i just imagine myself as this gooey halfbaked butterfly if i try to go out now i want to get to my full form to go out and about and im just not there yet but further going out is a lot of things that could go wrong for me where am i going to put my car ubers are a lot of money here what happens if i leave it at his place but i want to go home earlier than him etc etc being alone in my apartment is just so peaceful but its lonely and i know if i keep this up when the loneliness becomes too much further on down the road i might not have any friends left to see,3
i am completely struggling i am feeling a ton of social anxiety and to compound that avpd is on overdrive desperately want to hide and isolate and just get away from everyone including the few people i actually know here just hopefully stubbly ditched my one acquaintance here to go find a spot alone i feel completely uncomfortable physically and mentally i have to stay here because i have a networking event my boss is going to and im a guest of honor so im required to stay until tonight for but that makes everything even worse because people are bound to come up to me and ask about my work shit i hate avpd everyone here is just chatting and enjoying themselves and learning and i am so in my head i can barely process anything,3
while having dinner mom said that hitler was right about people like me and at the evening she said that again and she meant one of two things either people with disabilities should not get married amp should not have kids because their kids would be sick like their parents or people with disabilities dont deserve to live i was beyond shocked anywayi wish i have enough financial resources so that i can leave,3
one of the biggest issues i have these days is the pain i get whenever i enter a shame spiral several times daily to varying degrees ive gotten used to numbing the emotional pain through different techniques but i find that my arms hands and legs ache whenever this happens id describe the pain as similar to the sensation gaining feeling back after being in the cold too long does anyone else have this problem and if so do you have any tips for dealing with it i wasnt able to find any recent posts asking this but apologize if this is a question that has already been asked,3
ive been researching avpd because i relate to it and i know its caused by trauma in childhood but i didnt find any examples what kind of trauma causes it or can somebody have it without any significant trauma,3
if someone calls i feel even more nauseous im relieved whenever its spam,3
would anyone in their early s like to chat occasionally maybe even be friends i literally talk to no one i figure maybe the social interaction could be beneficial,3
i literally dont see a reason to continue living like this i have no friends im incapable of forming any meaningful relationships i lack the ability to function in society successfully i have no long term goals im a burden and disappointment to my family i live in a perpetual state of guilt and fear the only time im vaguely happy is when im drunk but i know thats not sustainable,3
avpd r probably the chillest,3
id never felt more hated than when i look at myself just plain inferior its dramatic but sad you cant really get through much without falling apart dont judge me but to me it really always gonna be like this because ive lost hope,3
kind of a funny bit of trivia i didnt expect to hear avpd mentioned in a very manlyman action movie like the expendables but at one point randy coutures character mentions he is going to therapy for it lol he says it at the second mark in this clip httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvikmkgbtvfvhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvikmkgbtvfv,3
and before well meaning people jump in to say that i cant know that for sure or that theres someone for everyone please note that it will not make me feel better dont undermine my suffering please people dont fall in love with someone whos a shell of a person unable to function and express themselves they dont become friends with people like me but without human connection you are not able to grow up you are left a forever lonely lost child in a slowly decaying body theres only so much healing a person without a support system can do on their own its excruciating and humiliating constantly feeling like youre worse than everyone around you a cruel parody on a living creature,3
it was really nice even though we mainly talked about tea lol and how rough life is i wanted to hear them out and it had been a while since we had connected one on one like that we ended up chatting for hours just between the two of us and it was really nice i had never done that before with anyone except my family and my boyfriend i think what made it better was how much they understood the hardship of justtalking about problems we both struggle with even talking about ourselves went through some real shit together and finding someone else we could really talk to without fear of anything happening was so relieving they arent on avpd level like i am but they really get it even though its still been really hard trying to socialize irl ive felt really good about my progress to reconnect with online friends lately and have real conversations more with them and my bf and its really helped a lot as ive been living alone and felt really lonely as of late especially with the rough time ive had the past few weeks it was a really nice pickup and it made me realize again how secure i can manage to feel with the right people,3
im certain id be diagnosed with this disorder and many prophets would too john the baptist for example lived in the wilderness until he started his ministry now that is dedication there are many verses related to avpd in the bible ill post some at the bottom i avoid everyone but jesus because he is infinitely loving and wise and talking to other people is torture in comparison ive experienced this phenomenon in my life many times and i see it constantly across every facet of life friend groups businesses etc if a kingdom is divided against itself that kingdom cannot stand mark it seems that we have realized no matter who or what we come into contact with its only a matter of time until it falls apart i would argue this is not a disorder but wisdom in fact i would encourage everyone to lean into this whatever can be shaken let it fall jesus christ is the only solid foundation he is the only thing valuable enough to unite around without christ it will fall apart your new social circle workout plan job hobby dont settle for second best dont put your faith in a priest pastor friend partner family go straight to the source hes waiting for you to call out you will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart jeremiah ask and it will be given to you seek and you will find knock and the door will be opened to you for everyone who asks receives the one who seeks finds and to the one who knocks the door will be opened matthew avpd do not love the world or anything in the world if anyone loves the world love for the father is not in them john you adulterous people dont you know that friendship with the world means enmity against god therefore anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of god james if you belonged to the world it would love you as its own as it is you do not belong to the world but i have chosen you out of the world that is why the world hates you john and before someone brings up eternal hell visit rchristianuniversalism not all christians believe eternal hell is biblical,3
do people get frustrated by you i dont know why but i detect frustration when im around others sometimes i just want to move far away and start a new life i just want to get away from it all and disappear they dont accept me and so i just feel like im better off alone for eternity i want to live on a remote island people just judge me for the way that i am and i hate it i dont know why they hate me so much,3
due to an array of weird circumstances i am a manager a manager with avoidant personality a manager who cant even say hi to her coworkers or ask for help a very necessary skill for a manager a manager who is visibly pushing down a panic attack each moment choking on words and shaky hands and youre too scared to ask to step down bc you already done so times i have no idea whether to tackle the somatic issue my panic attacksnervous system arousal or the core issue which is my feelings of not being worthy i feel like i am inherently toxic and cold i never say hi to anyone even though a manager should be approachable and amicable i will say i focused a bit on healing somaticallythe physical symptoms at least with somatic healing i dont lock down and go onto a full blown panic attack anymore where i am mute and shut down i know my limit i been a manager for a year now i been avoiding my family my career is falling apart and i have lost all my friends i need help but i feel like financially it is not possible i want to be medicated but ssris didnt do jack for me weed just bites you in the long run not sure if meds can ever really heal this i just want to stop having panic attacks but i know my core issuesinner monologue ans my unprocessed childhood trauma are what kick me into panic mode everyday panic mode makes me mute and silent which peoppe percieve negatively i go into work and feel inadequate for anyone ever seeing me at my lowest i avoid them out of fear of ridicule and the cycle continues,3
people have commented before on this and what it is is that i basically look up to people in the way a child would look up to an adult and i do this because i admire how other people my age act like real adults and are confident and capable of doing adulty things i absolutely am not a real adult despite my age i also tend to want these people to look after me a bit make me feel safe protect me from other people because i view them as competent whilst im essentially an over grown child i suppose this could stem from childhood trauma where i didnt feel protected maybe so i now try to hide behind other people to feel safe i dont know if anyone else experiences this ive never seen anyone talk about something like this before so i fear im just a complete weirdo im not sure if this is actually a sign i have dependent personality disorder or something instead of being avpd related hopefully you guys can let me know if this is avpd related or not,3
i know recovery is never an uphill slope but it still feels like shit when you take steps back after getting little to no socialization for the past decade ive been really pushing myself to get out there more ive joined a peer support organization for people with mental illness and ive been going multiple times a week some days i feel like im making progress by challenging myself to engage in conversation and when it goes well it feels nice but thats not every time sometimes like today i feel like i dont belong and shouldnt be there there were so many people today i just felt invisible and like i didnt matter so there was no point to even trying to make conversation maybe it was too overwhelming or i had nothing to add to any coversations and yet i still feel like im back at square one logically i know im not because im still going to keep trying but it just hurts to feel this way to always feel like youre invisible and shouldnt exist i dont want to feel like this i want to have friends so badly its painful to be this lonely i want to belong and yet i still believe i wont im not giving up it just sucks personality disorders suck,3
ive been in therapy on and off since ive been diagnosed with major depressive disorder generalized anxiety disorder and bulimia recently ive been diagnosed with adhd too though recently ive been thinking something more is wrong with me ive been in therapy and been on meds since with med increases and it helps but in stressful times or when i forget to take my meds i go back to the same thought patterns recently theyve been coming up what makes me think its avpd because for the past decade and a half ive always felt inadequate and not good enough no matter what i do its rare for me to think im good at something but even then i feel like im bragging and being obtuse or being narcissistic objectively ive had success ive been to a reputable college and for grad school i went to an ivy league school but i feel like its a fluke i constantly feel like a nuisance and a burden i regret and am critical with most of my reactions with other people and assume everyone is tired of me or thinks im annoying even though no one says anything or gives me one statement like whats up with all the talking i dont like to be the first one to call someone a friend because i want to make sure they feel like they are my friend i dont want to impose myself on them and i assume they dont want to be my friend even some of my friends now i get into episodes where i assume they dont like me but because theyre nice they tolerate me i dont like to reach out to them first because i dont want to bother them i dont follow up with friendships because i dont want to bother anyone theres people that i loved to spend time with and liked them as a human but i dont want to bother them at all so i avoid i dont really date ive had dating apps but i can only use them if i pay for the parts that lets me see who likes me first and then i go from there regarding jobsworking initially i would take the first job offer i got because they wanted me because i would assume im not good enough for any other place i tend to be the person since high school to primarily only speak until im spoken to or is asked to speak otherwise i stay quiet i only have a handful of friends that ive known for at least a decade that i ask to hang out but otherwise i usually dont initiate conversations or social events if i do it with high anxiety and expectation of rejection criticism is also detrimental to me ive gotten better at it in the past year or so but it still just debilitates me i feel like a failure and want to run away when i get criticism so basically because ive been like this since high school currently im thinking i have avpd my job is social and interactive with people which makes it seem like i dont have it but my impostor syndrome is so high unless i get verbal confirmation from others that im doing good with everything else i assume im a bad person and i need to isolate andor disappear with family and friends and coworkers does anyone else relate i have a therapist and im going to bring this up tldr i think i have avpd because of my baseline fear of rejection criticism wanting to have close friends but feeling inadequate andor like a bad person and i dont want to initiate friendships or relationships unless they confirm they want to be my friend andor like me edit i think im looking for anyone who thinks this might be avpd andor validation idk,3
im currently in uni not doing well and today i decided to show up to a lecture a girl from my dorm who takes the same classes as me sat in front of me i saw her subtly taking a pic where i was in the background and circle my face out on it to put the attention on me in snapchat i have been avoiding all dorm activities and i know everyone else have become a tight group of friends while i have been too scared to go out there and get out of my dorm room to interact with anyone for the entire semester when i think about it it makes perfect sense that people find me weird and make fun of me its being the odd one out the asocial guy who doesnt show his face i mean i dont even know the names of the people in my hallway i can understand why they would talk about my strangness or see me as weird even be kind of disgusted by me i am extremely akward i lack social skills i am anxious and get panic attacks emotional flashbacks when around people i have no healthy boundaries and do not know who i am as a person have no consistent sense of self to cope with all this i avoid all situations in which people could reject me or shame me for my insecurities lack of social skills etc by avoiding situations i am trying to avoid getting rejected or ridiculed and deep down i know its only normal to be frowned upon for being different or weird think about the fact that you cant help but look at someone who walks weird because of arthritis or when you come accros a homeless man lying on the side of the street your attention either gets caught or you try to consciously ignore it somehow i was still somewhat believing that i could fool the people in my dorm and hope they wont think of me as flawed insecure weird antisocial a loner etc after seeing that i am indeed most likely a subject of ridicule mockery disgust etc to the people in my dorm i can fully drop my delusion i have cptsd and i developped my avoidance because of childhood emotional neglectabandonment and abuse by my narc mother my brain is wired differently than the average person with healthy and good enough parents i didnt have secure attachments in childhood and i am for that reason developmentally arrested the people in my dorm dont know me and dont know about my trauma or cptsd they are doing what humans do pointing out the weirdness the odd one out the undesirable it triggers people when they are confronted by something they dont understand or find weird its normal they have their own insecurities and issues and can project all of that on the black sheep on the odd one out if i had healthy parents good enough social skills and a fully developped and trauma free brain i would probably do the same when i encountered a weird person heck i even have judged many people for being strange undesirable or weird myself and thought i was superior to them,3
i keep forgetting that some of my vent posts are actually more to do with social anxiety than avpd at least it seems to be that way because people in here dont seem to relate to some of my posts so i guess its more to do with social anxiety than avpd just wondering if u guys think you have both or just avpd im a bit confused about how some people with avpd dont have social anxiety as i thought they went hand in hand but i guess not,3

i always have to somehow hear about whatever the hottest new topic is be it politics tech music media scandals etc and it is excruciatingly stressful to pretend to be interested in it whenever someone asks about it okay im kidding no one asks me anything about anything cuz i dont talk to people but seriously i see it all the time and everyone has to respond to it its exhausting,3
this happened month ago i m was being approached by a woman that was in the same class in school with me some years ago i was just loading groceries into my car when she drove past behind me and said loudly oh hey thats a familiar face i turned around and was pleasantly surprised to see her we started to talk she said she has seen me in this supermarket before we exchanged some small talk what do you do where do you live do you still have contact with the people of the past this kind of stuff i already was kind of nervous because of the small talk situation but when the topic of the other people from the past came up i began to panic the thing is that i was being bullied for the years that i was in this class not from her she was always nice but the time in this class left its marks and i didnt want to have anything to do with the people from these circles after i was done there so at the end of our talk she asked if we should exchange numbers and i froze there were just so many thoughts in my head but i couldnt say any of them because none of these were appropriate for a casual conversation after years a small part of me was flattered that she remembered me and cared to approach me but all the other parts of my brain were actively persuading me why this was not a good idea when i exchange numbers i will have to be prepared for her to calltext anytime i dont like this i clearly still have a problem with the old times and the people from the past when i calltext with her then i will have to explain this sooner or later or just lie and pretend that these things did not affect me this is not the kind of topic that i can casually bring up after years so i cant explain this and dont think that i can lie either besides if i exchange numbers then i will have to well talk text ask questions like a normal person and since i live very isolated i kind of forgot how to do this and what do i do if she wants to get a coffee or meet others its better to just end this here now and not exchange numbers but i cant say that i dont want to exchange numbers who does something like this i would have to explain this i was spiraling im not sure how long i stood there saying nothing i guess she could tell from my face that there was a problem then she said you dont have to say anything i think i mumbled something like okay and it was really nice meeting you and we parted i should have just exchanged the number and go from there i really would have liked to be able to do this but i couldnt i regret this now and i am constantly thinking if i should contact her i know her address but of course not her phone number so i would have to write a letter i guess and try to explain things at least tell her that it really was nice seeing her and that my reaction or lack thereof was not because of her but had other personal reasons but of course everything is much more awkward now than if i would just have exchanged the number,3
its starting to warm up because spring is coming and whilst i love the warmth i also worry about spring and summer because i often feel really lonely at this time of year everyone will be going out and i will be stuck inside on my own,3

i f dont know how to explain myself to the people closest to me when they look at me they see potential and they figure i should be more independent i graduated college in december and my family although they wont say it to my face expected me to land an impressive stable job right out of college but they didnt realize and i know this is mostly my fault because i never really opened up to them about it that my avoidance got progressively worse as i went through college i never made any friends not one always too self conscious and awkward i dont talk to anybody i met in college i was even on the volleyball team and never got close to any of my teammates over the four whole years only kept it amicable and surface level always to scared to open up i grew progressively more lonely as the years went on i felt a lot of shame about my lack of social life and made sure to never really bring it up around family when i would see them over break i figured all that mattered was that i get good grades and work hard in volleyball besides my social anxiety and depression would be so overwhelming most days the only thing i felt like i had the energy for was school and sports i was constantly overwhelmed and didnt have the energy desire or confidence to be social the worst part was hiding this part of myself from family always feeling like im constantly hiding i basically just went through the motions in college but thats honestly all i had the energy for it felt impossible to dream up a future a career because i was just trying to get by each day i would always and still do feel guilty for wasting my time in college for passing up dozens of opportunities that were right in front of me because of my avoidance and fear so its been three months now that ive graduated and i still dont know what im doing with my bachelors degree i know im letting my family down ive been living in my mom and stepdads house since ive been out of college and i only recently got a job at a cafe and everyone seems to think im selling myself short doing the bare minimum the thing is this job was basically handed to me because my mom is one of the managers and they were desperate for people i only just started this job and dealing with the customers has been hell but i thought this would be a good way to finally step out of my comfort zone even if im not using my degree yet at least im earning my own money right wrong it doesnt feel like enough i suppose i feel pressure to live up to other peoples expectations of me but i also honestly know i should be doing more i should have a license a social life an exciting job more independencebut theres something wrong with me something missing i know i should have more compassion for myself but thats really hard in the position i find myself in im honestly more frustrated with myself than anything i feel intense shame about my lack of social skills and general fear of people this simple cafe job even feels like too much for me because of all the interacting with customers which only fills me with more shame and frustration if i cant handle this job then what can i handle i feel stuck and hopeless i think i might be looking into a therapist so theres that sorry for making this so long,3

hello just want to share my experience please watch out with using meds long term especially benzos if you need meds you need meds no doubts but most meds dont heal theyre a temporary solution i compare benzos to alcohol very effective for anxiety strange comparison no they both make things worse in the long term a benzo addiction is one of the worst addictions you can have my psychiatrist putted me on them for years daily in didnt knew better years ago no internet very irresponsible from him the withdrawals are insane i never experienced something like that even more harsh compared to hard drugs wellbenzos are a hard drug and i did a lot of drugs in the past i learned from it years ago i said for every problem theres a pill can you imagine that i was delusional and unaware theres not a magic pill or drug sorry i have to say this maybe im saying well known things but use benzos with caution weeks at max or times a week otherwise youre in for a very unpleasant surprise that can ruin your life but yeah im not a docand dont stop taking your meds cause youre reading this talk about it with a professional ask advice do research about the meds youre taking meds can help a lot but not long term long term a big no go,3
my only purpose of writing this is probably just to vent i dont even know if this is a right sub for me to post on because i dont have any diagnosis but i feel i can relate to most things described here im years old and basically i feel like a defective human specimen im scared of everything every task or opportunity seems impossible to achieve even when im writing this i can almost feel physical pain i cant communicate with people and feel inferior to basically everyone and unworthy of anything the feeling of powerlessness and inability to change this is unbearable i dont know why i decided to write all of this and what to expect but here it is wishing a good day for anyone that might somehow read this post,3
i talk to a lot of people sometimes then i get really exhausted and cant keep up then i dont want to talk to many people anymore the people i end up not talking to anymore some get really upset at me for not talking to me anymore but they dont tell me so how am i supposed to know,3
i quickly notice negative behaviours when i talk to people i feel like their sound changes they roll their eyes etc so i stop talking to them immediately and when i notice it ruins my day it is one of the things that makes me avoid most of the social interactions can you guys relate,3
please someone to encourage me help me its going to get worse if i dont go its been more than a week already i hate that im neglecting and selfisolating myself so badly because of my issues i hate it so much im so lonely the only motivation i have is from myself and needless to say theres literally none incidentally i have to see a doctor a dentist an orthodontist and an endocrinologist and its so so so hard to get myself to do it oh god im like slowly decaying,3
my parents have decided to stop paying for my food in the middle of a catatonic depression im scared for myself i woke up today finally having had enough with starving i was on my way to the store for the first time in a month ive only been running low about a week tho when i got this text from my dad do not spend any money at all this week rent is coming out and there is only enough in there for the payment unfortunately you have gone through the remainder of the borrowed money from the loans i took out and you didnt get a rent discount this year because you filled out the renewal too late you will have to ask for permission before any new expenses for us to move money into the account im backed so far into a corner i am just defeated i have no food left i have no money and i cant bear the judgement it feels like ive already lost everything now theyve even taken my food i cant do anything about it in this mental state they dont even know ive already failed out of my semester and cant leave my apartment and my parents are insane legitimately delusional and abusive human beings i mean im crazy but these folks who starves their mentally ill son because theres not enough money and then flies to vegas for the weekend for a vacation i hate myself but even i dont deserve this the isolation judgement and control i live under is unimaginable theres nothing metaphorical about it it is torture edit im doing alright got some help from a friend for this week looking into my options,3
if people i care about dont make it extremely evident to me that they also actually care about me then i feel unsafe amp i just want to ghost them but i also really cant tell where the line between me needing too much reassurance is vs them genuinely showing me that theyre not that interested i dont really believe that anyone would want to be around me or understand why they would which also clouds my view i feel like having friends is so painful for me because im always feeling like they dont want me around amp not knowing if i should just completely stop talking to them if we havent talked a lot lately or if any aspect of our dynamic shifts its actually easier amp less painful to ignore being lonely than it is to be confronted with constantly feeling inadequate amp unwanted i needed to vent about this but i also want to ask if these feelings have lessened for anyone over time if its just going to be this uncomfortable forever then i actually dont think its worth it,3
hey yall ive just been wondering if any of you have tried and had success overcoming symptoms through meditating could it be worth a shot,3
i get feelings of worthlessness as soon as the infatuation fades even by a fraction its fucking brutal i cant fucking live wondering when is my partner gonna get bored with me and see me as plain as i see myself all the goddamn time i sometimes get this idea of asking normal people how insecure they are in a relationship and measure that and compare it to how insecure i am the difference in results is probably gonna be crazy is it normal with this disorder or im even worse than regular people with avpd this is gonna drive me crazy one day i already feel myself wanting to leave,3
ive been secretly struggling with avpd for years i couldnt even tell you when it began what i do know is it started out as severe social anxiety and has gotten progressively worse as times passed i have panic attackstrouble sleeping nearly every day and feel like im incapable of doing anything of the time ive never told anyone about my struggles today i started online college and signed up for betterhelp therapy through my school im absolutely terrified for this journey but im proud of myself for pushing myself to get here as someone whos struggled to commit to a careerobligations and take initiative with anything this is huge for me i never thought i could get to this point and i still have to follow through with everything ive committed to lol but im wishing you all the best and encourage you to celebrate your little victories everyday,3
how many of these do yall have,3
i just went a week without reading a dm i got after hanging out last week cause i felt they might not want to hand out again the message actually said hey was fun hanging out happy to hear from you again,3
when it comes to dealing with people from family to coworkers i go completely blank and my brain just shuts off like my brain is like oh you have to talk someone count me out afterwards i can draw a million reasons why the way someone behaved mostly negative and i have no objective insight into how the person received the interaction im honestly lost so to not be a burden and not become depressed im just going to isolate its easier safer and more peaceful i have no conviction that im able to socialize,3
i heard avoidants are reluctant to seek therapy well in i had a very hard time struggling with my mental health i have ocd i scheduled therapy times with different therapists and unscheduled it before every appointment because i couldnt gather the courage to go i could not stand the fear of being judged and exposing my vulnerability like that i felt so ashamed i wanted to vanish anyway currently i am on meds for my ocd because i finally managed to go to a psychiatrist however i dont wanna be on meds forever so i started therapy too it has been sessions so far and i am seriously considering leaving although i see how this can be helpful i cannot stand the shame it brings me to talk about myself like that it doesnt matter how many times the therapist says he wont judge me and understands me my brain tells me that is absolutely impossible to make it worse i cried last time on therapy because i was talking about some very personal struggles this made me even more ashamed the therapist lives near my house and as fucked up as that sounds i am so scared to walk near the place where he lives and cross him on the street it happened once yesterday i was there and felt as if i was gonna faint not exaggerating the shame is unbelievable my next session is on friday today is wednesday oh dear god i cant believe i am paying to feel like this i cant even tell if his approach is the problem or if it is just my avoidance honestly i think id feel like this with any therapist,3
i spend my days ruminating about what could have been i basically stopped living when i was years old i am now i wish i can just go back in time to change everything,3
she doesnt deserve to ask for a hug and especially not in the right to pretty much force it on me while she says shes just stressed after yelling in my face because i made a minor mistake then complains about how neither me nor my dad give her affection if she and i can agree the man she married is horrible then she should be able to look in the mirror and recognize what she sees too but no coz shes better than him im only ever patient with her and when she happens to see what i did isnt to perfection im just degraded in the angriest and loudest manner possible and reminded for how i keep making mistakes then theres my dad who is an emotionally and verbally abusive misogynistic narcissist whom i just tolerate because anytime i say something im deemed too young to know anything or too serious even though i silenty seeth with anger everytime they put me down everytime that anger and resentment fades away i still go back to craving the love i want from them and loving them the ways i know i can that they will accept theyre very fortunate to have as good of a daughter as i am and they dont even realize it why do i have to live with this repeated mistreatment for being human,3
by this logic i must be a real piece of shit,3
i dont know if this is the right place to post but there is this guy in my uni he is very enthusiastic with me maybe because i was nice with him when i saw him depressed still says he is he spends so much time alone but i dont know how to return the enthusiasm and i feel so disappointed in myself after each convo with him i have never had any friend growing up so i dont have that much experience when talking to people but he is a really nice person and i dont wanna keep disappointing him sometimes i avoid him just cuz i dont wanna keep giving him more depression out of my dryness,3
hello so i woke up stressed again and thought i should really open up here because maybe others are going through something similar long story short ive had such a hard time with finding and keeping work and part of it is because i have difficulty communicating especially when things done go as planned ive gotten so behind on a project that i feel frozen the days and weeks just keep passing by and i keep avoiding talking to the client about the true status and stress keeps growing im afraid to even check my emails most days i know what i need to do and i know i need to talk to the client so that i can move forward and also so that i can get paid but i really feel frozen with shame and avoidance and stress frozen is the best word to describe it i hate these feelings,3
i think about old friends every single day always reminiscing about the good old days where i used to have people that liked me and i used to laugh a lot and make memories ive never since forgotten i regularly fantasise about still hanging out with old friends i havent spoken to in over a decade making up memories that never happened just trying to forget that are not part of my life anymore the only times ive ever been truly happy was just being one of the guys where i was invited to things and people liked having me around for some reason i couldnt quite understand and i just pushed everyone away assuming they all secretly hated me with absolutely evidence to support that claim then i spend the rest of my life thinking about them every day hoping some day they might still think of me and reach out cause i definitely am not the one to do it first i havent had a friend in years now and my life feels so empty without them they really do fill a massive gap in my life feeling wanted and liked by others is the best thing ive ever felt but it never lasts long before they see how really odd i am and a distance starts forming anyway sorry for the rant just having one of those days that even though its exactly the same as every other day it also just feels worse for some unknown reason,3
i dont understand why such minor situations cause me so much embarrassment and shame i just asked to sign up for something and i was told i cant until tomorrow and now im hating myself and wishing id never leave my house or socialize thats something that would mean nothing to other people and yet it makes me feel nauseous i really hope these symptoms can get better because i dont know how i could live the rest of my life this way im tired of feeling constant shame and embarrassment when im in public and within social situations that leave me feeling suicidal when its never a big deal to anyone else i hate how sensitive i am especially to silly things does anyone else feel this way,3
as a m whose never been in a relationship before i dont see myself really learning or understanding how to datebe a good partner on the level of women who are my age for others in this situation how do you cope ive thrown myself at my career as an addiction counselor guitar poetry working out boxing but a bit of a void is still there what else can i do to stop feeling like im missing out,3
i had social anxiety or still have some of it i also was diagnosed with avpd by one therapist but i am not sure if that one fits i tick a few boxes and every personality style test says i am anxious avoidant but i dont really know what that would mean so what it something that makes someone avpd in your experience,3
i dont live with my her anymore so she has less power but she likes to use my bond with the family dog as a weapon my vulnerable narcisstic brother over yo pretends not to like the dog he doesnt actually hurt the dog but he pretends not to like it and the dog can sense it and feels confused he moves between this and making a joke about it in front of others to cover himself that it is just purely an act for example i know he will have some pictures taken with the dog showing that he likes the dog so if anything were to happen he would play victim yet he will keep them hidden my nmon knows my brother does this out of insecurity towards me and she plays to it when i speak to her on the phone she will bring my brother into the conversation even when i was not talking about him she pretends to mishear that id asked him a question just so he can say something like im just busy punching the dog then my nmom gleefully says back to me he says hes says he is punching the dog and she does this to make sure i say something back so they get the reaction their looking for even though she knows i can hear perfectly well what he said i dont take the bait but says something to move the conversation along like sounds pretty lame they do this routine all the time in different ways and my nbrother has even started a new one where he jokes about getting ready for his fight with me and my nmon plays to this aswell encouraging the imaginary conflict and trying to bait me into saying something back that escalates the situation of course again if anything were too happen i would be blamed regardless of the outcome cause its all just a joke after all making vague threats of violence and beng lowkey mean to the dog my nmon has done this in the past with her ex bf she would vaguely threaten me with him and she would encourage them to step up and argue with me when they didnt really want too that led to a fight one time with her bf confronted my youngest brother and cornered him in the bathroom he came out crying and said he got punched which led me to react and a fight my bro lied he was just scared i ended up getting arrested and blamed for the whole situation the bf holds deep grudge against me because the trauma so i have to avoid certain family gatherings where he is there even though my nmom orchestrates the whole thing just wanted someone to share this with as its quite depressing,3
ive had the perfect childhood all the opportunities great parents a lot of friends that even now years later are my friends my parents supported me in everything my mom is the best then i got meningitis and everything changed i was never the same again started doing drugs to cope with my emotions yes weed is still an addictive drug partying all weekends with my friends xtc was just a normal thing when going to techno parties its the love drug you feel so connected with others on xtc everyone was on xtc got addicted to weed for years luckily i quitted with that years ago my mom was always worried about me now shes years old and still worrying about me its my task now taking care of them but i cant my dad is dementing when visiting them i use kratomlegal i feel normal and happy then me happymy mom happy but its masking not the real me if my mom sees me happy and positive and yes i notice that directlyif my parents are happy and not worrying i feel better i dont want them to worry i just want her to be proud she says it doesnt matter i am who i am and she will always be proud of me but i see the difference i can read and feel emotions from others very good more a curse than a blessing sometimes i cant clean my house cause i feel to bad and really it feels that people care more about that instead of me the first thing they askdid you clean they dont ask how do you feel so if someone wants to visit me now i need to know it a few days before the visit then i clean even if i feel bad my mom cant visit me unexpected she wants to help me i dont want that anymore im not a kid masking my emotions with kratom for seeing people and not worrying them yes im not complaining about my life when i see them im positive and i really feel good than so its not fake but in a way its fake its making things worse not for the outside world they see me when im on kratom and dont understand why im on healthcare sometimes i hear that others are saying im taking advantage of the healthcare system thats very hurtfull to hear i realize i could have normal life just one dose of kratom and i feel normal like i want to be but thats not how it works now if someone wants to visit me i use kratom for having less anxiety and yes kratom is a miracle for anxiety depression a very difficult choice staying at home for weeks or using kratom going to a concert and seeing new people on my yt channel im the most positive person making videos talking social no one has a clue about how i really feel my biggest fear is losing my parents and its coming closer and closer i feel so much guilt towards them i cant even think about that i owe everything to them i want them when they leave this earth i want them to know that im doing good that its not their fault they dont need to worry i will be alright so they can go in peace gonna stop now cause im tearing up have a good evening,3
hello im i the only one but the more i use social media the more i feel alone social media isnt social at all sometimes i delete everything on my phone feeling so much better but then im getting the fomo feeling installing all the apps again cause i dont want to dissapear and worry people but its most of the time the oppositepeople i support suddenly dissapear a difficult thing to handle im replying to extended to dms when someone criticize me i overreact feeling very bad afterwards i dont want to be that way people dissapear with one touch on a button and im thinking the worst a person on ig when i had my mental health support page killed himself a while ago we texted every night for months i cant save or rescue people but that was a difficult thing to deal with like i failed so its better to quit it all social media is poisoning society i cant expect people to care cause i care for them sad but true but its a vicious circle,3
anyone one else kinda smart but because of zero social skills they never made it i have load of education and a degree but during my degree i was an avoidant mess who struggled socially and once i left there and tried to work it was just traumatic im now and never worked in the field my degree is in and never plan to i have just closed the door on that part of my life and im still just surviving lol i hop from one meaningless job to the next usually low paid and then when people start judging me cos they can see im intelligent and are like why the fuck are you here i create distance then bail out of shame,3
for me having apd is like dying in slow motion you just watch all these years go by one after another as you unwillingly stay alone and sabotage your relationship potential with others its like standing stationary on a train station platform and just watching the trains of life pass you by year after year but you are too terrified to ever get into any of the trains anyone else feels the same thats how i can describe it,3
during the pandemic my social skills plummeted as well as my mental health i deleted all social media and effectively made it impossible for anyone to contact me i had a lot of friends many who were friends for years but i ghosted them all of them i was in such a horrible mental state for over a year that when i finally came out of it all that was left was shame its been years now and im extremely lonely but i dont think going back and trying to apologize would mend any of these relationships i know im a horrible person for doing this but its like i cant help myself,3
for basically my whole life i have been scared to get close to anyone getting close to people and trusting them with personal things about me terrifies me but i want to experience it so badly i feel as if i come across basically like a cold bitch to most people because i struggle to give out compliments or say i love you to anyone especially family it just feels embarrassing in a way another thing is that i hate it when someone likes me too much because i know that i cant give them back what they expect from me and it makes me feel so guilty i had a very average childhood with my parents divorce when i was being the only significant thing i can think of my dad and his new wife bring up to me all the time that im distant and cold and that i need to make more of an effort and im trying my best to but even just simple things like calling his wife by her name takes so much energy out of me to the point of wanting to breakdown as its so overwhelming i just like dont trust myself or my judgement at all and can never tell what level a relationship i have with someone is at and idk where any of this came from as i dont remember being any different is this avpd or something else,3
do you feel that youll be alienated even here among people that have same feelings i bet they hate it so i wont post anything i cant figure out how to make a good comment so if i do theyll think im stupid should i show same reaction to fit it im not diagnosed so i think my experience isnt worth of sharing hiding your true self even here same society same rules same reaction,3
i have terrible avpd social anxiety and hyperhidrosis combination i cant even talk on phonesno friends no job at and dont have guts to apply for jobs even if i do i will not go for interview and i have no skills even if im graduate how to regain the self worth and confidence pls help i cant evn afford therapy,3
my life is spent largely devoted to work between morning prep commute actual work hours and evening prep like laundry packing lunches and other small maintenance tasks i only get about hours a day to be myself after all i need to be in bed at a decent hour or else i wont be wellrested for the next work day thats it thats my life meanwhile even though im so devoted to work that i sacrifice the vast majority of my life for it im barely earning enough money to survive i have over in debt that is slowly growing as i struggle to make ends meet i dont know if i can ever pay it off i can pay off maybe rd of it if i really push hard and eat ramen for the next months im turning in months at what point am i supposed to go from surviving to thriving i know most people earn the majority of their money later in life but i just dont see the light at the end of the tunnel what is my purpose why am i grinding on the worlds worstever rpg system i feel like im on an economic treadmill that keeps speeding up every year and at some point i know i wont be able to keep up my job itself is relatively easy im a data analyst at a medical device manufacturer for the most part its just pulling reports for managers and being really good at excel and power bi though i dont know if im that good at my job tomorrow marks year in this position and every night i feel like im doing the bare minimum like im that guy on the team that everyone else talks about behind his back i imagine they say things like hes so slow whats he even doing all day or i better schedule this meeting because if i wait for him to do it itll never get done they dont say these things out loud of course and maybe they dont even think them but maybe they do maybe im just treading water but refusing to swim towards the shore i think im ok because my head is still above water but realistically if i keep doing this i will drown i need to swim i just feel like such a loser all the time i dont have kids and i dont want them im not married but ive been in a relationship with someone for just over years we live together she makes a lot more than i do so she pays the mortgage and i pay everything else its probably not a fair arrangement for her but i just literally dont make enough to split everything she earns k more than i do a year she would literally need to pay our mortgage x a month just to get to my wage then we could split the th one that would make it even even with that justification in my mind it makes me feel like a loser not that she makes more than me good for her she deserves it just that i cant contribute equally i feel like a mooch we work the same hours at the same company and do roughly the same amount of work but hers pays more thems the breaks i guess overwhelming shame about nearly everything im too fat im too bald im too old im not smart enough im not rich enough im not funny enough i know those are called automatic negative thoughts or ants and like ants they should be easy to squash ive read about them in cognitive behavioral therapy books i would go to therapy but its expensive my company pays for sessions a year the other weeks you can fuck off and die i guess is there more to this life is this all im supposed to do click buttons all fucking day sit on the couch and scroll on my phone while watching some insipid movie or tv show then repeat all day every day until im old enough to scrape by on social security this is it huh this is the whole fucking thing there needs to be more because i swear sometimes it just doesnt feel worth it im not suicidal or anything but like what exactly is motivating me to keep going i have hobbies and interests and i indulge in them as often as i can i grow hot peppers and make my own hot sauces i hike in the woods and enjoy nature theres so many things to occupy my free timeif i had any but the fact is i devote of my day to making someone else richer so my measly hours a day which are in the darkness by the way because the sun has set are not exactly prime times for gardening or hiking i have an automatic timer that waters my plants for me because i cant even be present to tend to my own garden its absolutely ridiculous when exactly am i supposed to do anything of substance of value hours in the fucking dark thats what i get to live off of most of that time is spent focusing on my increasing mound of debt would literally change my life and put me back in the green for the first time in years meanwhile i get to help analyze the company private jet spend cost us over to operate for a total of days last month we paid just in pilot fees for the month of january i dont earn that in a year so when i see how much money there is how much is available to toss around and just how little of it i get why would i work harder why would i sign up for more of this disrespect i just dont know why why cant i work days instead of why cant i be remote considering i have only had facetoface meeting in the last month im wasting a ton of money on a car that i primarily use to get to work a ton of money on a special wardrobe that i only wear at workits absurd and depressing,3
when im alone or doing my own thing i dont feel alone so much im used to being alone and doing my own thing and here and there i communicate with people thats okay but when im suppised to be part of a group i start to feel inferior to others and that i dont belong everyone else is interacting with each other but somehow i am left outside the group the school and uni were propably the worst because you are alone amongst everybody else everyday in my current work everything is okay because i work from home and i dont see the others interacting all the time i just pretend that everyone else is doing their work alone same as me but now we have this group work at my work and now i feel alone again we should be interacting with each other but im not interacting with anyone in meetings i hear how everyone else has been working with each other except for me group work makes me feel so alone,3
i think we all know that feeling when you reveal something about yourself and people are so surprised that youre also human it makes me sad because it reminds me that people see me as this unapproachable amp uncool person when i have my own personality it makes me feel disingenuous and makes me even more self conscious about how i come off,3
and it feels totally warranted its like im sensitive to when people are trying to take advantage of me im aware we live i a society thats all about money whenever i see an ad or celebrity i dont feel the positive emotions other people do so much im more focused on the awareness of what they are trying to do i know in the real world i have few allies if any i do know good people exist but i am disconnected from them by my experience is too unrelatable and they are hard to find,3
my birthday was last month i turned i went to a buffet with my mom because she was the only one who remembered it was nice but the whole time i also had this cold dread in my stomach because this is my life that this is going to be my life forever and a month out the dread is still here its hard to breathe sometimes when i think about how im closer to now than to over a quarter of the way through my life by any metric and i have nothing at all to show for it i still havent met basic milestones others do in their teens and i dont see myself meeting them anytime soon i never learned how to drive ive never lived on my own ive never held a job for longer than a year ive never had a friend let alone a romantic attachment most of my hometown is a mystery to me because ive never gone anywhere or experienced anything and at this point the idea of trying to fix whats wrong is scarier than just rotting away on my own sorry for the melodrama point being im not in a great place right now and its just getting worse over time and i cant talk to anyone about it because i dont know anyone except my mom and she really doesnt understand why i cant just force it to be fair i dont understand either thanks for reading and have a good day,3
it happened lots of times in my life i liked some girl and she maybe liked me too but my thought process was it doesnt matter that i like her its just me and i dont matter she is better off without me i will just ignore her or if something bad happens to me and i am like oh it doesnt matter its just me so its acceptable its like i feel like my life doesnt matter and bad things happening to me and unhappiness is normal in grand schema things maybe its true but i personally shouldnt feel like this right my life should mean everything to me it literally is the only thing i will be ever living,3
idk i used to have an ok outlook on life i now just see things such as as unreachable out of reach,3

i was wondering how many people think the disorder formed because of trauma in their childhood for me the main reason i have avpd is because of emotional neglect and trauma from bullying i think symptoms started showing up during the bullying my self hate really took off from there its kind of a mess though since i was dealing with depression and anxiety at that age but i can see it all makes sense why i have these symptoms after just a few years of it i completely isolated myself and spent years in solitude i dont think i would have avpd without all the trauma as a child from what i see on certain posts is that some people dont seem have that factor in the formation of their avpd whats your experience view pollhttpswwwredditcompolldwi,3

does anyone else get annoyed when either family or strangers get an attitude with you if you dont entertain their conversation i can be civil and nice irl im not walking around telling people eff you eff this eff that however the worst ones are the people that think they are giving me golden advice like hey dont do drugs but they have never known me to do such things its painting me in a bad light for me to agree with the advice willy nilly but the kicker is they get upset if i escalate and say i dont do drugs to begin with do i look like a crack head to them they take it as me being immature and unable to take advice so i am supposed to sit here and entertain disrespectful conversation with people giving me advice on not to be irresponsible and thats what makes someone mature this has happened with strangers too where they think they can talk to me about avoiding marriage cause theirs suck or dating because of their own griefs whether i get married or whatever i do is not their business i usually only get approached with stupid conversations like that by family they get big mad when i shut it down the only carrot they dangle over my head is money i straight up rather be homeless than listen to me being accused of driving recklessly or my mom threatening about my insurance rates going up new flash its my brothers car that has a smashed door because he crashed my car is fine n dandy,3
i was clearing out my apartment today and found this in high school i sent it in to be posted anonymously in a yearly book of poetry that my school made to my horror i found out later that it wasnt anonymous i had no idea what avpd was then but it is shockingly relatable to look back on now hard to post but it feels important that i do i want to be understood but cannot be vulnerable the one who shows their hand first loses carve into me and leave your mark the first one to strike feels betrayed most the retaliation is serrated but i just wanted to know you without borders without pain i just wanted to know you you like me if you can assort me label me and pin me down aggressive bitch salty witch innocent dreamer batshit idealist you color me all kinds of elegant but when it comes down to it im only an impressionist i keep trying to break free of what comes naturally to me find myself in the labels you offer me but the mirror image is fake and so am i i want to feel myself without your hand in my definition,3
im so tired my lifes going down the drain im so tired what will it be like to die,3
hello everyone i am writing this because ive been reading posts on this sub for the past week since ive learned about avpd from my new therapist and researching about this disorder as i believe i also suffer from it and have a curiosity from you people unfortunately not to make anyone feel bad about it as i know this condition is very hard to live with but i have been trying to look for some success stories from people here or maybe just some nuggets of hope from people that have managed to peacefully live this life so my question for you especially maybe for the older people here with the conditionor the ones that have managed to get married or with any other kind of success no matter how small what is your outlook on life what advice do you have regarding managing this condition although ive also had a rough couple of days id like to believe that not all is bleak and that getting access to good stories from people similar to you can certainly help please share anything youd like that might help me and others on this sub,3
at least twice a week on average even for a brief period i am flattened by a crushing wave of fear and dread and anxiety to the point where i taste blood in my mouth its a sickening feeling like you know something awful is going to happen even though you also know its not really life or death but then sometimes that weight is lifted instantaneously through a conversation or email or text my question is what is your physiological and psychological response to that weight being lifted the anxiety leaves your body suddenly and then sometimes i binge eat the opposite of stress eating its not to celebrate but to cope sometimes i have a giddy hyper energ sometimes like now its just a solemn reflection wanted to know how you all coped with the release of torment,3
if so i would love to meet up and talk about our sorrows together im generally very scared of people but i think meeting up with another person who suffers from the same issues would be a comforting experience,3
my guess is i dont think i have a chance so itd be better if they didnt know i liked them so im going to act so dismissive towards them that they could not possibly have any clue how i really felt anyone else relate any advice,3
did anyone else have a lot of rescue fantasies when they were young and even today especially in regards to romantic relationships i started having these rescue fantasies in high school and theyve been coming back into my life recently very hard i was obsessed with the anime revolutionary girl utena as a teenager and into today in my late s i saw myself so much in anthy and i wanted someone like utena to come into my life and rescue me fight for me and love me ive never been in a relationship but this is all i can fantasize about now is someone rescuing me and loving me i recently found a music video like that that i sob every time i watch it but watch it multiple times a day because i want someone to rescue me like that so bad httpswwwbilibilitvenvideo,3
is gaslightning if someone is trying to make you believe that you are unworthy stupid idiot imbecile and that you will never achieve anything in life or is this just some other manipulation i was getting this from my sister my whole life she was older than me and even though when she as saying these things to me i always tried to fight back and say something similar to her it didnt really work she was older and more mature than me so hearing it from her kind of made me believe that i really unworthy human who dont deserve or achieve anything in life she was calling me names since i was a small child i dont even remember times when she wasnt calling me this i dont think that anyone would be able to gaslight me easily but hearing it from older sister who i loved was painful for me i dont even know if i believed these things it just made me feel bad that my sister hates me for no reason or for idk what reason and that made me think that if my own sister hates me than every hates me probably which leads to low selfesteem i guess she had control over me when we still lived under the same roof anything she said i did for her like some servant only years after leaving i realized what was she doing to me wasnt right is this gaslightning or is it something else,3
i know some people are happy to cut ties with people but others feel guilty or anxious about cutting ties and freeze because too much time has passed if someone reached out to me and said something along the lines of struggling with personal things that would be so helpful even if much time has passed the people who you have ghosted are probably hurt and confused and the truth is they probably internalized it as something they have said or done wrong if they did not do anything wrong that is something to highlight hi i just wanted you to know that i have been struggling with some personal things and thats why i havent reached out i am still struggling and not ready to maintain friendships just yet but i do want to let you know i care im sorry if i have left you hurt and confused it was not something you have done wrong i am not in a place to explain further but i do hope you are well some people may be understanding and some people may still be reeling from the hurt and not respond at all or they may decide that they do not want to open the door back up to having contact with you now or in the future because they felt that they were rejected and dont want to risk that again rejection hurts people without mental illness too that is not necessarily a rejection of you but more of a reflection of the place where theyre at mentally it may have taken them a while to move on from the relationshipfriendship some people may feel that keeping that door closed is protecting them from getting hurt again in my opinion that is more than a fair response so before you do reach out if you decide to you have to mentally prepare for whatever decision someone will make one way to look at it is you get the chance to prepare for their response when they never got a chance to prepare for being ghosted unless you let them know you ghost at times,3

does anyone else struggle with figuring out whether theyre a good or bad person im not sure if others have that moral at the top of their list but thats how ive been since i was a kid the most important thing to me was being good ive strived to be a good person for most of my life and i know that humans will be humans and its not all black or white you can be a good person and still do bad things but i just cant help but feel like no matter how hard i try to be a good person im still treated like im a bad person so that is what i must be if i am a good person then why am i treated like im not and why are the bad people treated like theyre good why are the people who turned me into this miserable soul living a happy life while ive been in hell reliving the torment every year since i was a child i dont believe in religion but i was raised catholic so part of me still thinks that life should be that way good people are happy and go to heaven and bad people are miserable and go to hell i know theres no hell and yet i still fear there is i think i might be living it,3

theres not much to be thankful for regarding avpd but if im going to have avpd im at least glad i have it in the modern day imagine how hard it wouldve been in the past nobody would understand you wouldnt be able to get a proper diagnosis or explanation for your mental health issues and youd be totally isolated seeing as there would be no technology and none of the escapism it provides id be bored as fuck if i didnt have video games and drugs i ordered online to cope with this shit you probably wouldve been ostracised from your community and branded a freak maybe even lobotomised or some shit if ur really unlucky im so thankful i have tech and modern day understanding i would be so fucked without it,3
i have bpd and two and a half years ago i met a guy on a trip we only hung out fro three days but our conversations were so interesting we spoke about politics education etc he told people he liked me i was so excited that he liked me usually i dont take big leaps like this but since we live in different countries i went up and asked him if he liked me he told me he had a girlfriend and he cut off all contact with me they broke up two months later and im sure hes been stalking my social media since then but he hasnt reached out to me i know its been a long time but i miss him so much i miss him and i cry about him everyday i need him i just feel like im stuck in this pit of despair and ive tried to change ive dated other guys theres another guy that i like way more and i know he likes me too but theres still a part of me that misses the vacation guy i dont know why i feel so stuck,3
this is an incomplete list of course but ive taken ages to build up the motivation to post something here this is what i got for now im hoping anyone reading this would please add to the conversation their own similar experiences or attributes or would please ask me to expand on any point i have listed i need to consume multiple forms of media on multiple devices in order to be content i divide my attention towards trivial topics i have detailed dialogue in my head that i desperately wish i could record but whenever i try its not detailed i get tired of it and it ends up unfinished i have countless unfinished drafts and scattered files that i take endless time to organize only to still not post what i initially wanted to i take hours to get myself ready to go out typically to my local dive bar i know ill enjoy myself when i get there and i know a lot of familiar friends and faces there but once its time to leave i psych myself out over going my primary concern is that i dont look as nice as i usually do or ill get a detached disassociated feeling once i get there many nights i end up going to bed with my outfit and makeup freshly done and still on never have left my place the red notification circle showing me the amount of unread text and unanswered calls i have is so large that it breaks me out to open the damn thing at all i end up ghosting relationships that i didnt want to abandon the guilt of how long its been when they last sent a message to present day keeps me from responding if i have to make plans with someone i have to actively not look at the other unread messages below it or else ill have an internal panic im selfisolated and alone and lonely more than i ever have to be and i fucking know this i highly value people and relationships despite how my avoiding nature implies otherwise my childhood consists of consistent moving for rarely to none disclosed reasons my mom is an aggressive woman whos genuinely diagnosed with bipolar disorder and its difficult to communicate with her growing up i never lived in a location even close to years i think this has fucked me up in many ways i am a very vivid and active dreamer i speak frequently in my sleep sometimes i wake myself up for my own talking years i had chronic nightmares and was a bedwetter the nightmares and accidents were most frequent after every move this subsided by age when i was done with university and moving as frequently ive used meth for nearly years via smoking and snorting never injections its never made me feel horny like it does most people i compare the sensation to taking dirty adderall meaning i have a zombified obsessive focus on whatever task im either indulging in rabbit holes or addictively playing chess on my phone more broad and accurate to say is that i productively procrastinate my place will get so clean or i fulfill minuscule todo task but i continue to avoid my most pressing and urgent needs actual adderall feels like medicine to me like the focus increase isnt jarring but natural theres no crash and no tweaked out feeling i feel like what i believe im supposed to feel like as a content and motivated individual,3

social situations are nerve wracking because they are unpredictable and i have to come up with responses on the spot there is also the pressure of the other party potentially manipulating you such as in business situations or when someone is trying to sell something to you so before these situations i often try to play out all the different paths that the interaction could take place and try to prepare everything for it this makes each social interaction extremely high effort for little reward in comparison there are also worst possible outcomes in which there is no way to prepare for and where there is nothing you can do about it for example suppose i was buying something from a shop i hand over my money and then the shop keeper just ignores me what can i actually do in that situation call the cops get a lawyer what proof do i have that the money was mine and i handed it over what obliges the shop keeper to give me the item i wanted normal people never question these dynamics and just put trust in the systems set in place theyve never been burned by it so it just works for them but here i am worrying over every little thing that id rather hide away from it all if possible,3

ive isolated myself for a long time i never fit in anyway i couldnt make connections last i always messed up but i tried i now realise that its too late i grew in such an abusive family that i never learned how to love and relate and then i fell ill since then i became disabled sometimes my arms hurt so bad that i cant type ive been trying to survive a gruesome situation for months now i can only communicate in short bursts all the rest that i need is gone and i put myself out there ashamed and small guess what no one cares im at fault too but its not only me i hope it will be over soon but i rather struggle alone i hope that i can get some of my hobbies back take up space i cant chat anymore it makes me want to barf i cant really go outside and to be honest i am scared i found out how easy it is to abuse me its not like i can run just hide theres nothing much to say i truly am alone i am different but i just want to be in peace with myself with the chronic pain with the fact that people and i dont work together im not charming or young im just venting into the nothingness i isolated more and more when i got negative feedback its too late now everybody struggles i dont understand basic things i just want the current crisis to be over dont want to improve myself or to function i want to breathe and sleep without fear until shit really hits the fan and well all break together and apart sometimes it feels like too much to ask i want to believe that i matter not because of someone else its not going to happen,3
tldr i tell myself to kms after making insubstantial mistakes i could really use some reassurance i made a tik tok post about a band i like and i mixed up the names of the members misspelled the renowned venue they played at and accidentally said one of the members passed away two ppl in the comments pointed it out and now i feel like ripping my skin off instantly i started saying to myself you should honestly just kill your self whats wrong with you thats so embarrassing kill your self over and over sometimes i picture myself being impaled or shooting my self in the head this happens all the time and its one of the most debilitating parts of this disorder though im not diagnosed any time i remember something slightly embarrassing i did even years ago i have a totally disproportionate reaction to the embarrassing thing does this happen to anyone else i feel like im doing much better than i was a couple months ago but this persists i hope this isnt too upsetting to share for anyone,3
so i am officially diagnosed with it but most people on the internet and also my therapist say that it is likely because of a childhood of abusivenarcissistic or in any other way bad parents that resulted in this condition but i dont think that it comes from that i couldnt have had better parents or family they supported me respected my opinion and so on i have the feeling that i always was like that even in kindergarten back then the only thing odd about my parents was that they divorced as i was years old but i guess thats not the most uncommon thing and that my father is also very socially avoidant could it also be the latter like in a learned behavior or do you think it is more likely that it was something in the past that i just forgot and dont remember dont think is significant enough often i ironically feel a bit isolated when i see comments on youtube or reddit talking about the reason for the avpd because i cant relate at all to their stories thankfully tho but you know what i mean,3
edit i didnt go edit i sent them a message to pretend i was going but they let me on seen evidently it was a pity invite and im glad not to have gone why even write this by the time i get any replies it will be too late anyways the appointment is three hours from now if i get another job im going to need references a network of aqcuantainces this time i cant rely on my family posing as acquaintances i didnt build a network i never do now i want to run out of there i didnt make any friends i dont want friends anymore i havent had friends since elementary not only do they not respect me they also pity me i was invited out of pity i know because they are surprised i said yes this is the entire setup for the climax in notes from underground i read it i know perfectly how it ends up no one knows my life better than i do and i have been gaslighted too many times into believing it was all in my head if i dont go they also will remember and i have to make a presentation for them a month for now my performance will be scored by them just today we found out neighbors began to speak ill of me and my family one day posthumanism will get rid of all of this bullshit they taking our jobs will be a cheap price to pay for now approach with caution,3
ive had to mentally prepare for this trip for weeks ive been so anxious about going and being around a bunch of girls i dont know well although i was nervous the trip has been going well until last night i was in the bathroom with a couple girls at this bar talking to a girl and just making conversation at one point she just told me to go away i repeated what i said because i thought i had misheard her then she told me to go away again me being dpdavpd i dont handle confrontation well so i just walked away i told another girl there who i trusted and she helped me feel better but these situations are why i struggle with going outmeeting new people at any moment they can just say one thing that completely ruins my whole night and the next day and the next few days after that i know shes probably just insecure and projecting that on to me but sometimes i feel like a magnet for those things im the one who ends up getting picked on and i dont stand up for myself so it keeps on happening,3

sometimes i find myself going through peoples facebook profiles usually it starts with someone im friends with then one of their friends then someone tagged in one of their photos and before you know it im looking at this totally random persons life and im seeing all the good times theyve had the relationships the weddings the vacations and it makes me wonder if i could have been their friend or if i could have been doing those things with them sometimes ill think back to what i was doing at the time the post was made or the photo was taken and find myself comparing my empty life to theirs it makes me feel like shit and yet i cant stop doing it does anyone else do this i dont think its really the traditional fomo that people often feel when engaging in social media posts because im not sad about other people doing something without me right now so much as a broader envy of their life in general its not envy of someone posting pics of their nice car or fancy hotel room on instagram its not the heavily curated photoshopped influencer stuff its envy of people who went backpacking with friends one summer in college its envy of people watching the super bowl together its envy of people falling asleep on the couch with their partner while their kids are going wild playing with their new toys on christmas morning things money cant buy things i never had things i dont have things i never will have,3
i feel like many of us that have avpd dont post speak up or video ourselves this is why we dont typically find much information regarding this i have found more on reddit than on youtube it doesnt mean its not there but there too few and far in between,3

my dad used to play the song december oh what a night in the car all the time and wed sing along to it its very peppy and oldtimey about this guy having a wonderful night on his date with a woman i remember even as a small child id have thoughts like oh what a night that ill never get to have because i considered myself a freak of nature even then,3
im interested in cbt but am too brokeanxious to see an actual therapist,3
im not sure if this is exactly a surprise when having avpd but i found that i often judge people in my mind about the smallest things and those are all the things im hyperaware of and dont let me express freely as a person not only people but also places scenarios comments my mind is stopping me of being able to enjoy simple things in life and i dont want it anymore college is starting soon and im more mature and i want to fit in i dont think ill be able to enjoy any potential friendships i can make if i dont change how i think,3
ive been in my apartment now for two months only leaving for food i know this isnt long but im the unicorn extrovert with avpd among us im supposed to be graduating this semester yet ive gone to none of my classes or done any of the work i have no motivation and i feel that i legitimately dont deserve my degree im withering away and dont know where to start fixing this mess it bothers me that im failing out but not nearly as much as the fear of how my abusive family will react to having to bail me out of trouble again never mind how it feels to still be so controlled as an adult ive already had to withdraw one semester for mental health purposes and i cannot bear having to admit that im in an impossible situation once again and they dont even believe im mentally ill i dont need their approval i just need to not be verbally ripped apart it would take too long to describe how cruel my family can be but it is enough that i am living in a full breakdown trying to keep this lie holding together my dad once called me a year old loser and i keep proving them right and yet id willingly take abuse over the solitary confinement i live in now i cannot do this any longer or im going to snap in half under the weight,3
hey all i have been going through a lot these past few years like everyone else i realized i have high functioning autism i mended my fractured family i found family at work i found god i found peace within myself maybe i never had avpd but i still identify with it i do so strongly that i feel it necessary to post here because i relate to every one of your guys posts and i came up with a year plan to achieve my dream of rvandwellers i have a lot of stuff i want to say i have big big things in the works for my life my goals are endless you can find me on instagram nowatlast if you want to know about me my entire life is there i hope thats okay to add ill delete this part if not anyway i just want to spend my life spreading joy and love and light hippies had the right idea the only reason were here is to be kind to each other there is no other reason everyone have a great night or day its a hard life out here,3
of course personality has its meaning in avpd but when i said personality the second time i mean a person as in the things they like to do or what they talk about ive always been avoidant and i think its rooted in multiple harsh rejections between age and ive come out with interests to talk about besides drawing and drawings to show because i dont want to show anyone i dont show anyone anything and i dont tell them anything unless that conversation territory was already stepped into have any others experienced that where theyre uncomfortable telling people about their interests that they end up with none at all or secret interests for me i have a secret interest but i still cant get myself to talk about it with other people interested in it its like we start talking and i have no idea what to tell them my brain is so messed up that it just blocks out every subject that is slightly attached to my inner self leaving stuff like weather other people whatever they already said ofc those conversations degrade quicklyi end up having no further input fast,3
i dont know what it was about the pandemic that hit me but it hit me hard and i still find myself stuck in so many ways i was never so scared in my life i became agoraphobic and couldnt leave my house i became obsessed with the news and the statistics for someone who has been suicidal practically my whole life i was truly afraid of dying did anyone else find yourself getting worse through this and what did you do to get past it when i go to doctors appts they still make us wear masks and that scares me a bit still like what do they know that we dont im sure im overthinking things like i do with everything else my daughter is anti vaxx and it worries me too ive had them all as a precaution since my health isnt the best now i was working in retail at the time and watched the panic from everyone in the storesand now im on disability because ive gotten so bad about it its crazy,3
i went to a lot of therapists and didnt feel any better do you think that dr richards audio series work for avpd therapists told me that medications are not useful in treating avoidant personality disorder is that true,3
shes stuck with me not of her own will its true she has a strong bond with me but what if all of that is just forced she loves meeting other humans cats dogs and even rabbits i cant help her with any of that i sometimes feel bad for my kitty like she deserves someone less avoidant on the other hand i spend of my social energy on her so shes never starved for attention and she has her own time staring out the window which i resent but understand that she needs i never impose on her when shes doing her cat things,3
does anyone here write stories with characters is it tough in my experience i feel like i dont know enough about people to write characters who arent just like me how is it for anyone else who writes or tries to,3
simply being around people makes me feel so guilty like i am inconveniencing them with my presence and i constantly feel like i need to leave to relieve them of the burden of having to interact with me after an interaction with anyone i feel a deep sense of shame and cant stop repeating sorry sorry sorry in my head i think this one of the things i hate most about this disorder,3
im making progress but all of this seems like a job in which i have to try to fit in i dont know its like im not human and i have to mimic others too much isolation bring to this i guess,3
i spent a long period unemployed and was able to occupy my brain with tik tok and youtube videos they are good in small doses or when practicing moderation to any degree but i literally feel like i have to have a video playing in my ear at all times i listen to podcasts to go to sleep and listen to youtube videos constantly i feel the need to have a video going even walking from my room to the bathroom just completely incapable of allowing myself to think at all this is impacting my ability to work now that i do have a job anybody else experience this have you been able to combat this behavior genuinely so desperate any advice is appreciated,3
everything kinda just hurts and am sad for some reason but im literally not sure or why but literally no one cares but not really sad,3
i dont mean to offend anyone beliefs just a thought came to my mind and i want to discuss it with you recently i redownloaded dating apps and started chatting seeking friends and relationshipsi was chatting with this girl and we talked about many things one of them was relationships she told me that she prefers to be in a relationship with traditional gender rulesthis made me think and realized that a relationship with traditional gender rules isnt for me and i think this mainly has something to do with being avoidant these are my reasons i dont initiate or take actions usually i respond to actions even sometimes i dont respond to actions that other people would respond to i rarely take actions or be proactive i lack assertiveness i also have problem with decision making that is what comes to my mind when i think about it guys with avoidant do you think that you can be in a relationship with traditional gender rules also do you have any other reasons beside the ones i listed if why not,3

trigger warning for suicidal ideation mention also long post alert this is something thats been brewing for a while that i hadnt been able to articulate until now im years old ive been actively trying to combat social anxiety since i was and after reflecting on these past years i truly feel like all of the things i did to try to improve have only made my feelings worse and solidified my fears for example public speaking i was told throughout school and therapy that practicing public speaking would make it easier over time i was also told i would need to do a lot of it to have a successful career so i did the following joined the media club in high school where i made intercom announcements and once made a tv announcement taught spanish to children as an assignment took opportunities to read aloud in class and chose speaking assignments when given the choice in college i had several mandatory presentations i joined clubs and did almost weekly public speaking for various purposes for them i called numbers for a bingo game for over people and also proctored a club election i then became a resident advisor which involved pretty regular public speaking let me tell you it did not get easier yall lmao i swear to god i kept telling myself it would get better and waiting for it to get easier and it only got harder emotionally i definitely improved my skills but every public speaking incident wreaked absolute havoc on my psyche like throwing up beforehand staying up and ruminating after shaking emotional anguish insomnia the works like id argue it got even worse as time went on no amount of praise was ever able to shake it and ive received some pretty consistent positive feedback i have this thought of like probability like i will fuck up and embarrass myself during an event and every time a speech goes well i feel like my odds of failure increase plus im not sure how much i trust the positive feedback ive gotten i can accept that im an effective speaker but anything more than that feels fake like people are lying to make me feel better so public speaking hasnt gotten easier im out of options and its frustrating that no one around me understands this because to them im a sufficient speaker but the idea of speaking to a group of people makes me want to fucking kill myself like every time and now i have a ton of lovely memories that play in my head when i think of speaking like my brain has the motherload of material to make me feel deep levels of shame embarrassment regret anxiety etc i wish id never started doing this stuff because now people actually expect it of me and i am haunted by awful memories that make me feel worse than i did before i mean for fucks sake ill get in a panic because i remembered speaking to kids six year olds who the fuck is embarrassed to speak to six year olds remembering things like this can straightup ruin an otherwise perfect day and completely sour my mood its not just public speaking its making friends joining clubs volunteering working the works i faced my fears and they fought back viciously and after covid isolation i find it literally impossible to force myself to try these things again even though i know im capable of them i just dont want to contribute to the material my brain uses against me i feel full like im out of storage space im just sick of the regret and embarrassment and guilt over existing the way i did i feel like im destined to spend my future disappointing people and failing ill never be like i once was and even if i do then it will just be exhausting and miserable right before covid i was reaching a breaking point anywaylike i was about to quit my job or get fired and possibly school because i couldnt handle the hole id dug myself into i feel spent and directionless i dont know what my goals are anymore i dont even know who i am because i spent so long trying to be someone im not,3
like when they hang out go to a bar or a cafe or just hang out at home or something just such a foreign concept to me lol,3
gtmy therapist taught me how to talk to people and also told me what other people usually thought compared to what i believed they were thinking i viewed people just as evil as my inner self hate talk and they arent that judgmental they care more about how they come off than how you are gt gtwe just created this super judgmental mindset and we think everyone is just as judgmental as we are to ourselves gt gtyou have to also train your brain to be nicer to yourself and not blame yourself when you feel down about something,3
like i said im just now getting medicine for this i dont think i really needed medicine but my therapist has been trying to get me on medication since last year i finally agreed to it and i took the first dose yesterday morning and the second does this morning i have noticed no changes yet but he told me that it could take a while before anything really changes all ive noticed is how paranoid ive been that they are giving me a placebo i want to get the pills they gave me and open up the capsule just to see if theres anything in there but if there is then is it medicine or sugar maybe its just some sort of powder that doesnt actually do anything what if they are giving me fake medicine are they trying to see if i can change just by believing some miracle pill will do something it feels like theyre trying to disprove my avpd even though they were the ones to diagnose me it didnt help that my therapist told me that he was excited to see what i look like when im medicated what is that supposed to mean i cant tell if he would just be excited to see me improve or if he is trying to test me somehow i dont know i think im thinking about this too much anyone have some advice kind words maybe im going to keep taking the medication unless something bad happens so dont worry about that part,3
hi i have received great response to my recent thread question about successful therapytypes to deal with my avpd im a bit confused about the different therapy paths the different responses have lead me to this follow up topicquestion if you have avpd and experienced success in therapy please answer the following please dont respond if youre a therapist before therapy i and now after therapy i can thx again,3
i feel dumb about this i enjoy watching some of the bravo real housewives shows with my wife however i find watching the rhonj makes me anxious most of the rh shows are based on confrontation but rhonj is the most confrontational as a man with avpd when i see the husbands on that show just about fistfight in confrontation i feel anxious and lessthan i know mist of it is staged but it always leaves me questioning my own manhood ive always been conflict avoidant in fight situation yet im drawn to viewing rh with the hope maybe the guys reactions in that show will help validate my own feelings i know its weird and silly and this is probably the only place in the world where i can vent this tx,3
it is difficult in real life but i play a lot of video games and it is difficult there too i dont know why im so nervous around people i will never know relatable also if you are interested vr chat can be a good place to practice socializing relatively safely lots of internet jerks there fair warning,3
im in my early s and struggle to see things getting better even though i probably have the power somewhere in me to change for the better i guess im just getting impatient and frustrated with myself because of the way i am ive been feeling low again lately and the biggest reason is probably loneliness i wish simply talking to others wasnt a struggle and i wish i didnt view my appearance as objectively terrible amp repulsive i wish i had things to talk about and i wish i was someone people looked forward to seeing and i wish i knew what people thought about me even if very few people have interacted with me i wish i could make a positive impact on someones life the thing is as much as id like to make a friend would the friendship even last considering im over halfway into my university degree people will move away and move on and itll be back to how things were before its probably so dumb that i sometimes feel like death is the best outcome for me as i wouldnt have to live a life of wishful thinking sorry for this cringy post,3
im a year old female and ive had a lot of mental health issues one of them is avpd i struggle to maintain friendships because i always push them away out of fear they will see the real me and i think im an empty person with no personality i never developed my own personality i always mirrored people to fit in i have an intake tomorrow for a rehab clinic im addicted to xanax i think the addiction is just a result of my mental problems that are really complicated and go far back into the past after the rehab i will go to portugal for an intense treatment for months all by my own no phones allowed i think itll do me really good and im glad i have this opportunity i know they arent going to fix my problems and i need to do it myself but it is a big step for me to travel alone to really work on myself its a step forward i have had really bad weeks but this is a little bit of hope for me sorry i just needed to vent and i hope you all are doing okay even if you take baby steps be proud of yourself,3
has anyone here attempted suicide or seriously harmed themselves two days ago i lacerated my wrist with a knife and had to go to the er and get stitches i nearly severed an artery luckily i will make a full recovery but i feel a deep sense of regret and shame that i did this i dont want to get into too much detail but it happened in front of my family i also tried to to choke myself with a piece of clothing and physically assaulted my family as they were trying to stop me from hurting myself i feel most guilty over this as i am normally a very passive person but i let my own emotions take over and didnt stop to think of their wellbeing i do not come from an abusive family at all they love me which is the reason why im not on the streets right now i have been in a really bad mindstate for years now due to isolating myself but this was all my fault and obviously i need to take responsibility for my own actions i have a deep sense of rage underneath myself which i try my best to mask most people who post here seem like good people but i feel like im not im terrified i might be a covert narcissist,3
ok im a f who suffers from a variety of mh stuff so im living with my dad and he has a temper but today i was microwaving something and it exploded with glass and a mess right away i started cleaning it up bc its my fault and he comes yelling that i messed up his microwave and how old i was and a bunch of swears and says hes not dealing with it and as always i internalize it and after i was done cleaning i start crying and thinking about all the ways that i can avoid everything tomorrow if i didnt have my esa with me i would be worse but i dont understand what i should have done as accidents happen and i cleaned it all up and im going to replace the dish that broke i dont understand why he has to treat me horribly im lucky not staying too long bc ill be moving back with my mom in a few months but has anyone else hadhas a parent that treats them this way,3
the idea that i feel i need validation from others unconsciously and am so sensitive to other peoples perceptions is disgusting the repulsion comes from the fact that i know i resonate with it deeply but hate that i do,3
i have social anxiety and avoidant personality so how the fuck am i supposed to tell a stranger that im suicidally depressed because i have no friends and the loneliness makes life unworthy of itself thats a very embarrassing thing to tell someone face to face so yeah i really want therapy at this point because i just want to do everything i can to try get better but theres no fucking way im going to a therapist and telling them im a sad loser with no friends i cant ever ask a waiter for the bill what a pickle,3
i hope its okay that im making a post here without being diagnosed yet im fairly sure i have this disorder because ive looked into it a lot and i resonate so much with what i read online about it im just wondering what people mean when they say this disorder causes a lack of sense of self i have this issue but im not really sure why im usually thinking of it in a social context because it feels like im not enough of a person to make connections but i dont know if its for the same reason you guys might feel that way is it from social inhibition and repressing ourselves so much or something else this is something about myself ive been trying to figure out for awhile,3
at this rate ill just rot in my bed until i eventually die of dehydration i cant get myself to do anything other than scroll on social media and avoid any sort of social interaction whatsoever im scared of people im scared of rejection its hard its kinda shitty too because ngl i was on a roll for like a week but for some reason i just had a sudden episode and now i cant do anything this might be kind of embarrassing but can someone just encourage me i feel like i need some sort of encouragement to function at all thank you in advance,3
i sometimes wonder how different my life would have been if i was a little bit luckier it feels like if you want to beat this thing in some sense you need to be twice as good as them to get half of what they have life feels like a video game most of us play it on a hard difficulty and we are wondering why are we so far behind other people most people are the way they are because they are that way not because they chose and worked hard to be that way do you think outgoing social type of person chose to be that way maybe in some cases but more likely than not it wasnt his choice what made him that type of person but rather circumstances outside of his control things like parenting lack of trauma genetics i dont know if i ever going to beat it and if i dont beat it maybe i shouldnt blame myself,3

i started a new job recently and everyone there is pretty close with each other since theyve worked together for a while and most of them are friendly and helpful all except for this one girl who is helpful to me when i need help but occasionally if she gets stressed out and for her thats pretty often she can be real catty and take it out on others i dont really know how to deal with situations like this when it comes up because im in this subreddit lol i understand shes stressed i dont want to look pathetic in front of others and i want to put up boundaries i dont want to be rude back to her because i really dont want to be that kind of person but i really dont want this to continue i dont know what to do i want to be mature but i dont know if a person like her would be very receptive to that please help if you can,3
i have recently been experimenting with some substances and after three or more days of taking ashwagandha most of my avpd chatter ceases it also dampens my need socialize or seek validation not that i had much of that but at least now i dont care when i run out of things to say during a conversation before i was made uncomfortable by the thought seeming boring or long silence in conversation but with this i dont care at all its a very subtle effect though so i like it im not going to pretend to understand how it works and i definitely dont recommend it because there are several people who have had severe adverse effects with it but i have found a new unintended use for it and i wanted to share this discovery sadly as a sad effect i find myself dragging my feet to do anything i just lose interest in almost everything,3
hi i suspect i may have avpd or something related to it id like to preface this post by saying that i started reading up on this disorder about an hour ago so clearly im not going to jump to any conclusions here or at least im not trying to i just think its possible i also have adhd and im on a waitlist to be tested for autism if that helps ive struggled with severe anxiety issues for years almost all of them are related to how people are perceiving mei have intense anticipatoryperfomance anxiety i fear that people are either going to think i act strangely think im stupidincompetent or both which will lead to a general dislike this fear has grown so large i assume most new people i come in contact with dislike me think im odd and talk behind my back it got so bad that i dropped out of high school and havent been able to hold a job since i get overwhelmed very easily a combination of aforementioned fears and sensory overload ive been unemployed for a long while because the idea of even searching for or applying to jobs sounds hopeless and its ruining my life i always wanted to go to college growing up but im frozen with fear and unable to attempt going i fear that even people very close to me that ive been friends with for years are talking behind my back and they dont really want me around i love interacting with people for example my mutuals on social media sites but i become fearful when they get closer to me and we interact more often because im afraid that they wont actually like me if we chat one on one i wont fit into their group of friends theyre just pretending to like me theyll think im stupid etc etc i have such an intense fear of rejection at every turn oftentimes hitting hard enough to feel physically painful im doubtful because sometimes i can talk to people fine the fear is in the back of my mind and sometimes it presents itself far more plainly but other times i dont have any issues interacting with people talking to new people is also way easier since itd be far more upsetting if someone im already attached to decided they didnt like me and abandoned me i also identify with borderline symptoms yet i constantly fear theyre not severe enough i would fall into the quiet bpd subtype i rarely lash out i isolate myself and agonize over my interpersonal relationships and the state of my life sorry for the oversharing i can elaborate or answer any questions just please let me know what you think anything is helpful edit id like to add that im seeking a psychologist right now im not in the absence of professional help i just want to know what people who actually have it think,3
in th grade i moved to another state for about months then i moved back to where i was up until my first or second year of highschool and then i moved again i feel like this might be what cemented my social stagnation i pretty much ghosted everyone i knew and every time i thought i was putting roots down i had to relocate although i didnt really have many friends but it still hurt because my mother didnt want anyone to know we were moving i just had to vanish after losing friends and not having a stable environment i think i pretty much gave up and have been a homebodyshutin ever since i wonder if this could contribute to avpd im not officially diagnosed yet by the way,3
so theres a situation that occurred and its tearing me apart from the inside im absolutely terrible at showing emotions and making a move hence my terminal aloneness i wish it was terminal last year during the summer i temporarily got to experience what it was like to be wanted a coworker and i became friends and she seemed to express interest in me time and time id go hang out with her only to go home banging my head in frustration and wondering wtf was going on heres my only other post about her for reference httpswwwredditcomravpdcommentswussituationinvolvingmarriedcoworkerutmsourceshareamputmmediumandroidappamputmnameandroidcssamputmtermamputmcontentsharebutton tldr of old post shes married but they are about to separate over issues theyve had for years for those that think im being scummy maybe but shes leaving the country for good next month without him meanwhile shes seemingly expressed interest in me while at the same time holding me at arms length away she tells me all of these personal things about herself including some secrets she says shes never told anyone however if she gives me a hug its half hearted most of the time but with other guys like the one she said weirded her out she is willing to fully embrace them heres a worse part i have a car and she cant drive so when she needed things shed pretend to want to hang out and go check something out usually then wed go back to her place and shed cook something for me and i wouldnt feel it was a total loss getting food for the gas spent but the last two times i went over there she kept going on and on about how tired she was so i left basically having been used as a free uber but heres the worst part the other day on valentines day i called her up and shes busy chatting with strangers on omegle this one guy is flirting with her and she keeps telling me about how good he looks and how he wants to do an online video date with her clothes optional the whole time shes giggling and basically ignoring what im saying so i say ive got something to do and hang up she has the fucking nerve to call me back and want a ride somewhere before she goes home to get some rest i keep it short and civil what choice do people like us have and basically hang up and go to bed the next day i texted her to ask how did your little edate go she responded huh and i havent talked to or heard from her since highly unusual because she always calls me several times on my days off those days are over and i feel an incredible amount of stress about it my heart is going crazy and i feel like im waiting to get punished by the principle or something i guess i lost whatever that was life never wastes an opportunity to kick me when im down,3
ive always found gps really unhelpful and clueless when it comes to anything mental health related i want to talk to a professional and get assessed but id have to get referred through a gp and if gps arent even educated in adhd and anxiety i doubt theyd know anything about avpd,3
hello all this is my second post in here now ampxb ive had my official diagnose lowfunctioning avpd i dont exactly know how to feel about it it makes sense all too much sense i wonder if i couldve turned out better if i had been diagnosed earlier since ive basically wasted my entire life so far only good part was some part of my th grade since it was a private school that had good experience with a bit different kids not a specialschool but nevertheless a good school for me ampxb well looking forward at least i have this diagnosis now and i have somewhere to start from ill be looking to get my doctors reference to a psychologist to hopefully make some progress with all of this even though im a complete hermit who is not at all good at getting daily things done i do have at least a bit of hope of turning some things around i still have hope that i can make progress for the better but its going to be hard ampxb i wish you all the best as well from the bottom of my heart,3
im bullied and treated like im subhuman everywhere i go i dont think itd be possible for me to improve myself and change how i am im subhuman and thats not going to change anytime soon i think about suicide everyday and i hate myself beyond measure,3
i lost touch with an acquaintance well she chose not wanting to see me because she sort of blames her mental health on me which i did not cause i literally did nothing to this woman she was into literature and writing and i encouraged her writing a little and we both knew about each others anxiety we didnt talk about our problems though she shared she had social anxiety she knew i had generalized anxiety but that has improved greatly for me now that was the extend of us knowing about each others problems she decided me having anxiety equated to me being a negative person and that is actually not true she doesnt even know me well enough to determine what kind of person i am so that is part of what upset me the other part is just the way she went about the situation i have zero interest in ever reconnecting with her the trust wouldnt be there and id always be fearful of saying something wrong or of being hurt again see it shouldnt hurt so much just from a little ol acquaintance but it did hurt so much when you live so close to each other and end up in the same public spaces at times it is awkward and somehow i feel like i am in the wrong for being there when i have every right to be in public spaces,3
my childhood assessment showed that i have been suffering from avoidant personality disorder generalized anxiety disorder social anxiety disorder and selective mutism in the last year my doctor has prescribed antianxiety medication such as buspirone and pregabalin to help me feel relaxed and hopefully make me more confident to communicate with people outside of my family however until now i am still very nervous and terrified of talking to people outside of my family in this way apart from making me unable to make friends i am also too nervous for interviews making it difficult for me to find a job please advise me on how to overcome my symptoms of avoidant personality disorder selective mutism or anxiety disorder so that i can join the workforce,3
i feel like im stuck in a never ending loophole i dont know what i am anymore i think about my personality a lot why am i like this at times i feel like this strong confident person and at others i feel the complete opposite i remember i used to feel some type of connection with people now i dont anymore no matter how close they can be im never fully comfortable with simplest shit i never give out a true answer maybe i dont know the actual answer myself im talking the simplest dumbest situations where im asked to express myself about a certain thing i often deny that i have any problems with my personality and that i am completely fine and this is all a delusion in my head and sometimes i feel like this completely mentally broken person with avpd sa depression did etc this can happen multiple times a day its exhausting to keep shifting through these completely different mentalities this often i feel like im losing my mind like who the fuck am i anymore,3
so i am currently in college for nursing ive been practically a hermit of a stay at home mom since i thought maybe i could get past my anxious feelings of making friends in once i got to school but its turning into the same thing all over again i have in person class days a week and i met a girl who was open about her mental health we clicked and i thought great i can do this i can make a friend we even exchanged numbers which is huge for me we texted a little but then in class she went from sitting next to me to jokingly saying id rather be next to insert classmates name now i have tried to be chill with this other classmate too we had a similar dark sense of humor but then the past two classes i felt like a third wheel like the first girl just started to distance and almost mean yet she asks me to study with her and the other i amso confused and also feel like they are pitying me like i just wanted to flee the class and sob because i felt like once again people automatically shut me out bc of my quirks idk if this is an avpd thing or an autistic thing i just feel defeated and alone i so desperately want a friend,3
i am formally diagnosed with avoidant personality disorder tendencies my therapist and general practitioner both believe that its caused bycomorbid with inattentive adhd but there is no formal diagnosis for that yet i am taking adderall mg xr for it though and it is the only thing that has ever helped me how the hell do i deal wit this hellish combination ive deconstructed and deconstructed but the only point i can reach is that i understand why and when things are happening and that theyre irrational but i cant change it i have a handful of fixationshobbiespotential professions that i jump between and i never know if i can trust myself to know what i want i feel like im at an urgent crossroads in deciding what to do with my life and im unable to stick to one idea is it adhd distracting me with a new shiny thing is it avpd ghosting my previous interest due to perceived failureinvalidation is it both working in tandem i envy people who can dedicate hours a day to a single thing for upwards of a year video game speedrunners come to mind specifically thats not something i am interested in but i am beyond jealous of the ability to sit and do one single thing for ludicrous amounts of time and perfect it anyone else experience this sick little combo,3
recently i noticed i was people pleasing too hard and decided to try a little less i was too clingy was the one to wait after class to go together was the one to write first etc my friend usually doesnt do the same and as someone with rejection sensitivity predictably it hurt so when i stopped trying so hard my friend seemed hurt she said something about me not waiting for her like i usually do admittedly it felt good to finally let go a little and have some selfrespect but i also feel so bad for being kinda petty i dont think she did all this on purpose because overall she is a really good and caring friend maybe i just frustrated her with being too clingy in the past,3
i feel like before i really longed to be part of the group i longed to have someone who would choose me over the others i longed to be someone just like anyone else but somehow nowadays i dont really want that anymore im just so used to being alone in the group alone at work and anywhere else that i just prefer to be alone it feels like a burden to be a part of something i prefer to do my thing in the group like at work but i dont want to get mentally attached to anyone i dont know if its a survival mechanism to protect my own mental health or if its just because im tired of trying to belong to somewhere maybe i have just accepted who i am and what will never be does anyone else feel the same i dont mean this to be a negative post as i dont feel sad about this im just stating how things are and ive somehow made peace with it maybe in the future it can make me feel sad but not atm anyways,3
i struggle with extreme avpd ive been to therapy for years with many different people and i just feel like im sinking lower and lower as time goes by it has gone too far and now im in a situation where i struggle to even open the front door or open my mouth to speak ive lost the few friends i had years ago cause of the severe anxiety i felt and the panic attacks i had after meeting them i live with my dad but i rarely talk to him cause even that is too hard for me i studder opon my words and feel like i cant even have a regular conversation with my own parents without the severe stress i feel i feel so hopeless and fragile all i wanna do is keep caging myself inside my room with my distractions but im also incredibly unbearably lonely and ache for genuine human connection but i know id never be able to have that in the near future if ever,3
i swear some of the reasons ive come up with in order to avoid meeting people its so crazy like why cant this creative energy be harnessed anywhere else for example ive literally riden a minute bus to a place walked right up to the door then heard the dreadful sound of people inside and thats all it took for me to make a and ride that same bus back home the reason in my head was like hmm theyre meeting next week so i can just wait until then surely i will do it next time d its just ahhhhhhhhh i hate myself man why why why why why why why why why am i like this and the thing is i really need the socialization too like im so freaking lonely the instant i arrive back home im like shit i really shouldve just gone in now i have nothing to do again why did i listen to myself and it just makes me even more depressed thinking about how pathetic i am,3
can anyone relate to this no advice please so i dont live alone i live a single family member that sometimes has their boyfriend over i also do work part time in retail which is all i can currently handle our schedules usually allow me enough time alone even if i want more of it summer is a lot better for me because i can comfortably go outside in spaces where ill be just as alone so its extremely rare that i have these attacks during it to get to the point there are some weeks in winter that are a perfect storm for avpd our schedules will clash where theyll be home every single moment i am for almost a week on end for the first days ill get a bit more irritable but handle things and still do ordinary things that involve other people hearing me like music or watching youtube videos and keep up with people well enough online though it starts to snowball on usually the way it comes on is almost like a physical illness i suddenly feel extremely on edge in the background ill start not listeningwatching anything and avoiding doing anything outside my room hypervigilance shoots through the roof my mood begins to swing like a pendulum really snappy and in general humanexe stops working i wont even be able to really handle having discord open usually comes with tension aches too in my body here and there if i even have to go out and get the mail i become a mental train wreck i wont be able to handle being outside even if no one else is out without being on the edge of a panic attack just going into a different room becomes an anxiety ridden chore going to work as you can imagine as i must force my way through it is an absolute nightmare as you might expect the anxiety and irritability completely socially cripples me to add to the embarrassment so i go through the usual motions like an npc to the best of my ability and use that break time very strategically based on how time usually feels there if im lucky ill loosen up a bit much later at night enough to watch some youtube or enjoy some quieter music the only way i found to cheat it which costs a little money unfortunately is to order takeout food later for some reason home cooked food doesnt work i guess its because i have to do that here with them around and have my usual comfort ritual of watching some youtube as i eat hoping someone is streaming something i like after that i may feel alone enough somehow to enjoy some music and mindlessly fart around on the internet since the only factor is that it just involves someone elses comfort food they made for me i have no idea why this works its impossible for this to go on more than a week cause schedules break it up after a week and give me back that time but it can take me a day on my own completely to recover i noticed this specific family member being home with me too long is the trigger though i dont know if its just them or others that can trigger these episodes too its as if i become to opposite world nightmare version of myself because normally despite my avpd and cptsd im much more positive and bubbly in personality as long as im self medicated correctly and have just enough space i tend to do ok socially i feel more like a wounded extrovert than anything since i desire close connections but at the same time i avoid everything that would lead to any being formed because i feel closed in on very quickly theres a lot of tug of war that goes on with me internally like this,3
i recently signed up for uni and the first two weeks have been okay if only im only slightly disappointed for not doing more to talk to other people and befriend them i still managed to befriend two or three people i try my best to talk to them but even just greeting them makes me feel anxious because what if they didnt want to greet me or they didnt want to talk to me or theyre talking with someone else clearly closer to them than me or at least more interesting so i end up feeling out of place because i cant gather the courage to talk more while they all befriend each other despite all of these feelings i kept pushing through and this last weekend i managed to ask one of my classmates friends who i considered myself to be the closest to to hang out and they accepted it went well we talked a lot and in the moment it felt like we were having fun but when i came back home all of these awful feelings that maybe they were uncomfortable and didnt really want to hang out with me or talk to me and they were just being polite and nice or maybe they were just trying to see how it would be like to hangout with me realizing im more of a nuisance and a bore than its worth to keep around started consuming my mind i tried to push these thoughts in the back of my mind as much as i could but today i already went to class with all of these thoughts filling my mind i saw my friend enter class but i couldnt bring myself to talk to them not even a single greeting nothing and i felt like a piece of shit for not trying more because surely they thought i was rude for not saying anything they were talking normally to other people during break time and i envied all of them i wish i could talk so easily with other people befriending them i wish i wouldnt be scared of saying anything in fears of being ignored so i ended up feeling out of place again despite my desires to fit in i thought maybe at least wed have the chance to talk after class no all i could manage to mutter was a halfcut word before they said goodbye even if smiling and walked up to someone else to talk to them my logic says everything is okay and today they were simply on a rush after class but my avpd says they absolutely hate me and dont want to do anything with me anymore i feel like i messed up big time and that i lost a potential friend i feel like i lost all my chances of having friends ever again even and i know its my fault because i should have talked more but when i talk more im scared to scare them all away i hate how hard it is to simply say hello and ask someone how theyre doing i feel like ill be seen as a weirdo and ignored even if the person is a friend so i dont know what to do sorry for the long rant sorry if i used the wrong flair too i dont normally post anywhere i just really needed to vent,3
im single approaching s have a stable job and stable family getting more skilled at my job recently really helped boost my confidence and im used to being a nonvoluntary lone ranger i thought nothing could hurt me anymore yet today something simple triggered me someone i joined the company with got married yet i was not invited but few others were this is not the first time this has happened i can count on one hand how many times someone invited me and not as a second thought also the embarrassment when i only learned someones wedding is coming when having a random group lunch and learning i was not invited yet trying to sidestep others question if im coming i always think they have a separate group chat with majority of them and always wondering why im not included maybe im too boring and not prettyfashionable like them ive long come to terms with the fact that people are just not interested in me since i was a teenager always not being invited being left out of information or plain rejected to my face i never have a romantic relationship and no guys ever show interest in me all the vague friends term i use whenever i talk to my mother to hide the fact that her daughter was all alone ever since she entered university it just hurts so bad and reminds me so much of my teenage years one day i wish ill have a partner who always puts me first in his thoughts thanks for reading my rant,3
to those of you who have tried antidepressants to mitigate this condition did you find that they were helpful if so were there any brands in particular that worked well i know this is highly individualistic but would like to know if certain ones worked better than others it something that i have been putting off for a while now however ive gotten to the point where it probably wouldnt be a bad idea to give them a shot but i never wanted to deal with all the side effects interested to hear your experience on this,3
never been diagnosed with avpd as i am too scared of asking my therapist what he thinks since by his writing he doesnt seem to care much about pd labels and im too afraid i will look like one of those people who tries to be cutequirkyuniquespecial by hunting for diagnoses but i resonate a lot with the stories and thoughtsfeelings i have read from people who have avpd and a lot of it sounds like things i have saidthoughtfelt almost word for word im curious if anyone here can relate to my childhood or if im being overdramatic i wont go into it too much because no one cares about my stupid sob story about why im a loser but i basically had a very emotionally dismissive mom its your fault for being upset and an explosively angry father taught me it was never ok to say no since both of them worked all day i was pretty much raised by my older halfsister who had issues of her own obviously and she would constantly bully and belittle me my halfbrother essentially ignored me when i was growing up i was also constantly bullied in elementarymiddle school for being weird and shy and had to see therapists that i didnt want to talk to when i was as young as years old im years old and have never datedkissedhad sex with anyone and have never made any attempt to do so i dont have any friends except on the internet i used to think a partner and friends were things i wanted but thinking about it now i feel like either as a result of my upbringing or maybe some other brain failure im really not capable of loving anyone im not even sure if i love any members of my family i can also never be comfortable in a room with someone else no matter how long i have known them for because anything that would involve me being me i would need to be alone for anyone relate or am i just a sociopath,3
so i feel sexually compulsive i feel energy drained stress accumulated leading to failure stress about just anything in general too much of it difficult to have own opinion i doubt if i even agree on the way that i feel or think about a certain topic at times i believe this stems from stress depressed sometimes i just feel like all the light and life has been sucked out of me at random times occurs usually when im around people and gives me a feeling of desolation like i am emotionally alone in my own world i want to finish this with a little bit of food for thought of what i have come to a conclusion is what doubt has done in your life and mine guys think of any moment youve felt doubt remove moments of doubt which you can be sure of where the doubt came from like at school while taking a test now every other moment where the reason for the stress feels out there in the galaxy thats where i strongly feel stress inhibits us and we dont even bat an eye and question it but why question why you are stressed isnt this just part of who i am i should learn to live with it its so difficult to live this way we are so intermingled with stress that it just becomes a part of us and sadly we stop seeing it this way for whatever reason we have but doubt lives upstairs from us casting a cloud over us every time it kicks and stomps over our thoughts and our ambitions into what feels like uncaring mundanity,3
so yesterday i had a therapy session and the therapist asked why i think i have no friends i answered i have interests that few share where i live as i live in a small city so it is hard to have friends or form relations based on interests also i have no interest in sports and that is the common interest where i live i told him i am part of many online communities but i just lurk as i feel that i dont belong enough to participate in these communities even if they are based on my interests at that moment i remembered reddit and this community and i felt that i already have a community where i can freely be who i am without fear when i joined reddit it was for something tech related then i said why not searching for avoidant and i was expecting nothing but to my surprise i found this sub and it was unbelievable as it is hard to find anything related to avoidant i was new to reddit and navigating it but i was happy as i found people like me as i kept browsing i started to get related more and more to your posts i felt a connection to you and i realized i am not alone anymore knowing i am not alone anymore is one of the greatest things anyone can ask for it meant i have people who can understand me and my struggle and what i am going through people who can understand me and i can understand them people with who i can share whatever i want knowing they will understand me and wont judge me in this communityi dont hesitate or feel shy to share anything with you from sharing memes to asking questions and seeking help and advice here i share my problems and secrets that no one knows including my family i finally found a home here and family this community really seems like an oasis in the desert i have more to say about this community but i want to keep this post short as possible i feel blessed that i found you and being part of this community i just wish i could meet you or some of you in the real world and to newcomers welcome abroad in one way or another you arent alone anymore,3
ill try to keep this brief as i tend to ramble on about how much i pity myself i just feel like no matter how much work i put in it will never be enough i have been getting out of my comfort zone lately and putting myself into more social situations but the more i do it the more disillusioned i become i think that even if the fear and anxiety i feel with socializing was removed id still only ever be able to interact on a superficial level its like a fundamental part of me is missing it feels like the best i can ever hope for is to function in society at a basic level sorry to be a melodramatic downer im just feeling really low today and wanted to put my thoughts out there maybe someone can relate thanks for listening,3
i cant take it anymore i dont know how to reach out to people online to make friends let alone my classmates in real life my parents only ever want to talk to my sister on the phone im so isolated and deprived of any attention or social interaction i feel like im going completely fucking crazy i dont even know where to begin getting help through therapy i know the first step is to even take a step at all but i just get so paralyzed by terror i cant do anything whatsoever my college has some counseling program theyre partnered with in this city but i dont know how to reach out and beg for help i dont even know what words to use i need a script or something im and i dont have a single close friend every time i take a personality quiz that has a question along the lines of how many close friends do you have and there isnt an option for zero a part of my soul dies my boyfriend that i only stayed with out of fear of making him mad by breaking up with him broke up with me a couple weeks ago and the only social interaction i had whatsoever following that was extremely explicit anonymous sexual harassment on tumblr that still makes my skin crawl to think about but i didnt tell them to stop until a different anon said hey dont you think this is kinda predatory because i didnt want to be the killjoy by asking for it to stop and anyway i was probably overreacting about the whole thing to begin with but now that thats over since i blocked a few of them and turned anon off im back to zero socialization whatsofuckingever every desperate cry for help feels like im just screaming into a vacuum i dont know how to get out of this fucking hole im trapped in im too goddamn spineless to claw my way out can anyone hear me i just want someone to acknowledge me directly for once i just want my classmates to invite me to lunch again they used to invite me daily last year but at some point it feels like they just gave up on trying to get me involved and now its all my fault i still dont have any fucking friends at this point i dont even want to blame the avpd i just want to blame myself for letting this shit perpetuate in my brain so much its like i let a mold spread in here and now its in all the wrinkles in my brain fuck,3
my old posthttpswwwredditcomravpdcommentszwcohgodihaveadate hi everyone since you all were so kind i wanted to share my experience the date went okay but she kind of felt distant to me afterwards shorter answers not really engaging in text chats it felt like she had no interest so i stopped texting her last wednesday after a dance class some people went to a bar in the same building i chatted with her and some other people it was quite nice afterwards we had the same way home so we walked together and kept talking she talked about some mental health problems she had and how she was dealing with it therapy and so on she was quite open and frank later when i was at home i thought about how she was in person compared to the text messages my picture of her had changed a bit previously i would have said she was quite the confident woman i still think she is though but afterwards i saw that she also had internal struggles and insecurities so i today decided to ask her again if shed like to meet for a coffee she texted me back that she thinks im really sweet and its always fun talking with me but her life is too full right now and she has no place right now for another friendship or something deeper shed like to keep it at the dance lessons and socials she is sorry thats probably not the answer i was hoping for but she is just trying to being honest i wrote back that it wasnt the answer i hoped for but i thought i would get i thought she was a great person and find her to be pretty awesome so i had to write her so thats it im a bit sad now although i knew this would be coming still its better to be in the clear ive given up some hope to find a partner its so hard not to be frustrated or be frustrated live through the frustration and get out of it on top my few relationships began during those very rare moments in my life where i was truly happy a condition that feels unreachable at the moment this makes it feel impossible to find love i try to be the best person i can be but it never feels enough,3
i can said i have hight functioning avpd i go to work teach my classes im constantly wanting to improve and develop a strong career path and get enough money for surviving in a latin american country but a few things happened while in quarantine i was depressed isolated with my family grieving that a part of my body wasnt functioning well and got removed that destroyed me and on top of that my religious trauma and the stupid comments of my mother who things all the things need to be her way or not be at all she hurt me terribly anyways as i isolated i created a new perspective of shame and was constantly bullied by neighbors for my attitudes and behaviors as i was bragging a lot due to my financial and career position were higher than of those adults around me just at i know thats awful and was against my original principles but i think i just tried to cope im more mature i recognize it was a mechanism to avoid rejection and shame like you can laugh or make comments about me but you are average and im not i started working at higher education by the time i feel so much shame after all that happened and my avoidant traits have gotten even worse i barely leave the home i just go to my job go home and repeat the cycle everyday i am going through some medical difficulties nowdays and i have to come to the realization that i cant live like this anymore this is not life i dont do anything else apart from working and existing i cannot practice any hobbies or watch anything cuz i think that if i sing in portuguese or spanish or english somebody on the other side of the wall is gonna be ready to laugh at me i dont even talked to my parents unless i feel sure nobody could hear us sometimes i try doing something and past memories come to hunt me i tried moving out on my own but the fear of being judge for being a female living alone and not talking to anyone has taken me out of the apartment and ive been paying it for two months now without living there putting as an excuse that once i recover more from a recent surgery i had ill go back to my place bless your heart if you took the time to read all these mess,3
i had a weird childhood where i feel to this day like a lot of my own relatives dont know the real me and it makes me sad to think about and i wonder what caused that my own cousins dont really talk to me they are a bit older and have different life situations but still i have vague memories of things that couldve went wrong looking back maybe some conflicts but its so unclear im not sure is anyone else here able to relate,3
alright before i start i want to say that im ive been showing some symptoms as long as i can remember but i hate self diagnosis so i want some help because i dont want to have a pdobviously ive been extremely shy and untrusting of others ever since i was a small child im often rude and cold to people bc im extremely afraid of someone talking to me and try to make them think im not talking to them bc im arrogant and not a loser whos afraid of everyone but im more like the second ive always been insecure also i had a history of self harm but i did that because i feel like im not enough and dont deserve to even breath the same air as most people not because im suicidal i had suicidal thoughts a lot but i never considered doing it because im too much of a coward for it i also project my insecurities on people a lot and try to find someone inferior to me to communicate ive felt inferior for so long that i want to be superior to someone so i project my insecurities and drag them down im not jelaous by any means i just want someone inferior to me i dont think i even need to mention i have no friends and push anyone that tries to talk to me bc i suspect theyre bullying me but i have good relations with my family even though they also make me a little anxious and i have a diagnosis of gad,3
ive only recently discovered my disorder falls into avpd of characteristics ive been going to a psychiatrist for years whos treated me for depression zoloft ive always been shy overly self critical etc ive been to therapists over the last years none have really helped me weve identified the causes of my avpd very critical parents physical abuse sexual abuse in jr high however thats a far as i get the rest is just talking about my feelings i get to mos in and i feel like im just saying the same stuff so i quit has any avpdsufferers ever had success with therapy what does success look like i cant even imagine are you more socially successful and bulletproof from criticism what methods did you use in therapy that made you successful what did you do beyond talking about your traumas that helped you what kind of therapist was helpful in getting passed or improving is there some specialization or kind of therapist that is more successful with avpd thx,3
to me the idea of being in a relationship like that is the ultimate danger as the level of intimacy in that dynamic is as high as it can possibly be in life it is just hard to comprehend myself being able to deal with something like that because the fear is overwhelming for this reason this is one of the hardest things for me to work on despite making inroads in other respects i have learned to personally engage with people in a platonic way although i have a sort of mental dissonance that keeps most social interactions at a superficial level but it seems like that is not a possibility with romance which is why i have not been able to adapt or understand how to even go about it this is why like many other posts i have come across on here i have virtually no experience at im wondering how others have even begun to be able to make an effort to seek one or even be in one as the possibility of rejection and having to be emotionally open is amplified i realize that avpd obviously is an individualized experience and other social dynamics might be more difficult for others and this is not me saying that i believe those in relationships are lying about their diagnosis of course its just moreso that i have a difficult time relating and understanding how you guys who have succeeded in this have made this progress,3
school sucks all i do is hide the bathroom every break time to avoid social interactions because i also know there isnt anywhere to go or sit if there is a place in the library i hope that nobody sits next to me or looks at me i think people stare at me but when i look up theyre not i wish school days went faster and feel like i get anxiety attacks i avoid making friends at school because i feel inferior to people like i dont deserve them and theyre much better having someone else as a friend than me because i have social skills and stress to maintain friendships i try to seem mildly interesting by having hobbies but i know it isnt enough i sometimes feel severely lonely and depressed at school and at home but try to distract myself from that i dont speak a word at school somedays i dissociate and everything feels like this isnt my home or im dreaming i think this is just general social anxiety but do any of you relate btw im not trying to self diagnose i just need some help,3
who am i talking to why am i talking to theres no one here this is a faceless screen a faceless website theres no one actually here no one can hear me no one can see me either i dont exist you dont exist im not actually talking to anyone its just my phone or my laptop talking back to me every day no one actually will hear me where am i how did i get here why do i even feel emotionally attached to some voices coming from my phone you lot dont exist i dont exist,3
its my birthday tomorrow my family wants to throw a party for me and my twin brother they said to invite our friends and theyll invite the rest of the family and our cousins we havent seen in a while my brother doesnt have avpd all his friends are coming i had a friend but i avoided him i have no one to inviteits my birthday tomorrow and im feeling like doing some avoidant shit,3
shes been a friend of mine for years shes caring loyal and shes always been there for me but she has this habit if shes upset shell ignore the shit out of me shell snap at me for the smallest of things without warning ive told her she has the right to be upset and express herself but she can give me a heads up instead of ignoring me and making me feel guilty i feel like im walking on eggshells around her i asked this on a avpd reddit because i already feel lonely i cant imagine losing her as well what do i do,3
so i went to the shop today to collect an order i told the cashier my name an so on the thing is there werent really any thoughts going around in my head and i tried to be so confident but still felt terrible the entire time my body become really stiff and uncomfortable the entire time i was there like i really try to become better but how can i shake this sensation,3
ive looked at my analytics over the past years from the day i marked down as all the shit starting and i couldnt believe it i dont even want to give the sum here because im ashamed but its a lot and the point is ive been receiving money from my nparents as an allowance i didnt even have a job i didnt even go to school i could save it spend it on whatever i want i dont even want to leave my house anymore right now,3
i still have some sertraline a lot of cipralex a lot of depakine almost an entire box of abilify a little over two sheets of seroquel and the corpses of all the klonopin in my town sigh god i miss klonopin,3
i have always struggled making friends developing deeper relationships and feeling safe in friendships once a friendship starts to develop into something deeper i run the other way i think im so scared of being rejected that i reject myself before it can happen to me or catch me off guard i think im also paranoid that people are just being polite and no one actually likes me especially if i pick up on any tiny clues that this might be the case clues look like friends not texting in a while friends not inviting me to something hanging out with other friends without me or just some way that i interpret their communication or tone does anyone experience this and how do you keep from running the other way when you cant interpret if youre truly wanted as a friend or if you need to back off do i just need to take a leap of faith,3
i dont know if anyone else here feels like this but ive noticed that the thought of having to reject someone i dont like is also feeding my avoidance at this point i already know that im not compatible with of the people near me i cant connect i have some niche interests and different beliefs and values compared to most of the people where i live finding someone i really like is something that happens one time in years and even though i know they exist it is very rare for me to find them the thing is sometimes people see me being more reclusive and think is just because im shy i guess they feel pityempathy for who they think i am so they start trying to socialize with me but the truth is i am willingly distancing because i dont see anything in common with them or sometimes see things that actually annoy me but i feel so uncomfortable rejecting their attempt specially if we have to see each other a lot even if i know nothing that satisfies me will come from there because i have experienced the pain of rejection a lot of times i feel empathy for them or as i said for what i think they will feel when rejected which is the same pain ive felt in the past but i also think theres also a factor of fear of judgement and therefore rejection i guess here because im afraid they will find me arrogant rude mean superficial someone with a superiority complex or just straight up be mad at me i have this good girl syndrome and the thought of someone thinking bad of me is so excrutiating that just doing what is more comfortable for the others and not for me seems to be easier but of course its not being sustainable on the long run so yeah nowadays im also avoiding social interaction and new relationships because i know that ill probably not like or be compatible with the person am afraid of being judgedrejected and also of having to reject,3
hi im not sure if this is an avpd thing or a cptsd thing but i have a strong rejection of any physical touch thats comforting or affectionate im permanently tense and hypervigilant and i now have a lovely dog who is so loving but i notice i basically reject her affection of leaning against me by tensing up ive tried letting go and accepting the comfort of her touch but it leaves me feeling very strange and uneasy my dog is very smart and notices the miniscule flexes of my muscles and my pushing back at her and will either walk away or try harder to love me affiliate with me by persisting with her leaning against me with a little bit more weight shes quite a teacher like that and could maybe help me learn to accept loveaffiliation the same has happened with professional physical massages i would be body armouring against the touch and tensing up and trying to push away the masseur instead of relaxing and accepting the physical touch and enjoying that experience i have a feeling this is related to an early life trauma thing but i was wondering if any one with avpd relates to this i dont know why i feel so repulsed by physical contact it makes me feel squirmish and so uncomfortable in danger almost often if i initiate it and am slightly dissociated i can do it but theres a wall there preventing it from being too authentic or entirely organic essentially going through the motions without mindfulness due to the layer of dissociation in the forefront then there are other times when i can genuinely be affectionate for a short while to my dog giving her a stroke or cuddle without being dissociated instead mindful however after a little while this is when i think avpd comes into play as i then start to think i suck at being affectionate and that my dog thinks im an idiot or annoying or needy or something so total lack of self confidence comes into play my experience of touch is kind of like comforting a strangerin my experience youre not in the moment as youre not sure what to do to be there for them except im like this with giving all friendlyinformalaffectionate touch and receiving it seems to scare me it confuses me and makes me feel incredibly vulnerable and i rebel against it from the very core of my psyche and body i can feel like a child perhaps toddler age inside me trying to fight off an opposing force when i am touched which makes me think its a traumacptsd thing wish i knew how to work with it i get overwhelmed no therapist currently things like i will start stroking the dog as its happy to see me and wagging its tail but then when the tail stops wagging ill instantly feel like ive done something wrong or the dog isnt enjoying the attention failuredefective schemas or low selfesteem simply so i then try stroking her somewhere else or give up gt im sure a therapist could help me navigate this quite easily i do have times when it works i can be affectionate and not crumble in failure if the dog is non responsive i guess the other times im seeking validation that im being comforting the times it works cohesivelynaturally are getting easier with practise but i dont know any tools or practical ways to get better at it when im not feeling like it most of the time i just want to be alone and this dog is very affectionate and i dont want to fail at being reciprocate and of course this is all prelude to having human relationships which are infinitely more complex,3
i went out to throw garbage in the middle of the night today it was dark outside and there was no one there and i was not scared at all i might have been scared in the past but now i hope that some ghost will appear to accompany me because i really is it too afraid of humans and too lonely is there the same,3
i cant find anything on google about this but sometimes it feels like people are lowkey putting me down by whistling its very annoying,3
i am years old never had a job never moved out of my parents house have only one friend and have never been in a relationship im so ashamed of myself but at the same time i have no motivation to change and am so depressed all i ever wanna do is sleep or lay in bed playing games and watching youtube is anyone else like this if you were and were able to make changes ie get a job move out was a difficult to make friends did people ridicule you and reject you once they found out how pathetic you were,3
how often do you get them do you make them whats your reaction on compliments,3
ive always felt extremely anxious around people and unfortunately due to covidquarantine ive gotten really used to and fond of being alone ive have friends but im horrible to them i feel extremely guilty about it but i just dont know what to do i constantly avoid going places with them by coming up with really elaborate excuses i dont let them know anything about me or my personal life either but theyve always for some reason have come to me for advice and to vent i dont necessarily dislike when they do that but im not opening up to them about myself and i think im hurting them in the process the idea of me having friends or even a romantic relationship sounds really nice in theory but the moment anyone shows any sort of initiative to become my friend i immediately become exhausted or even sometimes annoyed i feel like such a deeply horrible person because of my cowardliness since i dont ever express this to anyone i just dont know what to do i want to be alone but i also want someone to care for me and i care for them but i realistically just dont see that happening to me maybe i dont deserve it i really dont know this all sounds really convoluted but if anyone relates or has any advice please let me know,3
hello everyone hope youre all having a good one i went to best buy today to pick up a new phone and im ngl it was quite stressful i had my phone for about years and it was time for an upgrade the whole process of trading in my phone was so stressful because not only was the employee kinda anxiety inducing to deal with but he trashed my sim card by messing around with the sim tray on my old phone and tried to say my phone was too old and that i can buy a new one because theyre cheap so after all that mess i had to walk to my carrier and the closest one was closed i was kinda shaking at this point because i felt like my whole day was going wrong but i got kinda brave and took an uber to the other side of town to replace my sim card i lived to tell this tale lol tldr upgraded phone but best buy employee trashed my sim card so had to journey all over town to get a new one,3
ive always been terrified of driving and get extremely anxious especially in new areas or high traffic areas driving with other people in the car also gives me anxiety does anyone else get this or is it just a me thing,3
im not an extrovert i dont want attention im okay with being silent i hate small talk i want deep connections that come from a place of mutual patience and empathy and im sorry to admit this so late but i wont find that with like of people it just is how it is what ill try to work on ill allow myself to fail stutter or mumble when i dont feel comfortable talking in groups but ill talk nonetheless when i have something to say so that i can practice that which im not good at which means ill allow myself to feel discomfort deep discomfort and shame which i know will lessen one day or ill get used to the feelings ill allow myself to be intimate with people i feel comfortable with and to warn them when i feel like fleeing and hiding the right people will understand and wont give up so easily ill accept failure expect disappointment and revel in misery because i know it will lead me to something better than this dark void ive been living in the last years of my life thank you,3
if you ask me what my hobbies are i cant name any if you ask me what my talents are i cant name any i follow current events politics foreign policy i read the washington post and the ny times and the economist i listen to podcasts but to me thats not so much a hobby as just part of being a responsible citizen who keeps up with whats going on in the world i try to go running or ride my stationary bike a few times a week but again i dont see that as a hobby but just doing what were all technically supposed to do to minimize the risk of health problems none of these are things that really bring you closer to people or are conducive to meeting them when i was in college thered always be some guy who was an amazing guitar player and people would just magnetically gravitate toward him and just vibe ive never had any musical talent or people would just play frisbee or pickup soccer ive never been able to do something like that my body freezes up i panic im afraid im going to make a mistake and everyone else will get mad at me in middle school pe if we had to play soccer or basketball id always just stand as far off to the side as i could and run away from the ball if it was anywhere near me if i was getting in trouble for that id say i had to go to the bathroom or wasnt feeling well and needed to see the nurse in hs i ran cross country precisely because so much of the competition wasnt being watched you didnt have to do anything with other people and if you messed up it was solely on you and nobody else would get pissed off at you a lot of people seem to do things like play softball or volleyball in rec leagues and i wish i could do something like that without having a panic attack and feeling like a fucking spaz ive never really played video games when i was growing up my parents basically forbade me from playing any that they regarded as too violent which meant nothing like halo or cod or the other popular franchises people would get into and ive always avoided them as an adult because if i started spending a bunch of time playing video games by myself somehow that would make me feel even more isolated than i already am ive never really done any traveling because ive always felt too selfconscious to take a trip by myself im a guy so i dont have the excuse of safety which can be an issue for women doing solo travel in some parts of the world in college i never did any kind of study abroad because i was afraid id get there and nobody would like me and id basically be trapped there for weeks with no way to escape id feel embarrassed about not being able to speak to people in their native language even though virtually no americans can do that anyway i see people on social media backpacking through europe or asia and hanging out with all these people they just met and i have no fucking clue how they pull that off does anyone else feel this way almost like youre just a nonplayer character in a video game who doesnt really get to have their own story while everyone else is going on adventures through life if i meet someone and they ask what i like to do i basically draw a blank or if not do you have any suggestions for how to make yourself more interesting,3
no friendsaccomplishments etc just been living the past few years in isolation i have a deep sense of shame about this and i finally feel like i want to come out and like be a person again but the thought of meeting new people who didnt waste years in isolation makes me queasy making friends when you have none just feels downright embarrassing reconnecting with people i lost touch with years ago due to this lovely pd is also mortifying sorry i stopped talking to you i took a break from being a person for a few years isnt really something i feel comfortable admitting how do i explain myself without scaring off everyone what if i do engage with the world again have a good thing going for a while and then just shut down again only this time with a new batch of people to disappoint when i inevitably ghost them so i do nothing the cycle continues,3
like i barely can do the most basic things like taking care of myself and if some obstacle gets in the way i wouldnt know what am i suppose to do and im grown ass adult years old dont know how to stop being like this,3
i dont know if this is even a thing but i feel like it describes me i have no problems talking to people especially strangers yet i have no follow through if they show interest ill get invited for dinner coffee etc and always make an excuse i did get married twice but left quickly as soon as things became difficult and while i was in them i was very much a loner i had no desire to go out with friends do things with family and such i start projects with earnest and get so excited about them yet cant follow through to finish them even on reddit i have no problem starting a conversation yet when someone replies it puts me in flight mode im so afraid ill be seen as dumb or unlearned or that my opinion isnt worthy of a response i have the get up and go that got up and went i guess you could say im trying to work past it though and not just react in the moment anymore and instead take my time and push myself to follow through i dont want this disorder to control me like it does can you relate,3
frustratingly it takes time for me to get back out i keep thinking how dumb it was for me to even bother trying when i shouldve stayed quiet like usual its annoying because when it comes to social situations i pretty much never forget things so i can end up dwelling on things a lot,3
ive been hearing a lot about rejection therapy and it sounds like a great idea for people in general to do but especially for those of us with avpd the thing is the thought of me trying it makes me nauseous like id rather die than torture myself like that im wondering if anyone in this sub has tried it out and how did it go did it help,3
i just found this group recently and it got me thinking i feel like i was always this way but it doesnt make sense to me that someone would simply be born this way one of my first memories was standing behind my parents and somebody asked them what is wrong with him to which they responded oh he is just shy in the first grade during story time i would face against the wall feet away from everybody and just daydream never joining in but according to my mom my teacher found it cute so she never said anything i found it embarrassing at the age of when someone would call their parents mommy and daddy i would sit with the kids that bullied me during lunchtime because i desperately wanted them to accept me up until high school i would constantly go to the nurses office trying to act sick so i could leave and at the very least be able to laydown for sometime from middleschool to highschool i found my way to kinda fit in which was through humor gained a lot of attention but i only felt like i had real friends this entire time even though id spend countless nights crying thinking those friends really hated me any girl i liked in highschool i would never pursue because i didnt think i deserved them im sure everyone here did this though since the focus is on childhood im going to stop here but i just find it interesting how for me it seems i was always like this how is it that in early development someone can be so selfconscious,3
i am currently in my second semester in college and i hate it i am not the most intelligent person but i try my best its expensive but my scholarships cover it so i am going for free i am very grateful that i have this opportunity but it is terrible i started with a mandatory orientation where all we did was walk around and talk to each other this was my personal circle of hell i can manage in small groups but this was at least people a week of that ampxb i also had a class called you at school it was all team building it was a showup for credit class and i almost failed because i wouldnt participate i had to do a presentation and just started crying in the middle of it i have never been more embarrassed in my life i went to sit down and the girl next to me was patting my shoulder and asking if i wanted to go into the hallway for a bit i dont like people touching me ampxb now as a recovering addict i have another layer of isolation everyone is in their my mom is not here lets party phase and i cant be around any type of substance without jeopardizing my sobriety so i cant just show up to an open party or talk because thats all people do now ampxb i also have a class thats just discussion groups it is people so not as bad as my larger class except no one talks its just the ta repeating the same question prompt over and over till someone speaks up i wanted to fill the awkward silence so i said something and now i am expected to talk all the time ampxb i hate talking i wish i had an invisibility cloak to go to class with i am ruining my education because i cant function properly and i am so jealous of others around me i want to be happy like them,3
im and havent had any proper friends for like years i know lots of people are in this situation but i feel like its extra hard for me because i am such a sociable person at heart and talking to others is the main ways i naturally feel happy im not confident but i have forced myself to go out and meet people but i think my personality is too weird that ill never really get close to anyone it takes so much energy to push myself and open up to strangers and be my socially awkward embarrassing self in front of people so when i manage to do it and dont make friends it makes me want to give up at life i think about this all the time and never get any relief from constant feelings of loneliness and boredom and emptiness and when im around people like working and realise im not close to anyone it i have to literally use breathing exercises to stop myself from crying because i realise that im a huge mis fit and the odds of me making a friend with my avpd and everything are extremely slim and i shouldnt have as much hope as i do i dont know what to do anymore its been a long time and im just waiting for something that isnt in my future and i want to give up i dont know how to keep going or what for,3
ive found myself in more groups in school this semester and its really starting to affect me since i have to talk to my classmates its hard not to become acquaintances with some of them but now i feel like im in too deep and need to retreat i want to shut everyone out to protect myself i know its stupid because they arent mean to me or make me feel bad its just in my head my mind tells me that they dont really care for methey just have to talk to me what is that why cant i just believe that people can like me as a person constantly having to battle my negative thoughts about myself to keep from shutting down on everyone this is so dumband i feel really self centered for thinking this way,3
not sure if anyone else relates but im struggling to start or finish anything im incredibly behind in my work and i dont do any hobbies or spend much time at the gym either im also pretty ashamed of myself which leads me to avoid people its not a good circle to be stuck in ive had ideas for things to try but its pretty hard to start anything does anyone else relate,3
i have no problem with being open and honest with my therapist but no matter what i say i never feel like anything i ever say is true i can talk about how sad i feel or what it feels like to have a conversation but somehow my brain always wants me to think that im making stuff up or something i have so many conversations in my head where i feel like im able to express myself fully but once im talking to my therapist or anyone else for that matter its all just nonsense it just makes me feel so god damn lonely and stupid so i told my therapist about this and she suggested i make a recording or write whatever i want to say down so that i can express myself more fully anyone else have the same problem,3
yall have got to share them,3
i mean people have always been superficial but i feel like tiktok has made this problem much worse ive had my hair cut short for years now and in those years ive been treated like shit gradually getting worse since the pandemic i used to be so happy with myself and short hair as a women but i now feel like people are stripping me of that i constantly get irritating comments like when are you going to grow it out you should grow it out i miss your long hair i bet your hair is beautiful long are you in army this one particularly bothers me because thats not the sort of way i want to present myself i am very anti military antiwar and to be seen as a supporter of that just irks me poor you must have cancer im sorry get well soon are you making a statement grow out your hair youll look better you look like a dyke your hair makes you look antisocial and probably more im forgetting another thing is that ive been rejected by men before from just my hair it hurts so fucking much it makes me never want to show my face in public again im already so ashamed of how i look i feel like im disgusting and stupid looking im sick of hearing comments and being treated like this so i decided to just give in and let it grow out i give up,3
my father is an addict and overall an incomprehensible and insufferable person he never gave me nothing he has never been willing to listen to me and when i insist on expressing my ideas he calls me punk alienated or callow he never gave me a useful advice hes extremely obsessive and unflexible his neuroticism hits the skies he talks with imaginary people hes unable to follow the most basic social conventions to the point of harrasment in very grotesque ways he believes that most people including me my mom and my brother are zombies dominated by the virtual world and the hegemonic imperial power that displays an upside down world sic we live in venezuela he believes or used to believe that he was secretely the number two of the regime that maduro qouted his tweets and that the intelligence service escorted him he believes that his neighbour who has been repeatedly harrased by him owns the biggest child prostitution ring in the country despite coming from a consolidated upper class white family and having opportunities in places like san diego he never worked he never provided my mom who comes from a family of peasants has provided everything in my life by nothing but her own hands when my grandmother died due to my fathers negligence he inherited a ridiculous ammount of money by selling our house he wasted it all in obvious scams in exchange for literal bottles of rum and whiskey at one point i felt anxious about the prospect of him not providing a home for me and him he has always been a parasite when he could he consumed alcohol in copious ammounts and acted very aggresively and disturbingly he made me cry sometimes he brought my mom to the brink of madness his surroundings always smell like tobacco and piss now he totally depends on my mom for survival hes a eternal thing in my life,3
it wasnt that my parents werent married but relatively my dad just wasnt there for me it hurts but i will heal i will deal with my anxiety i will keep working on myself,3
so ive posted here before but here we go again i work on hobbies skills and side hustles very intensely but never intensely enough to do anything with them i have a degree in music education so im really really good at researching and breaking things down to the fundamental level in which i can learn them effectively i am capable of picking things up very quickly its almost like the huge dramatic improvements you make at the beginning of a skill or hobby give me the validation that i crave the problem comes when i hit a plateau in improvement these plateaus where you stop making huge dramatic improvements happen naturally due to my super sick avpd tendencies this plateau is perceived as invalidation and rejection im aware of how ridiculous it is but it continues to happen at this point i basically ghost the hobby and start with something old or new whether or not i retain the knowledge from my fixation is anyones guess what should happen at these points of plateau is thoughtful consistency if you continue to chip away those vast improvements will happen but over a larger timespan i am unable to achieve that consistency because my avpd tendencies make it extremely difficult to get past the first plateau of any skill ideally i wish i could just spend months and months even years fixating on doing just one thing so that i can actually see these trees bear fruit here are a few examples of what i mean contemporaryjazz saxophonebass have the skillsknowledge in order to play and make a nice amount of cash gigging or playing weddings cant use these skills because i lack the consistency to go to jam sessions monthly network and learn the songs necessary to operate in these settings the intense social aspect of the jazzcontemporary music scene also triggers my avpd tendencies youtubevideo editingcontent creation built a youtube channel totally unrelated to music from nothing to monetized in less than a year with almost views lots of potential for growth i taught myself and know my away around photoshop premiere pro after effects with knowledge of basic filmmakingediting techniques audio engineering etc again i wish i could just completely no life this and make it blow up cause i know i could programmingtech ive taught myself in a short time frame a lot about programming as well as the industry best practices and standards i know for a fact that if i could just do this every day consistently i could turn it in to a career i wish i could just pick one of these things and go hard at it every single day,3
after isolating for so many years i dont know how to act around people i dont feel human people dont like me as soon as they meet me and i cant figure out what im doing wrong anymore,3
sorry for my bad english but ive been bottling up for too long and i dont know what to do no one can understand me even my parents and therapists and strangers on the internet last year in february i quit college online cuz i cant handle it even though i got a good grade in one of my courses but i didnt think i got it at all and after that i wanted to start the business but i dont have money my mom gave me money but she just gave me she said after the items sold out i will give u money again but when i started to sell in my shop it didnt succeed cuz maybe i just have little items also when i was in college my mom rarely gave me money unless it was for college tuition and the money for internet my father is still alive but he never paid for my school but the hurt thing in my life was my stepbrothers think that my father never gave them money cuz they think that all of my fathers money was used up for me and now i am yo i sent many job applications about or more but just get accepted for job but i ignore it cuz i cant ride a motorcycle and i think the salary was too low i was thinking that i want to go to another country for a job so i can get better life cuz i have a chronic illness and mental illness but i dont have money i told my mom about that but she didnt agree with me she want me to just stay here i rarely lied to my parents when i was asking for money but now sometimes i am lying to them cuz i think they are too stingy for just the only child in this family i wanted to try short courses to get a remote job but i am unmotivated people on the internet was saying that i have a sexy body when i sent my pics to them i was thinking that maybe i can get a job in onlyfans but i was too shy about that ive never doin voice calling and video calling when i was doin sexting btw i am still a virgin but sometimes i want to try to lose it but now there is no way to lose it cuz i have no life and my life is messed up,3
recognize the problem folks take control of it as best as you can,3
and i dont know what to do i have some little money and currently have a remote job but i maybe will loose it soon maybe next month theyre not firing me just due to circumstances they may or may not close the studio its not clear yet probably i can rent for a few months but everything is so overpriced so im not sure and its middle of winter so anxious right now i tried to look for a job online but didnt find anything theres nothing irl cause i live in small shithole town and i probably wont be hired that way anyway but i didnt actually try hardly to find anything just sitting on my ass procrastinating dont even have any friends or even acquaintances so,3
i feel like when someone such as my boyfriend or family are upset that it is my fault i feel like i try my hardest to be perfect yet i am constantly falling way shorter than everyone else and what is expected of me i feel like i am an annoyance waste fup and dumb i am fairly observant of peoples body language and tone of voice i pick up on a lot but some times i wonder if im making everything about me and i just need to ignore my hurt feelings im not sure how to navigate these situations,3
cant stop ruminating on failed friendshipcrush i havent seen or talked to them in years but i just cant let it go completely,3
i just want to know for those that finish university how do you do it i drop out last year because of how insanely hard and painfull it was and i was also getting kinda bullied,3
ok this is gonna be really weird and random but i just wanted to share this becauseidk feels like something meaningful to me i guess thinking about all sorts of things takes like of my day my brain never shuts and when i think about big picture like the world outside my internal one and my struggles i am getting upset and resentful over my life my one true friend during those times is my imagination and fantasies about life where i am normal and justwell happy about a month ago i finished watching playthrough of lost in vivo and this is where the weird part starts lol in short its game where player comes through vivo exposure therapy to overcome their fears and anxiety in the good ending player succeed and it represented as coming through light in the tunnel and reuniting with your dog and that final scene it has such a calming music atmosphere the players been to hell and back so this light in the tunnel ending is really awesome so when i finished it i started to imagine myself as that player ive been through such a lot of things and i am trying my best to manage so it gives me that tiny spark of hope that after all universe will give me a break maybe thingsll get better and maybe just maybe i could finally make baby steps towards my dreams without my avpd being triggered so much thanks for listening to me,3
im curious bcuz i sorta do and i post even tho i feel shit ab my appearance its a confusing relationship lol,3
i know this question sounds resentful and judgmental it sounds like an accusation almost but im tired of getting hurt because i overestimate how important i am to the other person even if they said no youre not important to me it would hurt as hell but only at first like ripping the bandaid off i would learn to not get attached and wed talk at a respectable distance does someone know the way to word this question better im so done with this constant confusion,3

when i meet someone new it seems like im always the person being curious and asking them questions it just dawned on me they rarely ever ask me anything besides my name if that its honestly tiresome,3
like even in discord servers for lonely people and foreveralone people or other groups everyone is still more talkative and text a lot and dm each other in those places i dont dm anyone ever and rarely does anyone feel like dming me its like something is wrong with me i feel disconnected from people but idk how to establish a connection i dont even have the motivation to try to do it anymore but it makes me sad when even other socially malfunctioning people thrive in niche communities and i cant its like i suck everywhere i go and im always an outcast meanwhile others are still capable of forming bonds its an awful feeling,3
anyone else have a hard time crying its like i have to push out a poop lol even when alonecrying in front of ppl dont feel like an option cant even cry properly smh,3
does anyone else know this feeling i dont speak to anyone most days just my mom and dad sometimes my sister when i do speak my voice sounds all weird because of the lack of practice its kinda funny because ive noticed that despite being fluent in english its my second language but ive studied it since i was a kid sometimes i forget how to speak it properly sometimes i say things that dont make grammatical sense or i dont pronounce words correctly idk why this is happening maybe because i rarely speak with other people that arent my parents no one ever notices me in school it doesnt matter if i sit on the back or all the way on the front no one ever talks to me and i dont talk to anyone i havent had a meaningful relationship of any kind with anyone in literal years the last friend i ever had was when i was im now i spent all high school sitting by myself behind a tree even now in college im by myself i rarely leave my house its so fucking pathetic but i just cant make friends i dont relate to anyone i dont feel comfortable around anyone i feel like im acting whenever i interact with someone like its not real i dont feel like a real person,3
edit im not native i directly translated affronter but i guess face the world is more common to use made me realize how little i know about anything once you start to avoid its a never ending cycle you seek to forget the real wolrd and once you try to avoid the avoidance you understand how much youre behind to the point where it seems impossible to catch up i have dropped highschool a few years ago never studied more got a diploma or worked dont really have any friend never had a partner i get too anxious with anything social even multiplayer games in the past years i have left my house like twenty times im driven by avpd and have very poor hygiene due to selfneglect and depression im not skilled in anything not particularly intelligent either definitely not physically gifted and absolutely hideous try to get a normal life with that background lol i feel worthless i have so much shame against myself it sounds so hard for the first time i want to find a way out and not rot in my room for the first time i have ambitions its so hard its like living was not made for me i think i was a mistake not supposed to live this far or at all ill keep trying though wish me luck,3
ive been noticing my symptoms increasing its getting to the point i cant hold conversations with anyone but my wife without becoming suicidal its been getting worse each week is this normal feburary is usually the hardest month of the year for me so that might be a factor but god is it going to continue like this forever,3
my mom basically tells me its my fault i feel alone because i reject all of her offers to socialize which im not denyingit is my fault lol when i tell her i want to make new connections with strangers she tells me that makes no sense and why dont i hang with family she doesnt get it when i say family scares me more than strangers with strangers theres much less at stake they dont know shit about you you dont know shit about them and if something goes wrong you never have to speak to them again its one and done she also didnt understand why i wanted to work retail i dont anymore for different reasons now she asked me how can i talk to strangers yet im too scared to talk to family she doesnt understand that i just do better in work or education based settings you dont have to get into your personal life that much and once the day is over you go home and dont have to talk to them theres not much expectations because theyre your classmatescoworkers you dont have to let them know too much about you my mom just doesnt get it and i hate talking to her about anything at all because she gives me over simplistic solutions and lowkey makes me feel bad for having these issues when shes part of the reason why i have it in the first place as an adult its my responsibility to fix this but i know what my threshold is im tired of her acting like she knows me better than i know myself and she told me she knows me better than i know myself,3

heya first of all sorry for any ramblings or incorrect sentences my brain is all fuzzy and im shaking sadly ive just sent off an email for a volunteering work its a simple museum carer i will take care of the gardens the tourists and whatever needs available i needed to do this to boost up my cv because i cant work because sadlyavpd and cptsd its all flexible hours i wont get into any trouble if i miss a few days or whatnot but i am still so fucking scared this isnt anything o new situation fear no ive been to the museum once or twice and know the people i know the community but i am so damn fucking scared of rejection i am scared of the possible outcomes this will bring me i am scared of the social aspects of it i keep getting these thoughts of theyll think im a creep ill probably never keep up with it because i am a pathetic good for nothing lower to everyone else its hurting me and i need advice on how to just keep going what should i do once it starts fight through the thoughts and fears it was already hard enough as it was to do the paper now im crashing wondering what the fuck was i thinking but im trying to keep positive as much as i possibly can this could be a mix of social anxiety and avpd running its course but i dont know all i know is that i am scared and very fearful of the future of people of being seeing in public of messing up big time any words of encouragement or advice will help a lot thank you,3
i suffer from a severe form of avpd and after many years since i wanted this last year with the help of my exgirlfriend i succeeded to go to a psychologist and to the gym its was very difficult but now i have months when i am in therapy and months when i go to gym i know for normal people this a something normal but for me was very difficult now im trying to get a driver license but i think will be very difficult because my sever anxiety,3

i have found myself asking this alot recently over the last couple weeks ive been invited out a bunch by friends and friends of friends i went to a few of them but am still ultimately confused on being included in so many plans because i often feel like im not that interesting of a person not that i dont enjoy being included i do but at a certain point i felt overloaded just wondering if anyone else has this phenomenon or if maybe im something else in addition to being avpd view pollhttpswwwredditcompolldxr,3
my teacher already told me that its impossible for me to continue the next semester i already know that but she told me it needs to come from the principal itself for confirmation so we went to him just for the confirmation now the principal went on and on about me coming to him begging for a second chance which i didnt i just went there for a confirmation i already know theyre not gonna give me a second chance i didnt come there to beg he then went on about how i dont really have anxiety because if i do have anxiety i would have found a way apparently he knows because he has anxiety too the thing is i dont have anxiety avoidant personality disorder is different from anxiety he then said im just making excuses and i just got lazy im not asking them for second chances i know right from the start they are not gonna accept me anymore but i dont appreciate them making fun of my shitty mental health thats the thing with this disorder we literally avoid things to the point where it affects our whole life he was acting like i went to his office crying and kneeling down begging to give me a second chance he said i know why you came here to ask for a second chance when i literally just sat in front on his desk and agreed that they cant give me another chance i wouldnt have come if i knew he was gonna make fun of my disorder i only came because my teacher said it needed to come from him for it to be final now everyone thinks im just making shit up it also doesnt help that my country doesnt have a ged i wonder what their faces would look like if i killed myself wouldnt it be funny they make fun of my mental illness and then the next day they get the news that i killed myself,3
httpswwwidrlabscomvillaintestphphttpswwwidrlabscomvillaintestphp im curious how the other side of the coin looks in us,3
ive struggled with mentalemotional problems pretty much all my life even as a young kid i was very shy and anxious that morphed into more severe problems as i became a teenyoung adult now at almost im really frustrated because nothing gets better for me doctors keep trying to treat me for depression or anxiety or adhd which i do have problems with but it seems like there are more fundamental deeply set issues which go unaddressed ive been interested in psychology since i was a teen and there have been times where ive considered that i might have avpd before forgetting about it but recently i began researching this in earnest and pretty much every diagnostic criterion strongly fits me its kind of scary how well it describes me and how much the posts in this sub reflect my thoughts amp experiences where should i go from here how can i bring this up with my psych or should i bring it up would getting a diagnosis be worth it,3
f just a disclaimer i havent been formally diagnosed yet but i relate to avpd in so many ways that i cant dive into right now i relate way more to avpd than social anxiety but of course idk for sure but anyway i was wondering if people with just avpd experience something like splitting that occurs in bpd after feeling like someones rejected them or criticised them for example i was having a job interview and the people interviewing me seemed really nice and i really really liked them but as the interview went on i felt like their body language and tone of voice showed they were criticising and judging me after i felt that its like a switch flicked and i hated them absolutely hated them i was so mad internally and all i could think of was how mean they were even tho they literally didnt do anything i was so angry and i just wanted to break down and cry because i also hated myself too for embarrassing myself and looking weird and ruining my chance to get hired anyway i got the job and i love them again and cant even imagine ever hating them this sort of thing happens to me all the time with almost everyone in my life and its so confusing except i thought it was only a bpd thing or could it be a mix of both or complex ptsd does anyone else experience this often too also im seeing a therapist and psychiatrist really soon and im not self diagnosing,3
so ive had this for a long time but only now have i sort of grasped why i feel like this whenever im outside and especially in closed off public transport like the subway ill feel like a creep because i just stare and analyze everyone and everything the reality is that when i get anxious i get hyperaware of everything and everyone around me and when i start starting at strangers analyzing every bit of their appearanceclothingpostureetc i start feeling like a creep only recently have i realized that the being hyperaware is where the feeling of being a creep comes from vs just organically with me being less anxious lately im more able to just stare off into the distance and distract myself with my thoughts and then suddenly i dont feel so inadequateweird anymore i know ive thought about this before and even said it to someone that when my anxiety takes over i literally cant think of anything but the present situation ill literally start brainstorming ideas to think about so i can distract myself from whats in my face that second just felt like typing this out and sharing maybe someone can relate much love,3
i manage to mess up over and over always making people not like me very much at least thats how it feels im a very flawed person tbh and not sure if i would have been this way if it wasnt for trauma mental illness but who knows it just scares me that every time i open my mouth i risk saying something wrong and being hated i dont know how to be correct or say the right things and be liked im just wrong and have bad takes and am just stupid and dont know what im talking about and i should just shut up,3
i have a therapy session today and it basically determines my entire future im and currently studying and my school is basically just for people in therapy i couldnt imagine going to a normal school at this point my therapist pretty much told me shed stop seeing me if i didnt show any improvement and i told her that my life would be over if that happened i wasnt trying to be dramatic its just true not only would i be kicked out but i also wouldnt have a school to go to as i cant function in a regular school setting i know very well that i havent shown any improvement since the last time we spoke and idk what to tell her when she asks me about it ive considered lying but im pretty shit a it shes quite terrible but its so difficult to switch therapists here that idk what to do,3
not you guys but everyone on the internet what is wrong with people grieving publicly about things they have nothing to do with why are we encouraging and cheering on when someone posts in minute detail about how someone died why are they doing that in the first place its your loved one what businesses does anyone else have with them and ten minutes ago i found a picture on a subreddit someone posted of their ex boyfriend in the hospital my heart wrenched why would you do that to them wh is there something wrong with me,3
i wonder if thats the way we should be,3
im diagnosed with avpd and bpd and my boyfriend broke up with me a few days ago im and up until about months ago i was convinced i was completely unlovable i didnt come from such a great home and i was bullied for all of elementary school all ive been told for all my life is that i am worthless ugly disgusting and just a horrible person but then i met a guy that made me feel loved like i deserved to be loved for the first time in my life we dated for months then he broke up with me because i have a personality disorder i never told him im diagnosed with avpd and bpd because even though he told me he would always love me i was afraid that if he knew about my disorders hed break up with me turns out i was right because i finally decided to tell him about a week ago days later he texted me and basically said that he wants to end this he said he didnt want to be together with someone with borderline i asked if i did something wrong but he said he just didnt want the drama i know i didnt do anything wrong i never did anything to hurt him but just because ive been through shit he doesnt want to love me the rational part of me knows hes being an asshole but the bpdavpd part of me wants me to think that im the asshole was he right not to love me am i really that horrible i dont know what to do i feel completely worthless no one will ever love me and i shouldnt ever leave my house again i deserve this i dont want to do this anymore,3

tw rape sexual assault im and an exfriend of mine is three years ago i cut off our friendship it was the closest relationship ive ever had and ive never felt more connected to a person since i think about him everyday years ago my sister who well call s accused him of raping her but she didnt even i had to confront her about it according to my exfriend who well call f they got really really drunk one night and ended up having sex one week or so after it happened f told me first he said that s thought it was his imagination until he saw s had blocked him on every social media and he wasnt sure what happened he thinks maybe shes guilty because s had a boyfriend at the time he tells me to ask her what happened i say maybe she thinks it was nonconsensual since you were both inebriated he says thats possible he tells me she was asleep he was in bed with her drinking and getting high she had invited him into bed with hershe told me she felt he was a little brother and could trust him he was drinking all night as she slept when she woke up they were both black out drunk he doesnt remember who kissed who first but that she initiated grinding and that something happened after that it makes me sick thinking about it after that night he tells me my mother messaged him saying never step foot into this house again but op needs you as a friend so lets just promise to keep this between us he wasnt sure what that meant but was afraid of the worst context matters s was years old f was shes a decently heavy drinker by no means an alcoholic but she can hold her liquor hes literally autistic does it sound like an imbalance maybe more context matters the people who checked in on them noticed that he was decently lucid last time they were seen together while she was asleep high and drunk passed out blacked out he claims he was in the process of getting drunk as she slept even more context my family has a shaky moral foundation they lie to get money to get their way theyve made me do it even if i didnt want to they dont care about anyone else except the family but theyll even mess with family if it comes to it my sister and mom planned to keep it from me like i said my mom thought i needed f so much that she was willing to keep it a family secret and i keep thinking if f was a monster if f had such shaky grounds if f cared about power he would have played along with it i know that monsters dont rape people rape but people also look out for themselves when they know theyve fucked up people are selfish f didnt seem selfish to me a selfaware rapist would have kept his mouth shut right why didnt he accept my mothers conditions and kept the family secret he told me my friendship with him was his greatest source of happiness he wouldve done anything to preserve it why didnt he and my family knew this friend meant so much to me that they were willing to keep my sisters rape a secret for my sake if f was a monster he would have taken the deal but monsters dont rape people do f told me everything he agreed that i should talk to s and get her side of the story because he wasnt sure if he had raped her either he didnt know or was his game to play dumb s told me that she only remembers flashes he raped me she said after i asked she starts crying she says she woke up with bruised wrists she woke up sore she didnt look like she was lying i dont think she was lying and for three years ive been haunted by the idea what if truly he didnt think he had raped her not in the way idiot monstrous men believe that drunk women can consent me and f took consent extremely seriously but what if truly they were both extremely drunk and they lost control of their both their bodies and that nothing could have possibly made sense except for an ugly truth if there were a reality where my friend was truly too drunk to rape someone and too drunk to give consent himself but somehow ended up having sex with someone equally too drunk to not give consent then what would that reality look like because everyday i wake up and think that reality looks frighteningly close to this one,3

im pretty much completely alone my family is mostly dead and the rest no contact im f divorced no kids and i just ended a three year post marriage relationship that was pretty toxic i have two best friends since high school weve known each other over years and we used to be inseparable we all had family issues so we became our own family they both moved out of state at least years ago so the majority of our friendship is on the phone and we maybe visit each other once or twice a year my last relationship which lasted three years really got in the way of our friendships my boyfriend was so clingy i could never call my friends because he wouldnt leave me alone for a minute thats a whole other unhealthy issue i cant get into lol but as an avoidant person it drove me crazy anytime i had the chance to be alone without my boyfriend the last thing i wanted to do was call my friends i needed alone time i did try to break up with him several times he even moved out a few times but kept coming back i finally broke up with him for good about six months ago anyway i understand why they are reluctant to just go back to the way things were in our friendship i dont blame them for being upset with me and i fully plan to try my best to make it up to them and im grateful that they are willing to talk to me at all but im not sure i like them anymore weve been friends for so long i seriously dont have anyone else in my life and i am afraid i am just doing the avoidant thing and looking for reasons to write them out of my life ive done that with everyone else in my life but these two always seemed special and i feel like weve known each other so long they are family and i want to always know them but they arent really being good friends anymore i know people grow apart and i admit that i am the one who stopped talking as much initially and like i said i was and am more than prepared to make up to them the fact that i havent been around but honestly i wasnt around because i was in a toxic relationship and i told them that every time i did get a chance to talk to them i talked about how i was stuck for financial reasons and covid and that i was losing my mind to never be alone and they didnt help me they didnt encourage me to get out or give me advice they just got more and more distant and now that i am broken up they tell me this guy was bad for me but they wouldnt tell me that when we were together and thats what i needed to hear from them instead they just acted like they liked my bf and talked bad about both of us to each other i hate to say but it almost feels like they were enjoying me being in a bad relationship maybe im just paranoid they say they forgive me but they dont talk to me very much one really doesnt call me or answer me and the other calls all the time but im not allowed to talk about my relationship at all he has hung up on me twice for even mentioning it i get that he doesnt like my ex but neither do i and i was in a toxic relationship for three years i need to talk some of it through i would never do that to them and god knows i have had to listen to some boring andor stupid problems of theirs repeatedly over the years why cant they do that for me i know people out grow each other they have made new friends and i need to as well but its hard for me because well i have avpd ideally i would like to keep them as friends and make new friends that understand more about the person i am now instead of the person i was in high school but the part of me that pushes people away wants to push them out and i dont know what to do do they get to treat me bad because i wasnt as accessible to them for a while i was never completely gone i just couldnt be there as much do they get points for being friends with me so long should i just over look it or am i right that they are being disrespectful by telling me what i can or cant talk about hanging up on me if i mention something they dont like talking to each other and excluding me even if they are talking about coming into town and staying with me even when they are not invited i have to work and they are on vacation but please come stay at my house and expect me to drop everything to do what you want we never do what i want when they come to visit because i live here so i have to be on board to do everything they want to do i know its a long story there is a lot more to it too but am i blowing things out of proportion and prematurely ending my longest and only friendships or has the time apart from them given me clarity to see who they really are which is bossy and disrespectful of me and i should just try and make new friends that dont judge me so harshly like talking and listening to me and actually live in my town tldr i have had a hard life and i want to stand up for myself but its leaving me completely alone am i cutting out my friends too quickly,3
have any of you become hikikomori because of the condition of avoiding personality disorder i personally do and im tired of being a hikikomori,3
im sure youve seen those doors with the warning signs that say its not meant for customers at establishments socializing with avpd feels im walking into one of those employee only areas that same sense of urgency knowing that i dont belong there and i need to get out before something bad happens,3
ive struggled to find any kind of media where the protagonist specifically struggles with avoidance i really enjoyed amelie and resonated a lot with the character but feel that she could more easily be seen as struggling with asd or even just extreme shyness introversion i dont know about anyone else but seeing characters i identify with in films or in novels brings me a lot of comfort it kind of brings awareness to those traits and humanises people and has the ability to shift the audiences perspective on those issues maybe if we had more coverage in the mainstream we wouldnt feel as defective or alien id love seeing an avoidant main character and having people really understand how severe this disorder can be and how overlooked it is it could be painful and raw showing how damaging isolation can be yet how there appears to be no alternative but it could also have light moments and laughoutloud moments and show how people suffering with this disorder have light inside them despite everything i also think its important that the character be shown to be relatively attractive intelligent good work ethic etc i think a large part and maybe the most tragic of this pd is that we view ourselves as less than we are almost like we have conditioned ourselves to not value anything about us even if that value is present i think people should see how the issue is deep rooted and its not as simple as improving things like wealth appearance or even social skills im curious what other people think would be important to include in a film centred on a character with avpd also this song would definitely make an appearance imo httpsyoutubewdlazfqlbs,3

ive been in an episode of complete isolation for about yrs but doing my best to claw myself out with a therapists encouragement i reached out to the person i love more than anything who ive been in love with for years and she full of grace and compassion accepted me back but she is in a relationship now i told myself that this was likely and that i would be okay with it but i dont think i am i feel sick to my stomach and havent stopped crying how can i be a good friend when its so painful to talk to her when all the advice says that to get over unrequited love you should distance yourself when thats exactly what im trying not to do i cant hurt her again by distancing myself without explaining why but i cant tell her how i feel because that would be disrespectful of her relationship ive completely ruined everything i deserve the pain im feeling but i still cant cope with it it sounds like its new if id been able to reach out even a few months earlier i might have been able to tell her now i feel like ive lost my one and only chance to be happy im so selfish and stupid i dont know what to do i hate myself so much,3
leaving the house is so difficult because no matter where i am i can feel like every single person is staring at me and making fun of me or judging me when i walk outside i can feel the stares from everyone in their cars when im on a bus i can feel the eyes of every single person on the bus even when i just get out of my house i feel like the whole neighbourhood is staring at me i know ive been experiencing this for a long time definitely since i was a teenager i grew my hair out so that it can cover a lot of my face because i felt like people were doing that my first memory of having anxiety i was and i was late to school and was too afraid to walk in the class because everyone would look at me it took me mins just to walk in and then because of that my teacher yelled at me in front of the class i would feel sick before presentations in elementary school and didnt know why any kind of attention on me scares the living shit out of me i dont know if this is avpd or not but it causes me so much distress it doesnt help that i didnt leave my house for many years and was agoraphobic,3
i dont normally get sad around valentines because i never really expected to have a relationship but i guess because of getting some help from my therapist my emotions around not dating etc have been stirred up sick of how normal it is for other people to date when its so hard for me anyways just wanted to say even if its a bad day for you happy early valentines day,3
if they miss work if theyre late to an event if someone or other is upset with them some people dont let that shit get them down but for me it turns into a selfhating spiral of why i cant function do you relate to holding onto and beating yourself up for small personal failures while im here i have one other question i notice my emotions and my reaction to my emotions is extremely dependent on my immediate environment that is to say i dont take discomfort well at all i dont cope with thoughts like it will be over soon next time wont be so bad because i cant get myself out of the suffering of the here and now for my life this makes working hard which makes money hard which lends itself to the spiral of worthlessness i abuse dissociative drugs for this reason its the only possible way to escape the reality of the present which is often uncomfortable the dxm actually not only pulls me away but allows me to see things objectively and see the beauty and humor in life how small i am and how big everything else is things like that i dont mean to derail i know its not a drug sub but so do you find your emotions to be a direct reaction of the environment around you so much so that you cant avoid them and spend much of your life actively suffering like me sorry if this post is stupid and if you do,3

edit youve made your point,3
i think i like my life when i am alone i am happy to be by myself do my work and my chores and i have hobbies that bring me joy but it feels as if it all comes crashing down and a heavy sense of depression and grief hangs over me as soon as im reminded that other people do fun things together i dont want to join them because most of the time having fun with friends isnt actually fun for me but the feeling persists and can go on for days i know its silly to feel resentful of these other people and it makes me resentful towards myself as well i just want to make it stop ex driving my sister who is still in high school to hang out with her friends or go on dates im only a year older than her and afterwards suddenly my existence is in a different focus and i remember that objectively it is very dreary that the most exciting thing i have done in a month is watching my spinach sprouts grow,3
hi ill start by saying ive been diagnosed with avpd about years ago around the end of my military service but its something ive dealt with most of my teen life unknowingly and now as a years old still im seeing a therapist for the better part of years now and it helps mainly mentally not physically yet as im not doing much spending all my days at home no friends no social life no nothing i did get a job last week which im starting next week hours a day cleaning some school buildings minutes from my house but as the time goes i find myself daydreaming more and more about stuff id like to do like traveling the world and studying i even got as far as signing up to university but ended up canceling it like days before the semester started since then im daydreaming about traveling going to south america or something last week i said screw it and booked a ticket to barcelona for a trip with my mom and sister i was very excited as im a big fc barcelona fan for years but as we all know something has to go wrong were supposed to fly tomorrow and man this has been one of the worst days i had in the last couple of years i feel like i just wanna disappear until friday arrives when the trip is over i feel like its a task someone is commanding me to finish and not something i ever wanted to do it took me some time cause i usually keep to myself but shared it with my mom and sister and now theyre thinking whether they should cancel or go and theyre waiting for my desicion i also cried talking to my mom and told her many things that she didnt know like how i dont talk to my friends anymore or how before i got this poor job i was sending cvs and when people would call me i couldnt pick up the phone i told her that i feel lonely even when im with them my family cause while they do make me feel good they cant cover up for my nonexistent social life seriously i feel like a mess i roam around feeling down like ive never felt before i think just want to vent a little,3
this movie is underrated you need to watch it at high speed if you like in order to get what intergenerational psychological trauma does to people httpsenwikipediaorgwikithesonfilm i know it has received poor ratings but i think thats because most people dont get what its about its available on the torrent sphere if youre interested in acquiring this movie in that fashion,3
i really want to go to church so bad i have good memories of singing songs that lifted my spirit and developing friendships with people both humble and gracious but every week i dont go this week if i can make it to the parking lot i am rewarding myself with doughnuts i am sorry if this is annoying but i am struggling so much to do something that is important to me and i have not gone in years,3
i dont think i am afraid of the rejection but about two other things first one is that other guys could mock me for my feelings and use this against me and second is that if she does get to know me better she might loose interest as i am just not really good at this dating thing can you relate to that,3
stumbled over this and thought it would resonate lol,3
hey all im really struggling at the moment and all i can think about is resigning from my role im a social worker who provides therapy to childrenadolescents with complex mental health difficulties ive been working at the organisation for months now and roughly a week ago i changed my workplace location to be closer to home its the same service just a different location oh and im acting in a senior position at the new workplace as part of a six month secondment i thought that starting fresh would make me feel more motivated and confident however im still feeling like an imposter scared and worried about criticism extremely terrified of social interactions too just knowing i have to see clients and speak to them gives me major anxiety im also on antidepressants and beta blockers which help a bit but i still dread the work that i have to do all i keep thinking about is waking up in the morning switching off my mobile phone and driving far away to a relaxing environment like a beach pretending i have no responsibilities or cares in the world i know thats not possible though if i did resign i would make sure never to find a therapy role again as its not something im too keen on and social interactions terrify me should i keep trying to work in spite of the anxiety i experience i think ive given it a fair shot and i cant take it anymore any advice would be greatly appreciated thanks,3
i swear id be having a good day but if i ever feel like someones tone of voice is even slightly harsh it ruins the vibe for the whole day this could be anybody random like the front desk or customer representative they dont necessarily say anything mean but their voice is choppy in response to my effort of trying to be animated and kind i know its not a big deal at all and it might just be in my head nothing personal but my brain is just mean i guess i subconsciously take everything personally and its really starting to harm me well at least i recognized this pattern i wish i could be as cold and distant as i appear on the outside i envy people who are very level headed,3

every time i play a skill based game with my husband he kicks my ass growing up having my parents always telling me im intelligent and making a big deal of it always getting good grades and whatever my ego takes such a huge hit when i lose again and again and again i feel so stupid i ended up asking him if he would walk me through his moves while we play chess so i can have clear examples of how to apply different strategies it was maybe the most ashamedpathetic i have ever felt i feel a bit better now but fuck i just want to be able to have fun with him hes the only reason i want to try getting better,3
i had a guy cut in front of me and another woman at the self checkout line today it made me feel ashamed as if i seemed weak or pathetic or maybe just a woman and thats why he felt entitled to just do that as if he was sure i wouldnt say anything and i didnt because i guess i didnt feel angry enough to care anyone else experience shit like this wondering if youre sending im a doormat vibes because in reality i avoid relationships because im strong enough to know id never want to be walked all over but too guilty to get into relationships that are really about my desires and boundaries if that makes sense i avoid because i know im too scared to own who i am but im unwilling to be with other people and be codependent so im alone stuck needing to figure out having the strength to let myself find the people that genuinely meet my needs the funny thing about this though is that when my time came to checkout i still got out of the self checkout faster than him even though we had the same amount of stuff,3
yesterday i saw a post that a person asked if anyone here had improve on avpd and asked for tips almost nobody answered so ill try again because i really want to know any way to improve any tipadvice is valid medicine meditation books mindsets etc for me what helped a lot was exercise calistenics and running remove toxic people out of my life dont sleep too late caffeine a lil bit take care of my appareance medicine and exposure,3
im going through a horrible situation with my reproductive health until the point of having to get treatment for conceiving and all as my tests are showing i dont have much time left for postponing getting pregnant the thing is that at my recently diagnosed avpd has destroyed me even though i have a career im financially stable and got to organize my life a bit i dont have quality of life im so anxious i cant even function worried about what the neighbors around my apartment might think of me i still leave the house for going to work but sometimes im so freaking exhausted i cannot take care of myself and i cant stop but wonder if becoming a parent would be a good idea for me or if it will be better to forget about it as i seem to be a person who doesnt fit into the scheme of a good parent i used to dreamed about having babies back when i was younger but now i think that would be the most egotistical decision i could ever takespecially for a child that didnt ask to be born or have a trashy parent like me who cannot even go to the supermarket alone,3

ive been on depression and anxiety meds but nothing has helped me stop being so afraid to be judged rejected overly sensitive i self isolate and only go outside for shopping to get a quick bite to eat i made improvements in talking to employees of restaurants or at grocery stores but i still have a fear of interacting with others and im always thinking about the chance of being judged and so keep to myself my psychiatrist did recommend me to get some therapy i just wanted to put this out there and see if it might be a possibility of me having this not asking for any diagnosis though,3
just out of curiosity i wonder what age groups are most prominent on this sub and up i cant help but wonder if this age of technology caused this disorder to become so prominent people seem to have lost the ability or have never learned how to socialize with our faces buried into a phone computer game etc nobody communicates in person like in the past when people were forced to if there was a function you had to show up to find out who was there maybe im wrong but im curious it just feels like technology has sadly created a world of introverts or has contributed to it anyone agree,3
ive decided to finally take action and try and get some kind of diagnosis so im not just relying on my internal monologue or the internet to deal with this thing i tried therapy once in the past with a therapist who came highly recommended and it just didnt go great after one too many whats the worst that could actually happen questions i just really felt like they didnt understand this was before i had the term avpd to explain my question is this how did you go about working with someone who actually understands the problem my guess is im being a bit too inmyhead about this but i just dont want to show up to a therapist like a hypochondriac who plugged their symptoms into webmd and now is sure of their condition but i also get the impression avpd isnt as common as some other personality disorders so i want to find someone who will at least have familiarity with it but nothing shows up when i search for therapists who specialize in it directly are there other umbrella terms that help when finding a therapist should i just focus on a depressionanxiety doc or maybe one who works with other pds like bpd or am i way off base and plenty of therapists will understand and just had a bad match for my first goaround any suggestions or anecdotes for finding the right kind of help are welcome thanks in advance,3
have never been able to figure out if this is from my avpd or something else it causes so much problems for me especially for romantic relationships where i feel completely unworthy of love or affection if i dont meet the criteria i have in my mind everytime i go out and socialize without meeting the criteria in my mind i end up thinking that people probably feel disgusted by having me around,3
i have to find a way to overcome this because its not working i feel like my identity in this world is shy introverted loner when i try to break the mold of both what i and other people view me as i lowkey have an identity crisis i think this is why i keep sabotaging my efforts to change because i feel like avpd and being a sad sack of trauma is my identity and my place in this world,3
i dont know why im writing this im just feel so anxious rn im worrying about everything i dont think any of this ends well for me its not getting better its just getting worse everyday during the day im ok but at night when im alone and have no distractions i feel scared and anxious i realize im alone and ill most likely always be alone i cant be around people when im like this i self isolate even harder when im hurting theres a really bad feeling in my stomach rn i feel so strange i think theres something wrong with me im not good enough in anything im legitimately the worst human being to exist why tf am i still here none of this ends well im just so tired n even when i sleep i wake up tired i wanna escape this but i dont know how i cant do this im not worthy of existing fuckin hell i think about dying most days but i dont want to i really wanna live a happy life with people in it but theres so much i cant control my brain is always trying to fuck me over its life on impossible mode srry for the rant i just dont know where else to dump all this,3

ive been made redundant from my last jobs the last one being extremely traumatic ive had many extremely close friendships end i was abused and bullied my entire childhood by peers and family now i can barely look people in the eye and cant say hello or respond to small talk in work environments because it induces so much anxiety about being hated and misunderstood i avoid textingresponding to messages because people used to say i was annoying and replied too much if were looking at the evidence everything points to me being a fundamentally unlikeable and hated person i used to be fantastic at short bursts of social interactions but smoked cannabis non stop to be able to do so people liked my stoneddrunk persona more than sober me and now that im sober i feel utterly terrified of interacting with anyone i cant even answer the door for food deliveries i need a job to be able to afford medical treatment but i always get stuck at the cover letter aspect because i feel like as soon as people get to know me they start to hate me most of my work experience has been in customer service or sales based roles but i hated every role ive ever done i dedicated my academic years to studying medicine and law but had to drop out of uni to heal some trauma and i havent returned since i dont know what to do i feel so alone and stuck and my rejection sensitivity is through the roof im so ashamed of my failures and obvious shortcomings that it feels impossible to try to sell myself to a job,3

ive been in and out of therapy since i was thats half my life ive seen psychologists psychiatrists social workers and counsellors ive been through cbt dbt goal focused therapy grief therapy ive been on so many medications ive never been allowed myself to become unstable enough to be hospitalized and ive been able to be the bare minimum functional and composed enough to fly under the radar of more intense interventions when it comes to therapy i have a severe problem with trusting my therapists failing to disclose what i really need help with struggling to express my true thoughts worrying excessively about judgement and criticism and leaving therapy after the initial hope of this one will be what helps dies out likely because of aforementioned problems in march i was diagnosed with bpd but for reasons it was march i never got it addressed but now that i have insurance that covers most of the cost of sessions i want to try again im paying some out of my own pocket too and i dont know if its even worth it due to my history with therapy i sent in a general inquiry to a private office close to me and they referred me to a male therapist which terrifies me as ive only had female therapists before and who uses a different approach psychodynamic therapy which is again fucking terrifying i want to ghost and just not do this so badly and im just fighting against myself arranging two emails is exhausting and fucking nervewracking and i dont even know if this is going to go anywhere i dont even know if im asking for advice or just venting but thanks for reading anyway,3
i feel like part of the reason i go out of my way not to make friends or date is because i have to protect them from myself like i put myself in their shoes and think i wouldnt want to be friends with someone like me so i feel like im keeping them from being annoyed at best or abused at worst i know logically that im not abusive but i cant shake this image of myself as an abusive monster this week i hurt someones feelings via miscommunication and it felt like wow i actually am evil and im validated in closing myself off to everyone it is so frustrating i want to not be this way so badly,3
what i find bizarre is that i never seem to easily recall all the positive feedback ive received instead i focus on the negative feedback that occurred way before then as someone pointed out this is a glaring example of avpd many of us never felt emotionally secure as children which led to our insecure attachment styles and avoidant personalities im trying to take radical responsibility in order to address all of my issues now though,3

honestly dont know where to go from here existence is completely wasted on me i have grouporiented activities i want to join yet i just cant do iti cant even risk social rejection or ridicule im currently in thailand on a sixweek trip with my partner and child while that sentence doesnt exactly sound like it puts me in the category of avoidant personality disorder i am one of the most avoidant people on earth i spent three years at university and only ever talked to about four people none of whom i developed friendships with ive spent my entire adult life working remotely alone at home so that i can avoid any work environment that requires socializing even my relationship is pretty lowquality we dont exactly sit down and have lengthy interesting conversations every day but perhaps even worse still there are various grouporiented activities id love to try that would bring value to my life and i cant at all bring myself to do them one example is muay thai i signed up for a class yesterday arrived at the gym and turned back at the entrance this has happened several times and its a consistent theme in my adult life whether the activity is a martial art soccer or a hiking meetup basically i cant show up for my own life and do the activities that i value im not really living and never really have im now years old ffs close to middleaged im almost certain ill be dead before what a waste of a human i am,3
edit wow so apparently screen addiction is tied in closely ive been addicted to any screen i could get my hands on since i was about five in middle school and until right now so for about years ive felt like it gives me comfort and keeps me flowing it never really mattered to me how complex or primitive the device was i was glued to it now im starting to hate it i dont want it to feel comfortable anymore,3
hello i wonder how many people on this subreddit are diagnosed with avpd in my case it started with social anxiety years ago tried a lot of things nothing helped me so i gave up i was on healthcare all that time i still am my untreated social anxiety evolved in all these years into avpd just a question cause when i hear my friends say i have anxiety also but theyre having a normal life its tiring hearing and reading such things it feels like no one understands what it really is having avpd for me it started long time ago after having meningitis now after years looking for answers this is upsetting to hear my doc never told anything about it he was my doc since i was a kid this makes me mad he ignored all these things he knew everything about me but never made the connection with meningitis my mental state when i left the hospitral the traumahe ignored it all im hearing this fromy parents know how traumatized i was my doc blamed me when i was using things trying to handle my anxiety and depression judging me for everything im discovering this all now years later its a shame hes total ignorent not my doc anymore but i wanted to send a e mail to him wanting answerscause discovering this now is making me mad at my doc that knew me for years no one ever made the connection with meningitis it wasnt written in any report when i was reading storys of other peoplei felt guilt thinking but my youth was good im just a crybaby wanting attention finally years later im getting answers way to late if i have knew this decades ago my psychiatrists therapist my life would be maybe different now my new doc and psychiatrist are saying thiswhy didnt anyone knew about this they dont understand maybe times have changed but it makes me made inside,3
i am m and have never experienced anything of the romantic kind not even crushes i lost my teenage years due to isolation which is usually when people get introduced to this stuff ive never even had female friends except some cousins i live in a culture where arranged marriages are the norm im nearing the age when talk about marriage becomes more serious especially for women but i dont see myself ever getting married ill probably kms before it feels like i will miss out on this part of the human experience because im so insecure around women i saw a post that summarised how i feel perfectly gti have trouble talking to women in fact i cant even make eye contact with them especially if i find them even a little attractive im scared theyll think i like them and then theyll hate that someone as disgusting as me could like them i know that going into a relationship wont fix me but its so gut wrenching knowing that you dont have the skills or prospects that can make it possible its stopping me from even trying to make friends with women if they think i like them theyll probably be disgusted by me even though im scared to even let myself think that i might like someone i know that i should try to make friends with women first but im afraid they might label me a creep sensing my inexperience with talking to women let alone having female friends or a relationship its like i carry this secret with me like a badge of shame and i automatically defer any action about this to prevent myself from the humiliation that will result from it is there anyone out here who knows what this is like,3
whats with people calling you out and putting your mannerisms on the spot people i know make comments on my body movements or how i talk and it pisses me off you eat so little like a cat why do you take such small bites how you hold your phone looks funny why do you shake your legs why do you talk like that why do you laugh like that or imitating how i walk talk or move to be funny i dont get how its funny it makes me insecure about every little thing i do i noticed how they dont do this to other people that often its mostly me i sometimes end up being really stiff and monotone because i feel like im going to be called out for every little thing i do,3
i made a mistake on an incident report for a client i work with and instead of a supervisor bringing it up with me in person she brought it up in a virtual clinic wide meeting in front of people i had to turn off my camera so i could cry i hate myself for not being good at any kind of work for working a job that makes no money so i am stuck at my parents house i hate myself,3

as someone who has highfunctioning anxiety and avpd i really found it hard to develop relationships and take them to the next level i never had problems talking to strangers and i was just able to easily go about my day unless i am met with familiar faces i still study at a university and ive tried to invest more effort in socialising but to no surprise i wasnt making any progress despite exerting more of my resources for months straight i thought i was at a dead end so i just gave up i turned into this halfdead human who didnt give a fuck about anyone anymore it felt good for a few weeks but all throughout those days i had this lingering feeling that whatever the hell i was doing was wrong my rebellious phase eventually ended but i was still tired of trying to socialise ladies and gentlemen if i asked you what your next step here is what would it be you see us avpd folks are subconsciously feeling guilty and ashamed of ourselves because we assume and feel like we are not enough for the people we want to build relationships with take my advice and let us be and feel human for a change everyone is imperfect so dont put up a face or please people because you are enough humbling myself was the first thing i did as i was burntout from even trying to socialise i stayed put and just became me for a change i committed whenever i felt like it there is no secret code no secret formula no secret anything to socialising you just experience the moment and live life at the present take good example from your childhood brain where times where simpler because we still had no idea of the norms and societys symbols if you humble yourself and accept and approach every situation with humility and nonchalance you will find peace this is the power of kindness this is where the healing process of loving and respecting yourself begins going back to my story for the first time ever in years i felt peace peace with everything i dont want to forcefully strive myself to socialise with my peers because that is fake shit be of no responsibility do take note that ive seen big improvements in building relationships of course i was committing from time to time whenever i felt like it so ladies and gents dont try to divert the river of life because the water will deliver you to where you need to go feel free to dm me if you want more about how i remedied my avpd peace,3
sometimes for no apparent reason i just feel constantly guilty and ashamed of myself idek why its just a constant feeling in my chest,3
i recently got diagnosed with avpd after probably struggling with it for years i thought downloading reddit would give me some kind of comfort as there are communities on certain topics on here that are easily accessible but as im reading through posts i have zero desire to comment on anything or make any connection at all and exited the app with the thought of probably never replying to anything which is the irony of it all but i do wanna let you know of my existence i will probably not ask questions or share details of my disorder but i still exist and i still have a voice and fingers to type im real even if it sometimes doesnt feel that way thanks for reading,3

now that i think about it probably even more social anxietys a bitch but what really gets to me is how ill tear myself apart afterwards i cant let myself forgive or forget even the slightest fuck ups every stutter wrong word choice thinking i said something mean or dumb etc it doesnt matter if i did perfectly fine ill find something to criticize i tell myself im an idiot that im inferior that whoever i was talking to would be better off if i said nothing or if i wasnt alive i know that these are normal things that people dont remember and usually dont judge but i cant get it through my fucking head ive spent my entire life being mean to myself my inner critic is ruthless anyone else feel this way self compassion is completely foreign to me,3

theyre acting like were just doing this to be lazy its not our fault our brains are like this my birth giver is nagging and cussing me out for not going to school i understand that this could be frustrating for a parent but i already told her about my problem with going to school i risked that knowing that shes narcissistic and judgemental but even after all the explanations she still thinks going to school for me is easy she then goes on to say kids these days are so onion skinned which means someone who has shallow tears and then goes on and say i didnt spoil you kids didnt it ever occur to her that maybe im like this because she abused us as children that she screams at us every chance she gets that she didnt treat us with respect and neglected us its not just kids these days people have been battling with mental health for hundreds of years its just popular now because people actually value mental health now and are seeking for help its so funny because she acts so caring and worried when talking to my teacher but then acts so judgemental and close minded when talking to me,3
is this something new to our generation gen z or milennials or has it always been a thing why does everyone feel like they are experts in what everyone else should do especially when something bad happens and most of the time its something vague or obvious break the cycle you know better than this just be grateful for what you have live in the present use the resources youve been given make something of yourself anything but dont let your life go to waste and every single time theyre very fucking happy with themselves nothing more to say here wipes hands its the worst part when it comes from someone you consider a friend personally id expect friends to know how shit the world is and not give arrogant vague andor obvious advice why does everyone do this nowadays why is it so hard for you to just shut up and listen to what someone has to say no one does that ever,3
this is a difficult topic to discuss but im genuinely curious as to ifhow others have done this and what impact it has had on their lives the kind of acceptance im talking about isnt just an intellectual acknowledgement of having issues for a long time for example i could say to myself that im depressed anxious and struggling to succeed in life at least by metrics of the culture that i reside in thats relatively easy to do what im speaking of is a shift in perspective where you allow yourself to be disabled and accept living life very differently than what is expected in doing so you effectively turn off the mechanism that activates masking which exposes vulnerabilities and just say f it ill deal with the consequences this means that you accept that youll be targeted by others misunderstood and often viewed as low status because generally people arent very understanding of problems that arent obvious like a physical disability you accept that youre not likely to be appealingattractive to potential or existing romantic interests this is particularly salient to men who are selected for traits that showcase an ability to provide you accept that youll need emotional financial andor vocational assistance for the remainder of your adult years as such you must let go of a desire for a fully independent lifestyle you accept that in all likelihood what you have to say wont hold much value to others outside of a supportive setting maybe you didnt have much to say anyways you accept a humility of attitude and position you are no longer competing with others in the rat race at least not directly and have no need to get ahead and you accept that you werent motivated to do so to begin with moving mountains around just isnt your thing an image comes to mind of a disheveled man holding a sign on the street corner i imagine theres no pride left to speak of in someone like that just acceptance that the world isnt meant for some kinds of people i know this sounds depressing but this is where im at in considering how to proceed with my life it feels as though im flailing around grabbing at the air helplessly in some futile effort to grasp on to an ideal of something im not a normal selfsufficient person just to be clear i dont want to be homeless id hope to do just enough to avoid that but what this level of acceptance implies is a sense of freedom to be myself as i am in the present moment without fighting it the idea here is to do something radically different to change my outlook and ease the stress that im experiencing i would guess others here can relate to that stress which is the definition of avpd so has anyone taken this journey and would be willing to share some wisdom is this kind of acceptance a good idea or does anyone want to share their thoughts generally its important to add that this isnt a great idea for young folks this is something you would consider later on after having tried and tried again,3
im doing cbt and my therapist always asks me what im thinking and all i can say is i dont know because my mind always goes blank i cant articulate my emotions either and dont even know what i want in life today we did an exercise where i was supposed to have a conversation between my critical voice and my confident voice i told her im extremely uncomfortable doing it and she said its fine we dont have to but i wanted to try it anyways i could think of hundreds of things i hate about myself but not a single thing i liked about myself it was so awkward sitting there and not saying a positive thing my therapist even asked me if im having any suicidal thoughts afterwards thats how bad i must have looked when i looked in her eyes she seemed clueless like shes never seen anyone that bad and has no idea how to help me i dont believe my problems are something i can fix by just changing the way i think about myself i am not an interesting person im not an attractive person i just feel like theres nothing of value about me and people find me repulsive,3

i just want to sleep but i never feel rested and recovered i really want to make music but im only motivated around others i have some intrinsic motivation such as to make music but i keep getting discouraged to the utmost point by a lot of stuff dreaming of playing at festivals and having fun with people and then feeling like its just an impossible task to even try to start and to mention transgender trauma its just not easy to interact with others and its always this doom and gloom there is no time wasted time feeling of society and its machine of productivity i like being productive but i hate the pressure and if i dont feel motivated pressure is the alternative response kind and caring encouragement gives me space to debate when people dont want to debate it which kindof makes sense my point is im sad i cant live in a d world irl where i dont get misgendered and using the internet just to feel a sense of alleviation from dysphoria is fake because anyone can fake anything on the internet i wanted it to feel real as i could and i lost my insurance this is giving me a headache i didnt want to be x i wanted to replace my y chromosome end of story,3
moving out and away from people who have made you feel like shit just wondering if moving out has made anyone feel a bit better about things,3
so its been getting harder for me to keep a job im still trying as hard as i can i dont wanna been seen as weak for not being able to keep a job but its things i do very well and thats sing and make beats do you think someone with avpd have a chance in the music industry if i do the singing i know my anxiety would be crazy if i had to perform but i really have a passion for singing,3
anybody else start sweating like a whore in church on sunday when dealing with ppl,3
i wanna know how other people with avpd are when you like someonehave a crush personally i find it very painful i wonder if i feel too strongly the feeling is intense and i dont know how normal that is not talking to the person i like feels more painful than it should be maybe its an avpd thing ive heard it can be like this for people with bpd i have several bpd traits and im not too sure how it works but maybe thats why i feel like this,3
ive been seeing a guy for the last year and he has avpd theres times where he will completely isolate and go no contact which i understand is only him trying protect himself i just try my best to be patient and there for him when he is ready to reconnect i was wondering if anyone had any suggestions on how i could support him and possibly ease any suffering he may be going through i love him beyond words but i dont want to cause anymore discomfort than he may already be going through thanks heaps everyone,3
talking to someone and only hearing a voice or getting phone calls from an unknown number is exciting and terrifying like i already hate my voice mtf trans preop prevoicetraining and interacting is a mess due to trauma and needing to be all these defaults that im not just to get along which isnt even true im just too afraid to be myself but i often lose that but whatever thats not the point people only want to interact in phone calls like hey theres letters theres email theres texting there are nicer ways to interact but then again i just hate my face and voice which kinda makes both phone calls and real life really painful but at least im more used to real life despite the trauma,3
this might sound really weird as ive never heard about it here or anywhere else but ive noticed that when i make a mental effort especially to learn something new i seem to change my personality and i cant laugh i get surly my mood gets worse also i get hypervigilant when i see people on the street i look at them as if ive seen something scary if i dont study for a week my symptoms improve a lot and i become more sociable and relaxed ps studying means being focused for a period of time on trying to absorb some content well as mathematics or philosophy for example i know that everything i said may sound meaningless or strange but can someone enlighten me or give me some tips thank you very much in advance,3
i believe some days ago there was a post about being tired of importance of communication skills in life now theres kinda similar issue but with the pace that everythings is going with just my personal experience i am not speaking for everyone so last year i quit college cus i couldnt bear stress and deadlines i was pretty slow to understand and do things that was required professors or whatever theyre called sry not sure were pressuring us a lot with all that and so on i have a job as a stocker now but in about month or so i have to think about other options for studying collegesuniversities just some other field and that honestly makes my stomach twist its not about what i want its about how itll all go id love to spend my time studying art but i am so afraid of the process when i think about it i can imagine only flaws and mistakes id make there would be so much things to learn and practice but so little time to do all that and now to the title i hate that everything must be spinning crazy like that if you want to study you must be catching up quickly otherwise its immediately your one big ass problem and no one is willing to help you with that itd so damn cool if there was any way to get education on your own pace so you have enough time for everything i know its only in my dreams but i cant stop thinking about it i am so slow because my brain is so fried after all these years fighting this plague i dont know maybe its just me and i am that broken but its really so sad that i cant normally go towards my dreams and those fears arent even irrational same shit happened year ago and i know myself so damn well it couldnt be any way around sorry for such long bullshit vent i had to get it off my chest,3
i was already thinking about breaking up with him just because avpd made it too painful and scary to be in a relationship even when he didnt necessarily do anything wrong but its still gutwrenching im not necessarily heartbroken i just feel like shit because his reasoning boiled down to i get you have avpd and you cant help it but its your fault this isnt working out he was sick of me constantly ghosting him never directly communicating or confronting him about anything and he called me childish for being unable to have a difficult conversation like an adult i already feel guilty enough about the way avpd makes me act without someone i thought was understanding telling me exactly all the ways i ruined this for him all of which just so happen to be things i already constantly worry are reasons people avoid or despise me in situations like this people usually say some shit like its not you its me or go easy on you right not to mention one of his reasons was that i was ghosting him while i have been in animation crunch on a tight deadline so i genuinely didnt have the time or energy to even read messages whatsoever let alone respond which feels like maybe he shouldve been a tiny bit more understanding of but in terms of the big picture i guess i understand it still feels like shit though ive never been broken up with before and even though i wanted out since the week he first confessed to me i dont know if ill be able to get over this that easy just because he wanted me to know i was the bad boyfriend and everything i was insecure about i have every right to hate myself for edit after i panicblocked him on all social media he is now anonymously harassing me on tumblr to confront me about it and generally being very childish and kinda fucked up and creepy so maybe i dodged a bullet actually,3
im so insanely hedonistic i cant do anything that doesnt give me instant gratification i quit every single thing in life that didnt give me instant pleasure i cant see myself ever achieving things that i want from life it feels like i would need to become a completely different person if i wanted to get what i want from life theres times when i think that maybe the best thing i could do is to accept myself as im and that i should just give up on trying to change things,3
hi has anyone with this disorder done military service before i feel like the best times for my mental state and relationships with others have been when ive been forced to do things together and have a very regimented schedule and i dont think my current occupation is tenable for much longer i have a graduate degree in engineering so i was thinking perhaps trying to become an officer although im not so confident in my leadership ability perhaps for a support role such as intelligence or a pilot or some other more specialized service i guess as a bonus ive done a lot of milsim activities and hobbies throughout my life so far and i dont really have any relationships or people except my distant parents to tie me down to a specific location im not taking any medication and although ive brought up this disorder to my psychiatrist i havent received an official diagnosis one way or the other as its not their policy to label patients,3
maybe i just didnt develop a selfesteem high enough to be able to relate to that,3
just want to see if theres any correlationlink or if any types are moreless common here mine is infj,3
do you have a certain regimen are you taking meds going to therapy im suddenly feeling motivated to do something good for me and put my energy into my personal growth after neglecting it the last year or so i just dont know where to start yet any suggestions i already made an appointment with my psychologist i am willing to take meds again and to start working out,3
until i started reading about psychology and watching videos about it i dont think i understood myself or other people thoroughly i wish i had done this years ago because well school doesnt teach you this and my parents didnt teach me this at all they provided but they didnt truly parent me they were mainly focused on their own emotional needs without knowing it,3
hey yall im currently in rd year university in science and although i find things interesting sometimes most of the time it just feels like killing time im still working on completing my first year compulsory courses as ive taken a gap in between st year and now completing optional courses i thought were interesting honestly i feel like giving up at this point because i hate calculus and stupid prerequisites that have nothing to do with the degree environmental science they also make you take a billion optional coursesout of a small restricted list in order to graduate i feel like ill never find a career option that ill be satisfied with the days feel so long i have no motivation or drive i daydream most of the time and have a hard time focusing i want to exist without being expected to give but thats nearly impossible without just being homeless what do you have a career in and what has been your experience like working,3
how and why would i try being friends with people who say im an ugly useless fggot with no friends they literally make fun of how lonely i am and talk shit about me who in tf is going to talk to people who obviously hate them like most people talk shit about me when i try being nice and open they call me annoying weird or try to take advantage of me when im quiet and avoidant due to constant mistreatment they say im weird and creepy and a loser wtf do people want from me im so ducking exhausted dealing with people i feel like i cant trust anyone and the whole reason i dont try reaching out to people is because every time i thought i was friends with someone they talked shit about me secretly hated me how am i supposed to genuinely trust anyone after that,3
my whole life everyone has been at best indifferent to me amp often times just outright abusive to me the depths to which i feel alone cant even be put into words this isnt a new thing its always been this way but its really starting to hit me that im living for people who dont care to do a damn thing to help me amp maybe theres just something deeply wrong with me for no one to ever care about me at all i truly dont think i can keep going with no hope of ever having any connection with anyone amp i dont know what to do its not like i even have anything to live for for me my life is completely empty the only people i have around me demand so much of me ampor hurt me i dont think im even capable of building a better life amp if i am then i dont know if im capable of making it for that long with absolutely no help from anyone my whole life feels like such a waste ive never had any purpose,3
what do you guys think of the whole debate around whether social anxiety and avpd are the same disorder of course we arent professionals but i think we can still have our own input i was diagnosed with social anxiety when i was a month after i dropped out of school and became houseboundagoraphobic and because of that i wasnt able to understand the things i was truly struggling nor were the professionals able to understand when i ended up inpatient for the first time at age i couldnt leave my room until i was forced to wasnt able to talk to other patients or make friends every time i was in hospital or in some sort of program i had online friends but then i started becoming convinced that they hated me so i ended up ghosting every online friend i had when i was i discovered what avpd was and i was amazed by how much i related to every single thing about it even more so than i related to the diagnostic criteria of bpd which i was diagnosed with i brought up the idea of avpd to a psychiatrist last fall and she pretty just said i agree but also mentioned that theres debate on whether social anxiety and avpd are the same disorder so idek if she changed my diagnosis or not which kinda annoys me but whatever i just think from what i know about social anxiety is that well its obviously anxiety related so it deals more with anxious thoughts surrounding social activities avpd to me is more so the innate feelings that you are inept and that there is something deeply wrong with you to the core and thats why nobody likes you therefore you stay alone i just think theyre separate things because not everyone with social anxiety experiences that let me know what you guys think,3
just wondering how many people take general or playful razzing super poorly or personally for instance teasing between friends i have a few friends that tease me about some of my hobbies and interests some times i fluff it off other times i get super frustrated and almost angry with them and feel like im somehow stupid or inferior for liking the things i like just wondering if thats a normal thing or if it is part of the disorder view pollhttpswwwredditcompollwps,3
beyond emotional and sometimes physical neglect i always knew something was different about me and not in a good way i couldnt relate to my peers growing up and i could never figure out why i was always too much too loud too weird too emotional i never had the same interests as the other kids around me which made me sad because i wanted to but never did then theres the fact that i couldnt catch on to jokes quickly which made me awkward my poor attention span and memory made things worse sometimes my teacher would ask me to do a favor like grab something from a shelf and i couldnt follow directions this happened a lot growing up people getting frustrated with me or thinking theres something wrong with me because i couldnt follow directions this evolved into a massive fear of being embarrassed if someone was telling me where to go id need a visual a map or for me to write down their directions because ill get lost my short term memory is so bad i remember my uncle was giving me his phone number we were moving and he had to leave and come back but i needed to be in contact with him he recited the numbers and i couldnt remember what he said quick enough i just always felt like im slow to process things i still am someone will state a fact about themselves ill look them in the face and nod like i was listening but i wasnt so i repeat what they said back to them and they all give me this wtf look and they tell me they just said that a moment ago sometimes i forget the things i myself said and it would lead to me repeating myself multiple times again ending with people giving me this wtf is wrong with her look yikes it doesnt help that i think i deal with rejection sensitive dysphoria it takes very little for me to get flustered and embarrassed it led to me lashing out at others as a child which ofc led to me being excluded eventually i always overexpressed my emotions and i think that was off putting to other people when i was happy i was very happy when i felt a twinge of sadness i was crying when i was mad i was yelling and name calling i had overall weird impulsive behavior i would say the most random things and make really weird movements i still do but only at home lol i think all of these things just made others reject me because i was so strange and to avoid the harsh judgement i started masking all of my quirks but i lost myself in the process i went from one extreme to the other instead of being overly expressive i isolate myself and i come off as cold uncaring and stuck up but this couldnt be further from the truth i truly do care about people but im emotionally blocked off and still trying to mask those symptoms that make me seem weird sorry for all the rants and posts lately im not actually sad this time i think im just coming to accept theres a reason why i am the way i am and that im not just inherently defective,3
this is gonna sound maybe a little superficial but anyone feel embarrassed posting on social media because of how little friends they have like i know a post of mine is only gonna get a few likes and im almost embarrassed to post because then itll be obvious to those people how alone i am,3
how to stop ghosting people theres a point where trust is broken and youre afraid that they despise you this builds on top of your usual ghosting i guess ghosting should be stopped when trust is not broken what works to address this ghosting phenomenon,3
just found rfaces,3
i dont avoid people because im anxious or embarrassed or ugly or feel unwanted people try to make connections with me and i shut them down or ghost them i just refuse the effort and its not because its unwantedi wish i had friends i want to date i imagine what my life would be like if i wasnt me and it looks like a lot of fun i dont think im actually schizoid or anything i just dont have the drive to improve my life in the ways i know i should i have never been in a relationship but i have accounts on a couple different dating apps i put effort into my profiles and then i ignore every message i get when people try to talk to me in public i usually just walk away i dont know why engaging at all just doesnt seem possible it feels like writers block only its going to ruin my life its not like i had a traumatic childhood or anything i wasnt abused my parents werent narcissists i wasnt even particularly unpopular in school but even back then even in elementary school i would refuse any efforts to hang out outside the classroom i would never go over to my friends houses even though my mom always said yes most often i wouldnt even tell her i was invited and then i would feel sad from the isolation lol i dont really know what the point of this post is its more of a rambling vent than anything else i need to get it off my chest somehow my family is so confused by my behavior but i cant bring myself to talk to them about it somehow its easier on an anonymous subreddit im not even sure if this is allowed here since im not officially diagnosed when i was i went to a psychiatrist to get treatment for my ocd i didnt want to but the only other option was killing myself which i wanted to do less hes the one who brought avpd to my attention but he didnt give me a diagnosis that day he wanted me to come back for follow up appointments to narrow things down i refused i dont know why,3
this is going to be lengthy and ahead of time i want to apologize to anyone this might be sensitive to it involves an affair and im struggling to absolve myself for my part in it and have thought often that i might die of a broken heart over this ill begin with the story fully and what i need from all of you is help to see similarities in me thatd make me a bpd sufferer or her or what i am so mentally screwed up over this that its been hard to move on im almost months no contact as of right now the story begins at work i worked at a rehab facility in a health field she was at the orientation for our first day and she said later that id caught her eye and shed hoped to talk to me from the very first time shed seen me as i began to see her at work she started casually flirting once she needed equipment thatd take blood pressure and i said i only had my pox that does hr and spo she replied i want everything with a look as we began to really talk she revealed she had a husband even though she wore no wedding ring i thought she was beautiful and she was very observant later she said that she noticed me looking at her lips one of the first times wed spoken it progressed to innocent things like once id said me and a coworker missed her while shed been off for a week or so she came up to me later in the shift and excitedly and red in the face said you missed me when helping a patient up from bed shed placed her hand firmly over mine as i held onto his walker little flirty things like this intrigued me i know that i should not have proceeded but i could tell that she was unhappy and i did feel like she was truly deserving of more happiness she was from moldova and her husband was russian theyd been married for i believe years and had a son who was years old i began to pursue her a little more and wrote lists of things to do nearby that were fun although shed been in the us for years shed never been to a movie once in that time i was so sad and just thought this girl needs to experience the lighter side of life finally one day we exchanged instagram information and soon began talking on there she wasnt quick to reveal too much about herself but was definitely initiating conversation frequently as we began talking it progressed relatively quickly after a month and a half we were meeting for the first time outside of work it was around this time that she told me prior to meeting me shed planned to leave her husband and just be alone i tried inviting her to a movie but she kept insisting that she wanted to come over to my place when discussing this she was talking about seating and how we wouldnt be doing anything and all of that i told her the tv was in my room and all i had in there was my bed she was kind of trying to say that there could be no contact and all of that well within seconds of shutting the door behind her we were making out for the entire time she was over we made out she even shook my bedpost when she got into my bed i know she would have gone all the way if id tried this is when there were things she finally said that shook me a little she told me she broke up with one guy because he didnt kiss good and stuff like that she told me eventually that people when she worked at amazon offered a threesome with her i have no idea how that conversation even began she began to sound almost manic with the things shed say as if id freed some mind that was eager to be free she told me once that she wasnt ready to date older men because she wasnt ready for that when we ate tacos for the first time she said she was ready to date because i joked that all women like tacos and margs on their dating profiles she told me there were times she thought she loved her husband it was largely like a business relationship where they occupied separate parts of the house and just worked together for the practical purposes of a relationship kids home money she even told me he had cameras inside the house that hed watch and monitor as i started to become more attached to her i became more nervous and more fearful it was at this time she made a reference to the effect of me being her favorite person and something along the lines of shed let anyone go before letting me go meaning friends etc the situation to me as it began was that this girl was wonderful and id have been a fool to let her life go by without joy and happiness she truly was to me someone very special one of the first things she texted me on instagram was that she perceived me to be less happy than i appeared at work she just seemed so genuine to me but as time went on i feared that maybe i couldnt trust her she revealed a lot about her childhood but not much about the emotions she felt like i know she had a tumultuous upbringing she literally lived in a village with a bed that was above a wooden stove that heated it beneath i know her dad whipped her and her brother she was unfairly responsible for a lot as a kid she also revealed she had a bout of bulimia in high school she told me they were told more often that they did something wrong rather than be congratulated for good work she didnt like me complimenting her too much she would try to change the subject if id say much to that effect she didnt like when i gave her positive reinforcement either like if i said i appreciated something shed say i was trying to train her one thing id said i appreciate was when she sent photos of home like what she was doing or what her son and her were doing i just liked feeling as if i was included in her life i spoiled the hell out of her i brought her food and everything i could each time we worked together about once a week what happened though eventually was we had a night together finally a month or so after our first kiss i did not perform well the anxiety of it all and the feeling that i was being told when and if things are going to happen this wasnt like im feeling horny and you are right next to me this was im coming over this day and were going to get it on im and my sex drive isnt quite that great and add in this whole complicated situation and well it didnt go well this was the first time she said i love you though when we were doing other things in bed together i became nervous about my failure to perform i didnt discuss with her the reason or anything regarding it so that was likely my mistake the next time we saw each other and i said i love you she said can we not say i love you so much that shook me because i didnt know what it meant like holidays lol i told her to not tell me how to love her and she accepted that although it probably bred contempt fast forward a couple weeks and we are in the car after work and i saw her getting close to another coworker at work this coworker later said he felt some vibes from her too but once he saw wed become close he didnt think any more of it when i saw them two close i asked her about it she said you doubt my feelings for you she got upset and rightfully so later that day she was very panicked and called to say that she was shook up by it now our birthdays are approaching id thought wed see each other on my birthday no we didnt then her birthday was the day after mine didnt see each other that day either then another days or so went by and she didnt come over or anything just prior to what happened next she sent me the music video for wicked game paranoia took over me and i just asked after a day where communication was kind of lacking between us if she was distancing herself she told me that no she wasnt distancing herself and that a healthy relationship is two people living separately with separate interests and coming together in the middle to share then she said at the time that now she felt worse and that i felt better two days later and she called to break up with me and said love is not enough that was the blackest my life has ever seemed i had never experienced anything like it like i was just floating through a sea of nothingness the very next day she texted to say she still thought of me and that she was worried i just told her that i couldnt help her feel better about her decision to break up at that time almost a week went by and she called me i didnt answer because i figured if it were important she would have called again curiosity got the better of me a couple days later and i called her back she answered and we spoke she said that she had to become better at disappointing me she told me it would take some time to get back to normal between us but it didnt take long she revealed that shed written in the birthday card she got me but never gave me that i made her want to have kids again she later revealed that she feared and projected that id be jealous of the time devoted to our children over me the fantasies continued and she envisioned us growing old together and that wed rest when we were old she is a very hard worker ive never met anyone so goal oriented in my life she was truly busy and between her husband not helping her her son school and work she was truly doing it all i can tell that my persistent need for attention probably bothered her but as i became closer i could no longer act cool after we got back together she suggested we go to the movies i was so happy to finally do something with her outside of work or just spending a night together some time to finally bond and enjoy ourselves just sounded great to me i had a great time and i thought she did too she said before we went into the movie that she was sorry and that shed never forgive herself for what shed done when she broke up with me she told me when shed broken up she stowed away everything id given her and deleted our conversation on instagram she also revealed that it was a time where she considered going to therapy or doing a virtual session this was i think one of two times shed ever say she was sorry to me i dont remember when it was that shed said this but it was either before this breakup or somewhere else in the middle of all of this but she said i need to love you less thats not a good thing to hear this period was probably the best time of our relationship she even entrusted me to watch her son while she went to an eye appointment it was moments like these that i needed where i actually felt valuable to her i didnt think much of myself outside of opportunities like this a week or so after our night at the movies she came over again to my place when she came over this time i performed better but still not well enough i think i went like minutes and then just lost it for whatever reason im not a very experienced guy and i never really talked about it with her because i thought shed think less of me a few more weeks go by and she says that she can no longer spend time with me after work wed have like twenty minutes between us after a shift and of course i assumed incorrectly it was because of me i needed reassurance probably a little too often i dont know if it was the nature of the relationship the first breakup or what it was but i felt on edge she assured me it wasnt because of me that she didnt want to or couldnt stay after work she said her husband found a innocent picture that id given her of me i knew that a lot of what id given her was stowed away so i wondered how only this picture was found he then deduced that i was a person on her instagram from my photo she warned me to not text her and that shed contact me this went on for a little while successfully until one morning i sent her a couple of messages on instagram he was actually online on her instagram and saw the messages where id said i love you she didnt contact me the rest of the day so i knew something was wrong that night i called her and she answered crying she said that hed told her she was a bad mother and all sorts of terrible things he also messaged me the next day saying i hear you are very good friends with my wife i also want to be friends i told her about this and she begged me not to reply and to block him a few hours later he had blocked me she told me hed even planned to send me pregnancy photos of her it was truly messed up this whole situation is i know when he blocked me i wondered why she told me he was viewing the messages over and over she told me he was planning to tell his parents and that it would be soon discussed within the family i never heard much about it after that my paranoia increased a few weeks went by and we had some intimate encounters but she still wasnt coming over to spend the night at all i felt maybe that was due to my inability to really perform but i wasnt sure after her husband found out though understandably there wasnt as much communication between her and i now i waited for her to initiate everything i waited for phone calls i waited for texts one day she texted me precisely before i began work and i said it meant a lot that she did that because it was something she used to do she told me i was trying to train her we never had real quality time together work was really the best thing we had between the two of us this is where it all began to break one day i exchanged just a couple texts with her even though it was against the rules and i never received a call i had a spell of emotions come over me and i got upset i said some rough things nothing too crazy the next day we spoke and i said asked her if she was happy she said if she still calls and i still answer that were happy she then began dissecting what i was really asking and she came to the conclusion that i was actually saying that i wasnt happy i felt our communication was so difficult and we hadnt spent any real quality time together by this time since the movies and our one night together she told me she doesnt do reassurance she said shed have to take time to herself and shed miss me and stuff but shed not really be speaking to me the next week or more i just got texts saying things like i miss you cant talk good morning this went on and on for like i said over a week i was getting really affected by it there i was the other man in this whole thing and im wondering how important am i after all she has a husband and a life outside of our relationship she was absolutely my primary partner i finally got upset and sent her a text that was lengthy and said dont contact me i dont know what is going on i dont have clarity on anything etc she must have had my phone number blocked because the next morning i received another good morning message so i sent another similar message again this one was delivered because she didnt say anything at all ill admit i wanted her to fight for our relationship i wanted her to see how difficult this was for me i understand that i was wreaking havoc on her life to some extent i was definitely a hindrance to any stability in her life well after nothing came to me within a couple of days i freaked out i went back on everything id said and apologized profusely and went on and on with a whole bunch of texts and calls like a whole bunch i was so fearful and felt like i was digging myself deeper and deeper into a hole that id been responsible for i still felt i was owed some clarity on her stance with her husband and what was happening behind the scenes but i knew that i was screwing up after all of this she said it was toxic and that i was frightening her after she said that i lost it i was supposed to work with her that night and i called off because i couldnt fathom being near her when shed said i frightened her well that night she was super pissed she said that i was acting like an year old boy not a year old man she said there was no more us at work no more spending time together no more talking no more anything i was shook up by this as id been by everything before it i told her honestly that when id called off that my manager knew it was because of some disagreement between her and i i had known my manager for years and she was a friend so i didnt think much of it after she said all of this there is no more us stuff several more days went by and i decided to resign from the job she talked to me finally a couple days after the day i resigned when we spoke she said that her dad never understood her mom and she was fearful because i didnt understand her at the end of the call i revealed to her that i quit the job she abruptly hung up on me and later told me that she began to cry after i told her id done it because of what she said she later texted me and said she wanted me to let her go this where things got really messy she told me she wanted to be single i told her i need time to move on she replied i will not remind you of myself i told her she could write a letter if she ever had some clarity on all of this she replied i will not send a letter i dont like writing letters a few days again went by and i tried reaching out to her she asked me what id done in those few days apart i told her that id done nothing meaning i hadnt been with anyone else when we began talking again things got rough she began trying to lose weight she asked if it was because i was nervous why i hadnt performed well in bed i told her that it was but she questioned whether it was her body she talked about getting breast implants she told me that the beginning was fantasy and that itd never be like that again she once texted me and said that she missed me more than i even knew but that she cant be vulnerable she said that she needed to learn to love not me she said so many things during this period that makes me question everything today i know women can be emotional and i was definitely emotional enough for the both of us but this was next level after a struggle to see her she finally said she wanted to see me when i did i felt just as we always had together the butterflies and like she was just the most beautiful girl id ever laid my eyes on she allowed me to touch her intimately when we had this meeting but it was almost the last time shed allow me to do so what happened in the weeks following was my job was reinstated because my resignation was never given to anyone above my manager she didnt forward it so that she could protect my employment in case i changed my mind when we worked together those next few weeks there was some contentiousness between us one night she was upset because something regarding her parents immigration wasnt going well she did not tell me what it was initially i always wanted to know what was bothering her and i was sensitive to her moods my life with her felt so microscopic each interaction was magnified each gesture became what id live with for the next week as we spent time apart i was often visibly disappointed when she would not share what was going on she was very good at reading my expressions she stormed off and when i caught up with her she had her pants hiked up really high near this one male nurse we worked with i thought something of this because shed said she did that near me initially when we began our little courtship later that night i said i wanted her to be happy that i wanted to have a good time she asked what i meant by a good time i said that i wanted to have fun that we never had any opportunities to just have fun together it was soon after that i decided to go back to school to better myself and to impress my gf i guess when i did so she took one of the classes with me so wed have monday nights together in class our job soon closed because the building it was in was no longer going to be serviced this left us only with our class together she would never come over ever again to my place after our argument involving work i did my best each week to spoil her i made salmon salad that i kept on ice in the car and wed eat it after class released i got her a spa package to enjoy so that she could just a take a minute to relax i really missed her i really really really missed her i needed time with her to really bond her life was undoubtedly busy but the lack of quality time we had together came off as disinterest to me i became so attached but so worried about the previous damaged id done that i began to spiral in the class we had a good time initially there was even one week where he had cancelled class and we had like an hour and a half together it was great i felt just happy to finally have uninterrupted time with her she asked me during that time jokingly if i had brought the salmon salad again for her also id gotten her a whole box of candies that she liked since childhood called bounty she asked where they were and why id not given them to her she told me she liked seeing my reaction when i was asked things like this when i told her i hadnt eaten them because id had enough sweets she asked who have you been getting sweets with i just said a friend of mine will i felt so awkward because she had not been paying much attention to me prior to this night we had together texts were more sporadic and often mine that i sent werent replied to we still spoke every day pretty much but there was never much to talk about i craved shared experiences and a sense of security id done my part to ruin things but it felt like this was all being sabotaged one day i called her after i got out of a therapy session and asked her how do i ask for what i need i was being starved i felt overwhelmed by how much i felt i was being ignored however i do know during this time she wasnt caring for herself much either she was irritated when i asked this of her one night near the very end i offered her a betterhelp therapy membership i told her it was the best thing that i could give her i had already tried brightening her spirits with the spa gift and the other little things id tried to do she said she didnt want to go and that only she could decide when it was necessary to go she told me she didnt like how i was trying to change her another week near the end i sat next to her in class like always after class she asked me why my legs were so far from her legs beneath the table i certainly felt the pushpull behavior i know she had a lot on her plate but i was single i didnt have all of these responsibilities and dramas i was focused on her a little too much maybe i didnt know if shed done this before why the cameras in the house why the invitation of a threesome i didnt know if i was really important my mind raced and raced one of the final days we had i asked her in a text if i ask to spend more time with her isnt that something shed want to do because she loves me the next day we spoke on the phone and i asked her to reply to that when she could she said that i cant ask someone to do that shed reply whenif she was ready to do so i was struggling so much i have thought at times i might die of a broken heart over this what finally happened was her son was sick she told me the day before we had class together that she needed a break and requested that i dont text her i agreed and the next day we saw each other in class i broke i asked her if shed have any time for us after class she just shook her head no i snapped i began just staring at her intermittently for a good ten minutes or so sulking in the chair next to her i was probably a real sorry sight to see she looked to me and said well talk after class i made some passive aggressive remarks about borrowing a pen and stuff but nothing too bad when we got out of class i was immediately upset she patronizingly said lets have a discussion as if i hadnt been trying to have one all along about my needs i said did you talk to your husband today she said i have to he has my son i replied well nothing for me then huh the lets have a discussion remark made me begin to crack a smile she did not like that because i just thought to myself how ridiculous is all of this i love her i still do how on earth could she not see how ridiculous it had all become and how it practically was from the start the argument went mostly like that for just another minute or so before she began walking away i followed and she said i dont like the way you love your love is overwhelming she got in the car and as i tried to offer her a water i had brought for her she said i dont want anything from you anymore she had headaches a lot and one night she drank and ate the ice from the salmon salad on her way home thats why i had brought the water for her she went home and i went to meet up with my one friend i called her and left a voicemail that said something like i wish you the best in all the things you have going on i hope you learn to love and accept love the next day i hadnt yet heard from her and i texted her when i did she told me that maybe a business relationship is what she needs she cant handle arguments in love she told me she went home had a few drinks and considered her husbands proposal to get back together by that she meant they had sex she told me that what we had wasnt special that it was in my head one thing she asked was why i smiled i said i couldnt believe i was being treated like this she replied youre saying im a bad partner i said ive been asking you for weeks to see you i just couldnt believe the whole thing she acts concerned about such a thing after admitting to having sex with her husband her mind truly was chaotic where was she when i was breaking at the seams over our lack of time together we have not communicated at all since that night the last thing i sent was one heart emoji i had no words from her to say anything about what i meant nothing i have cried so much over the last few months i think often about the day that i die and if i might be able to call her and see her one last time so that we might be able to imagine what it might have been if wed had a chance a real chance i dont know i blame myself i know that i might have a problem maybe we both have a problem i dont know anything anymore it was real to me maybe i was just being used if i could go back i would have stopped it from progressing as far as it did i felt my confidence and my security change once it advanced i dont know what does this mean to you guys on here ive read a lot of bpd narc stuff youtube reddit you name it do i have a problem is how i acted aside from beginning this affair in the first place that outlandish why didnt she understand how i might feel being in my position was this just a natural breakdown of an affair did i really mean nothing how do i move on from this how was this a genuine relationship with none of the healthy aspects a relationship has is it because she has a different outlook on love culturally is it because she sabotages relationships i cant see how any intimate relationship with her could succeed there doesnt seem to be any consistency i am so confused thank you to anyone who reads and dissects this whole thing thanks for any hesitance to pass judgement onto me,3
first i want to say that i am not diagnosed ive seen quite a lot of posts about this urge to disappear on rschizoidhttpswwwredditcomrschizoid and also ravpdhttpswwwredditcomravpd i am kind of glad that i am not the only one who does this i constantly delete my social media and start over by doing this i also ghost all of my friends on discord with social media like reddit twitch and others creating new accounts isnt a problem for me because i dont post anything i only keep my steam account i always knew its not normal i didnt know other people also struggle with this my friends are annoyed whenever i come up with a new discord account i really dont want to talk to them about this its hard for me to talk about my feelings with people i know i feel like they wouldnt understand me andor would judge me most of my friends ive known since i usually just come up with a dumb excuse like i forgot my password or something like that i want to explain the weird urge i get whenever i feel like disappearing under a post there was this comment gtthere was a point where i realized i was getting very good at starting things because after a certain point i would get that urge to restart not just with accounts but with everything id plan out how i was going to use an account build a new habit accomplish some goal as efficiently and optimally as possible and for a while follow through eventually i would drift off track a little let it eat at me and then give up and decide ill start over and do it better at this point i struggle to get to the im going to try stage and usually just dont bother the apathy does help me push through failure or perceived shortcomings a little more this comment describes my situation very accurately i feel almost exactly as this guy creating new accounts has become a routine i feel like it even calms me and is the closest thing to running away from everything its kind of hard to explain how i feel i ghosted my friends like weeks ago throughout the weeks ive tried to start over but i always fail and just start over once again i didnt tell anyone ill disappear i deleted my discord and now im gone my friend texted me on snapchat asking why i deleted my account i just responded with something like yeah lol didnt even give an answer ever since then i havent talked to them i want to but i know im gonna disappear after a month i also dont want to explain to them why i deleted my account because i cant even do it right now where i am anonymous probably a lot of mistakes very unorganized post but yeah i hate this i just want to be normal,3
as the title says im so sensitive to rejection that the smallest amount of desinterest banter or subtle mockery can send me into a suicidal episode with the never going to be good enough mantra at its core im presented with the chance of entering a relationship but im literally scared shitless ugh just wanna pull away,3
i live across the country far away from any family for the most part im very lonely and have been lonely for the majority of my life due to all sorts is issues and trauma since i was a kid i have a few friends that i occasionally meet but i dont regularly talk to outside of that i rarely talk to my family as i dont have a close relationship with them i went to college and met people there but i havent kept in touch with anyone from college after graduating most of the people who know me in life have no clue what im doing or even how my life is right now they havent heard from me in ages if i ever went missing they would probably never find out if i ever died the people who have known me in life would probably never find out the only people who would know anything are my coworkers doctors and family they would only find out if my work requested a check on me after not showing up for work for a while family would most like be notified through that doctors would only find out i was gone once i stop answering calls and showing up for appointments this is just scary to think about ive lived alone my whole and there is a good chance i would die alone life just sucks man why couldnt i just have had a normal life,3
hey guys im a f and im very lonely these days ive been going back and forth on wether i should post this but here goes i recently lost someone who i thought was a friend he wasnt anyways we used to call each other and watch movies thru the phone or tv shows sometimes also smoke weed while we watched my question is do any of you have a desire to do this with me i work long hours outside and then my bf does band practice so im alone a lot during the weekends or evenings obviously i know this post begging for human connection is sad but feel free to reach out my dms are open,3
like most of the videos i find about avpd just states what it is and then ends with yeah this isnt curable then you venture into the comments and see people complaining about their partner with this disorder,3
my main way i avoid people is by playing devils advocate being cold extreme opinions saying rude things or sticking to superficial topics i often compusively make myself the villian with friends not because i want to but because having them hate me is secretly doing them a favor from all the post ive read alot of avpd people sound like push overs or like eeyore from winnie the pooh im starting wonder how many people play out their avpd like me or if im got some other underlying disorder like odd or im just an ahole can someone confirm this,3
hey guys gals and enby pals its been a hot minute since ive posted here that was on my old account though my name is ciara im a year old trans girl and i have avpdobviously lol since i use to post ive made some decent progress i managed to get a job in i shit you not retail i actually managed to hold it down for a couple months even lol heck in a few instances i even was kind of good at it but eventually i cracked and quit i could only get ignored or misgendered so many times now im back at square one i know i can push myself but my endurance seems so fickle although i do have some confidence i know im not inferior took me a long time get there but i know im gonna have to put myself back out into the world soon i cant be a neet again idk where im going with this i just kind of felt like venting a bit,3
im and havent had a friend in years isolated myself from the world for eight months so i fell so so hard for this guy just cuz he flirted with me and now it seems so obvious he was just messing with me cuz he didnt answer like half of my texts till days later and never actually asked me anything about myself but i made excuses because i thought i was being like clingy and not understanding how relationships work but no if a guy likes you hes gonna show interest and actually answer your texts its a little weird because im paranoid so i assume everything means everyone hates me but now that im aware of this im trying to stop it but i went too far in the opposite direction now and ignored my good judgement because im so inexperienced socially,3
our cat who i love dearly has been missing for nights now and shes never stayed outside for more than a few hours in the entire last years that weve lived here so im really worried it sucks having no friends sometimes i wish i had a single good friend i could talk to,3
im trying to understand if its because my partner is selfish or its because of avpd will take and take and take and ask for more and state i dont do anything will never do nice gestures for me such as offer to pick me up drop me off take me to lunch be affectionate anything really treat me like a doormat cancel plans on me last minute prioritize commitments with random people disregard my feelingsthoughts were moving in and our place is going to be used as a business place with clients sitting in the living room all day and evening never take any responsibility always contort discussions criticisms and play victim i understand a lot of avpd behaviors are rooted in shame and self doubt but i dont see how that applies to the above behaviors i would describe her as a high functioning avpd ive read some posts from similar people and by her own words she feels like she is wearing a mask around other people all the time also seems shes used to using and disregarding partnersmen her life long friend called her out on this edit i needed some clarity and validation i do not think this is avpd which is why i had to ask also was looking for experiences from those in similar situations with mine or those with avpd thank you for the replies especially the detailed one from uculturalabrocoma,3
so my brand is of avpd is very not giving a f about others i care about people but in a relationship context i do not care i sometime tell new people that ask for instagram or contact i dont need anymore friends ive learned to put a super cold front to avoid people however there is a subset of people that go harder the more i push or ghost them away i typically find that they are approvalpeople seeking and want to be liked by everyone so often times a friendship with me is hard one with them doing percent of the effort do you guys find this as a pattern,3
for example missed opportunity to get to know someone who showed interest in you or job opportunities and the likes,3
to be clear im not talking about drifting away from each other over time but rather like getting ditched where it all happens in a few minutes or less this has happened to me a few times but the worst time was a few days ago because it happened with the closest friend ive ever had it actually happened with them a few months ago too i also feel bad for feeling like this and trying hard to not push them away but just cant control these feelings a few days ago we were playing an online game together as we often do and after a while they mentioned that they were also talking to another friend while playing and i realized that was why they were so quiet compared to all the other times i started shutting down after that but kept playing together for a few hours we didnt say anything but i knew they were talking to the other friend instead they did say bye when they were getting off and for the first time i didnt say anything back still havent said anything and feel bad cause we are the best friends each other has ever had and i know for sure it is true for them they are not lying but just cant help these feelings of not wanting to talk to them anymore and pushing them away i feel so ridiculous for feeling like this like for them its just a normal interaction with someone else and not knowing how bad it made me feel,3
im a yo male never really had much experience with women and all attempts have ended in catastrophe i mean ive officially thrown in the towel my friend is insistent on taking me to a strip club and im worried i feel a lot of dread and anxiety about it he keeps saying things like youre not feeling anxiety thats anticipation im going to end up going because i dont want to disappoint especially because hes paying but im curious if any of you have been to a strip club what was your experience like,3
hello after year of life i am finally trying to make a relationship i met a girl in the university i make the first move and i introduced myself to hermy first time in my life introduction myself to another person and it was great she was so nice and we start talking i felt like i am a human being but i think i got myself into trouble i met her in a another fast break but i didnt know how to talk to her and i felt so anxious i am afraid that if i ask her again she will refuse,3
ive seen two posts of two extremes in the past hours here and rsocialanxiety one that went wellhttpsreddittpr ended with a kiss and one that apparently was awfulhttpsreddittwsh but still a growing experience so i figured id report my experience that was somewhere in the middle recently had a girl message me on tinder and the conversation went really wellflowed really naturally she suggested we meet up and considering how much ive progressed recently i figured i wouldnt give myself enough time to reconsiderdoubt myself and just said yes i was pretty chill for the most part but my nerves got the best of me once there were only two hours left before the date but it still wasnt nearly as bad as it wouldve been before the date went pretty well i was pretty nervous but nothing that was overwhelming we walked and talked a bunch went to a small art exhibition grabbed some ice cream and then i had to leave overall a very pleasant experience despite the nervousness i would have neeever in my life had thought that id be able to go on a tinder date fully sober in the past i had to get blackout drunk other drugs to even text people on tinder so im very very very glad i had the power in me to not cancel or chicken out and actually go through with this even if nothing might come of it ill definitely have more confidence moving forward thanks to this experience good luck out there,3
abandon my entire life leaving everyone and everything behind or just kill myself or both i let the closest friendships ive ever had die because i cant be a normal person i never contact people first because i feel like im rudely intruding whenever i present myself to someone in any fashion i dont even call my own family members and tell them i love them because it feels like anything i do is placing a burden on others i dont have a plan i just wanna drive until i run out of money i just wanna experience what life is like without having the people you know perceive your actions even if its just for a short time before i eventually succumb to my suicidal ideation,3
do any of you have both i read that when you have avoudantdismissive attachment style you have often good selfconfidence and thats why you cant have avpd is that true i think they are two different things and while you may feel like you can do things best yourself it doesnt mean you cant feel shame an inferior to others,3
something gay man here while ive been in therapy for most of my life because i was always dealing with dysthymia persistent depression attachment issues were never discovered or diagnosed a year ago tms put my depression into remission which has been amazing awesome endless superlatives however with pdd no longer fouling the view surprisesurprise i see now that dismissiveavoidant attachment has been playing merrily in my psyche my attention having been elsewhere ive never had a real deep intimate sexual relationship sex yes friends yes but again none particularly deep distancing closed off difficulty trusting from what i can tell da has influenced inhibited even impaired a lot of areas of my life id like to fix or improve those if i can to be honest im a bit concerned read scared that i wont be able to do that da is a hard one to move to secure attachment from reading it looks like it basically takes an intimate sa partner and therapy to change an attachment style since i havent even had a crappy intimate relationship that seemsunlikely lol i have therapist right now weve talked a bit about this hes not an expert certified in attachment therapy cognitive behavioral yes general support especially with the tms stuff yes given the seeming intractability of da im wondering if hes right for tackling this i know da is an error in cognition but its also wrapped up in feelings and in behaviors that im not even aware of trauma family of origin stuff theres a lot that goes into da and while ive tackled much of this in regular therapy ive never come at it from an attachment angle with someone who specialized in attachment theory and styles so in your opinion is it better to have a therapist that specializes in attachment issues or is that not necessary will an attachment group or class suffice is changing therapists reasonable here im up for doing that or is that idea someone just another sign of avoidant dismissing behavior while i aint dead and have no plans on dying anytime soon or later for that matter i would like to fix this da before i shuffle off along those lines id like to stumble and fail at a real relationship or two i know da is hard to lessen on the off chance that i just succeed at one i want to improve my life im just trying to figure out the best way to go at it any advice here would be great,3
hey everyone so im a trans woman who is completely and utterly confused by sex ive somehow managed to have sex with multiple different people yet every time i feel wayyyyyyyy too anxious to actually enjoy any of the pleasure and instead delegate myself to please my partner instead when i think about sex it seems appealing but whenever i actually get to have it i cant help but panic and be scared that im not good enough for them is this normal can anyone else relate i dont think i am asexual since im very much so attracted to men and women and everything in between but any advice would be nice,3
all i did was stand awkwardly by myself in the middle of the room the whole time despite drinking and smoking some weed i felt too aware of myself and any potential eyes on me im always so utterly restricted i never let myself have any fun never dance never play any drinking games participate in karaoke etc because i dont want to people to judge how badly i am doing im scared they would want nothing to do with me if they see how bad at i am at everything im literally terrified of any selfexpression and i wish just once i could be normal and let loose and just have fun,3
im m up to this point i have had next to zero experience with dating or women in general i started chatting again with this girl that i had ghosted after asking her out on another app almost exactly a year ago i was surprised that she would match with me again this time i decided to go trough with it though what helped i think is that she is of a pretty similar personality type as me not a big time texter and sometimes slow to respond etc i decided to be just totally honest when we met i told her im not the most exciting guy and that im pretty boring honestly but i said it with kind of a smile and a good attitude we ended up holding hands walking trough the city and i kissed her on the way to my car and again when i dropped her off it felt like there might be some hope after all she asked me what we should do next time and i had no answer because i hadnt even considered it could ever come to that ampxb i just had to tell someone im not trying to brag if anything its an example that even if your feel inadequate and unworthy like i do often its mostly on the inside ive told myself noone will ever like me this is simply untrue and if you feel this way its most likely untrue for you too,3
of anything of something that you told yourself that turned out to be wrong of something someone did maybe once maybe multiple times maybe all the time of the way you saw life for everyone around you that on top of the first two who else just cant let go of someone or something or many people and many things,3
and i know this wont work but idk what else to do i just genuinely hate myself and i hope that maybe if i hit my goal weight i can finally have the confidence to talk to people and not feel so awful every social interaction feels like im being analyzed under a petri dish logically i know this isnt true but it feels true this causes me to put on an act which causes me to not be present with people which causes the awkwardness that i fear im focused on my facial expressions if im saying the right words with the right tone of voice my mind goes blank half the time i know that people typically enjoy it when you ask about them and their interests yet for some reason i just struggle to talk i start stuttering slurring my words or going so overboard on sounding perfect that i sound like a robot reading off a script i just want to relax and enjoy myself sometimes im able to most times im not im always waiting to feel embarrassed and then i go back to isolating myself the motivation for change is there but im soooo scared and exhausted,3
is it usual for people with avpd to get unomfortable around their friendsfamily if they spend too much time in one go or know too much about them do they often ghost their friends,3

i was going to go to a meet up group that eats different food around the city and then i canceled i was so excited and hopeful about making friends but then i realized how since i got divorced i look so much older and so much chubbier i felt i would be able to sense by their reaction to me that i am not good enough and i dont belong so i canceled i feel sad about it also i never have money and i had a little extra cash so this is one of the few times i was going to be able to afford this group i just dont have anyone to talk to about this and i feel sad and silly,3
i sigh a lot its just a habit i developed after years of fighting my broken brain and its annoying because when i am around people and do that it apparently gives them feeling like i am tired of them or even irritated while in fact i am just tired every single second of my life its not exactly avpd trait i think its more about being mentally ill in general its especially troubling during my work no actual meaning behind all that just vent about annoying shit in everyday life,3
lately i been watching youtube videos about assertiveness and confidence but i feel like i cant put it in act because i believe if i will start to get assertive i would end up in some conflict so i get in a state of fear of my actions lately im really confused about my behaviours probably watching even more stuff makes me overthinking even more i cant relax a bit when im outside i focus only on my body language and i feel like im not real sometimes and confidence means illusion for me my life is empty i believe i will get disappointed if i illude myself with this fake confidence in life,3
ive been feeling like shit the past few days and i cant help but tie it in with the suffocating loneliness and the fear of everything i cant be alone in this right,3
im sick of always being wrong no matter what i do and am expected to know what i did wrong im tired of constant arguments and always feeling like a shitty human being in the end when i dont even know what i did im just sick of being misunderstood and never given a chance to explain and my friend knows im avoidant but doesnt seem to fucking care how i feel anymore things were great at first happy fun friendship lalala and then they became really clingy and wanted to be my favorite i felt happy at first at the idea because wowww someone really likes me that much then they would always wanna be better than my friends call and shower me with compliments it was sweet and flattering at first then we got into some confusing relationship thing they never clearly defined what it even was i was too afraid to back out it got overwhelming and eventually i found myself distancing away i was really confused about it all they explained things terribly i never knew what exactly they wanted it was never clear what i did wrong what we were their intentions anything they seemed to expect me to know it all but fucking hell i really dont i cant read into things so easily maybe im flat out stupid i told them about avpd and such and they understood and were really nice and understanding at first then more arguments accusations guilt tripping i get it i was also a shithead in this situation i think the guilt tripping manipulation expectations them acting like a victim im really drained ive apologized over and over and cried often and its fucked me up i know im not perfect but i try my best to be kind and always have good intentions and i tell them that and oh my god they dont get it at all theyre a genuinely nice person and i know that im just so tired of the anger i cant take it no offense to those who have bpd this person in particular has no self awareness or anything and i guess they totally just blew off my avpd and just shit on me and it really hurts,3
hi so im diagnosed with autism and years ago about i was diagnosed with social anxiety as well i recently found out about avpd and i feel like i relate to the majority of symptoms ive found i checked on the autism subreddit about this but i found someone arguing that you cant diagnose people with autism and avpd because its so hard to tell which confused me im currently turning in september i attend a sixth form college but that is literally the only place i go i have no remaining friends even though i really want close friends and people have tried to make friends with me i really avoid making friends though bc i feel so awkward and uncomfortable and trying to interact with people makes me so tired that i cant cope with it but its a constant struggle between feeling so lonely and really not wanting to talk to anyone i cant tell if this is specifically just autism or maybe avpd because i find a lot of autistic people dont actually avoid making friends rather just struggle to i cant go anywhere by myself ive never been to a shop alone before because of who i could have to speak to or if anything went wrong i feel sick at the idea of actually approaching people or speaking in a group i can rarely text i cant make phone calls and i dont like going out so i lose friends pretty quick because i essentially ghost them even when i dont mean to this is one of the main reasons i dont want to make new friends because i know im not a great friend in the future i plan on doing a job either part time or from home because i cant cope with interacting with people at school in my free periods i cant even stand sitting in the same room as others especially if theyre talking and i cant eat in front of others i feel like im on show these dont apply to my parents or my older sister if im with them these are easier originally i thought it was just being autistic or social anxiety or agoraphobia maybe but then i found out about avpd it definitely could just be autism but i feel so isolated and lonely but i dont want to be around anybody and i cant bare the thought of this being my entire life without any chance of it getting better could anyone maybe just tell me if you have any similar experiences or advice im just not sure what to do,3
i think that living inside your own head for too long makes the mind overwork itself httpspreviewredditocwpcogajpgwidthampformatpjpgampautowebpampvenabledampsdafffdddbfccaa,3
yeah let me tell you i might have nightmares about it my job lets me book working hours at any point of night or day so i naturally started booking weekends nobody comes on the weekends so i stopped preparing as much this weekend i went to my job without washing my hear and with home clothes i thought nobody is going to be there why did i do that ahhhhh not a long while after i arrived some of my collegues messages me that he wants me to work for minutes more that day because he left his laptop at a restaurant and he wants to get it back and hes coming to the office in minutes welp they got us but my collegue is not by boss right why does the title mention my boss then after my collegue arrived my boss dropped in xd he had a conversation with me about me working a little less past month h the limit at my company is he asked me if im doing ok and all i was able to think in my head is hes checking if im not liability and its one of the last straws soon im going to get fired i acutally always feared being fired the fact that i dropped out of uni and dont have a degree and this job pays a lot and everyone here is very noncontrolling makes it much worse i hate it when my mind just hyperfocuses on someones face and picks up their micro expressions then concludes they have no respect for me of course all of this is projection but relly it would be terrible if i lost this job i have no qualification and i only got here because i was recommended they have a policy that they always hire,3
im a male in my late s struggling to find traction in terms of being able to support myself recently ive only lasted a few weeks in a couple of different environments retail and warehouse i could do the actual jobs well enough but i get tripped up socially targeted by others and quit as a consequence ive had a difficult time throughout my adult years sustaining employment there have been times where i had long term prospects but they ultimately ended badly this has me in a pretty desperate mindset and ive decided to seek services for help finding something suitable what i want ideally is to have a space to work as independently as possible with low social expectations and predictable responsibilities ive been doing some gig work off and on which meets those requirements but that isnt a reliable income and you burn through gas my wife who makes ok income is being as patient and supportive as possible with me but we need a second income especially with living costs skyrocketing its crucial that i maintain a job so that i can keep the marriage stable and avoid homelessness which is what would likely happen if things fall apart we dont have kids so at least that isnt an issue at stake i should add that id never qualify for disability benefits given my education and work history what have others done to be able to support themselves long term what accommodations if any have you asked for in a job and finally has anyone significantly improved their selfimage and ability to handle the bs at work thanks for reading,3
hi everyone i want to share hope if you struggle with your mental health it took me about years but on my rd appeal where i went in front of the judge i was granted disability for my struggles with my mental health im so relieved so happy to finally have someone recognize me for what i deal with every day im thankful for all the years i hopped from job to job struggling for this helped increase my monthly payment amount it was worth it now now i can devote my full attention for healing and continue to better myself life is good feels good to share something positive for once,3
i definitely start to avoid people once i pick up on any small hint theyve started to dislike me but does anyone panic and start to avoid people if they show too much interest its like i cant tolerate more than a moderate level of attention directed towards me and i feel the need to disappear my therapist calls it dissociating from people,3
maybe im just pathetic but i feel like i need someone in my life for motivation i once had someone interested in me i think anyway lol and i was the most motivated i had ever been in my whole life if youre just alone its hard to say motivated imo i realize this is probably a flawed way of thinking and i know that you shouldnt rely on other people but i just feel like i need someone to give me that spark i feel like a hopeless romantic with zero romantic experience,3
it is often said that we avoid people unless we have full confidence on them i kind of confirm that i am more comfortable with my brother my mother my grandmother my cousin longtime friends etc would avpd then be a problem of trust in the others what do you think,3
dont you hate it when your message stays the last on a group chat so much attention i end up deleting my messages later on,3
f i moved back home to help my mom lessen the load thats on her with houseworks physical illness and a stressful season at work i wanted to get a job to aid the financial situation and to do as much housework as possible so that shed be relieved instead im avoiding all the job opportunities high on anxiety if i manage to land an interview rejecting the final offer in doubts of my ability to fulfill the employers expectations i cant imagine myself doing any of the jobs properly so basically i dont even try them and not only that ive drifted into depression again and have regular involuntary outbursts of crying even in front of her which of course puts even more pressure on her im a burden i live off of my parents not contributing due to my goddamn diminished self worth and avoidant patterns i have a therapist but the sessions are just once a week and of course it takes time to establish what were working on and to start changing the patterns its been a month now though and so far so avoidant and depressed im starting to get impatient because i dont want to be a burden any longer kinda wishing i never existed because if i unalive myself now its going to be just as much of a burden as if i stay alive avoidant,3
from what i understand of this disorder it would be difficultnear impossible to actually make them believe it is there any way i could is it worth trying regardless of the end result would it make them uncomfortable thank you for any responses,3
except for me like i think about suicide all of the time but had hiv scare and now think i will get paralized from vaccine shot since i have some weird symptoms i am ocd about it cant think about anything else,3
and when i see this i always wonder how long itll take them to feel disappointed in me and that i am completely different than what they thought about me from experience it usually takes weeks i dont know what vibes i give that some people just have this assumption that i must be some great person,3
usually im fine ive known ill be alone for years but sometimes the reality of it all comes crashing in i have so much love to give but il never get to experience it being wanted by another person being loved or being able to love the thing that of the population will experience i am denied access to because i happened to receive some shit luck from the universe how am i meant to accept that ive watched my friends who were just like me grow into capable adults experiencing relationships and new friendships while i havent moved at all im still the same stupid fucking kid i was at terrified of the world and all the people in it i am certain my brain wasnt built for life not in this world this disorder is fucking brutal its completely ruined my life all i wanted was to be normal but now im doomed to this loneliness for life and i cant ignore it every piece of media every time i leave the house theres love and couples everywhere and im not mad at them good for them im just struggling to accept the fact that everybody else gets to experience it and i happen to be one of the unlucky few that doesnt all thanks to avpd it hurts too fucking much the loneliness eats away at you all i asked was to feel wanted or validated by even human being but apparently even that is too much its not even about the sex at all i just want to feel someone elses warmth have somebody fall asleep on my chest feeling safe and secure in my presence trusting me enough to open up to eachother avpd is so horrible this loneliness will drive me to suicide im not far off as it is no human was meant to live like this i wouldnt even call it living sure you can survive with avpd but i dont think anyone can really say theyre really living if i knew i was gonna have to live with this shit id have killed myself in the fucking womb i wish my mum did she deserves better sry for the stupid drunk rant just had to vent it somewhere i hate myself so fucking much i never should have existed avpd is just too cruel how can this be my life how am i mean to be ok with that how am i meant to participate in society like every one else i wish i was dead i should be dead theres just no point struggling with the rest of my life if its going to be alone it already hurts this bad i will not let myself become an old even lonelier man looking back on a wasted life wishing id have just ended it earlier,3
but i feel so blocked off its funny how i complain about people who are unavailable to me as i am unavailable to everyone else especially my younger sibling i feel an overwhelming amount of guilt for how i treat him i feel like im repeating the cycle that i went through i completely avoid my younger brother and ive ruined our bond he doesnt even look at me and its my fault because i wouldnt even look at him im sure that hurt him it may not seem like it but i do try and care about him when he does look at me i try to make sure i smile i know how important that is for children when he asks for a hug ill give it even if i dont want to when he wants to show me something i try to ask questions and give him praise for his creative works i dont do this often enough though i avoid him because i dont have much to give kids in general make me feel uneasy because they need so much from their caretakers i feel inadequate that i cant give them that he reminds me of myself when i was younger and it makes me uncomfortable because i rejected that part myself a long time ago kids are authentically themselves until society molds them i can already see it happening with him hes quieter than he used to be he doesnt look people in the eyes he shuffles nervously he stutters he hides all things i used to do when i began rejecting myself i still do these things my authentic self is locked away shes still there but shes completely hidden its like i want to save my brother before he goes down the same route as me but i cant even save myself i just hope he can forgive me,3
do you guys ever have those days where you talk more to people laugh more and just be happier in general a day where you dont feel so dead so unacceptable i have those days at times and then it goes back to the way it was being scared of people my confidence dropping low again and feeling like a void of loneliness,3
ive been the quiet girl my entire life and i cannot tell you how many times during school and now work ive heard people tell me how quiet i am one of my teachers once called me the quietest girl theyd ever known and i would always get called a mute or asked if i ever talked and i cant explain why but every time someone says that to me or even pokes fun at me for it i have to hold back tears and just smile or lightly laugh it off i dont even know what to say when someone says that and it makes me feel even worse i would even go as far as to say it ruins my day because my brain just fixates on that and tells me theres something wrong with me over and over and its all i can think about i hate it i know im not normal i know im quiet i know i dont talk much so why does it hurt so much when someone tells me that,3
that is all,3
have you been in social situations thats actually going well then suddenly you get this wave of self awareness like oh yeah im me and im probably weirding everyone out so you step away to avoid any further cringing what is this and how do i get it to stop,3
i honestly feel like ive had a brain injury of some sort in like of conversations even with family members i simply have no idea what to say in a conversation my mind is a complete blank even in what would be a pretty standard easy conversation its like im paralysed or something i either mumble something only to retract it or just say nothing at all its awful and it makes me not want to talk to people even more because i dont want to put them in an awkward uncomfortable situation and make them think even worse of me im really pessimistic about ever making friendships or even mere acquaintances nowadays i literally have nothing to say i feel so socially inept that i just dont bother anymore it didnt used to be this way either i was confident talkative i had friends who id talk with long into the night even with people who werent my friends i could still hold a pretty decent conversation where did that go it feels like that part of me just left one day i dont know why or even when it did it just left im usually pretty fine about this i dont crave intimacy or friendship and am pretty content by myself but sometimes it just hits me how screwed i am a family member had surgery recently and i texted them to see how they were doing that resulted in them trying to have a conversation what with them being on bedrest and all but my responses were so bad they seemed to think so too because they stopped replying haha i cant blame them in the least for it too i wish it wasnt this way but i dont think theres much i can do about it either this blankness it feels like itll be there forever like some kind of inpenetrable fog muffling my thoughts blocking off any higher function dae experience this kind of thing does it get better with time how do you deal with it if at all,3
hello this is my first time posting on here im f and have never been in a relationship i have no friends when i was in high school i had one friend but we parted and went separate ways so the past couple years all i have been doing is listening to music with headphones on playing games watching films and daydreaming about love i sometimes go out for walks in nature i wish i could do fun stuff with someone one day i recently came across someone who im interested in weve talked and they seem nice we have similar interests but im afraid of speaking up and telling them how i feel it sucks having this because my negative self talk wins and i run away from people sigh this is hard,3
im very worried about my brother and not sure how to help him so ive been doing research and a lot of the characteristics of avpd seem to match hes my roommate and he hasnt worked in years and just stays home all day on his computer the majority of his time and will not get a job however his personality is very outgoing and hes like the life of the party when we he is out he just doesnt want to do anything and my parents said he has been like this since he was a kid im pretty sure he has expressed he feels like he wasnt good enough since he was a kid hes dyslexic so he was never able to get good grades and had to try lots of different schools etc i dont know how to help him because he says hes fine and doesnt open up to anyone so i really have no idea whats going on in his head,3
went through my facebook conversations from years ago today and i got so emotional i used to speak to so many people and i sounded so neurotypical a lot of the messages from these ppl were rlly sweet i started crying bc i couldnt believe there was a time when people actually loved me im so used to people being disgusted repulsed by me like no one ive met in the past few years has actually liked me i used to be real i had hopes dreams stories to share i was physically attractive and moderately smart it all went downhill when i moved abroad for college ive always struggled socially so when i realized that i didnt have to talk to ppl to survive i isolated myself years later and im a completely different person there is nothing inside me im empty just a lifeless being waiting for death i dont recognize the girl that wrote those texts my cognitive abilities have significantly declined i used to write so well and now i cant even string a coherent sentence together im so negative and hateful i have zero empathy i cannot carry a conversation anymore im constantly disassociated from reality i havent had friends in years the only people i talk to are my parents and my grandma id to anything to go back in time and fix it all that girl didnt deserve what i did to her,3
its helping me resolve my avoidant characteristics its helping me fight off peoples neuroticism and hystericism,3
when you have avpd you avoid forming relationships ighttherefore most of us prefer living like hermits the point i am trying to make is is there anyone else who notice that they cant carry even simplest chit chatswhen someone tries to talk to me and asks anything i try my best to come up with an answer but it feels like there is some sort of static in my head the white noise i guess its because i heavily prefer my fantasies over real life,3
two weeks ago i wouldve sworn i had avpd but i think maybe i just wasnt trying hard enough to talk to people all these years like part of me was scared so i gave up because now i am actually trying and it is getting easier and im forcing myself to talk and trying to be open with people and yes its hard as fuck and i still have social anxiety but i am actually doing it thoughts would it be a lot harder if i had avpd its still hard but the thing is it gets easier every time i talk to someone and i was homeschooled and also had no social contact outside my family for like months so i have a lot of inexperience,3
somewhat recently someone at work who saw i was very avoidant actually decided to talk to me and encourage me to get more connected to people i took some of it to heart and did just that even if it was just online i had some nice little projects going on met some great people but then everything just went sideways in my life all at once and now im slipping back into being almost entirely invisible again and i dont want to be but it feels like all i have to offer now because of it is negativity right now in a nutshell a lot of family stuff went down and i even am now having a technical problem with my music project i cant find out the issue of and im just spending more and more money trying to fix it the one thing i found that i enjoy doing and was finally making progress with completely over the course of a single night went under for me i swear its like im cursed everything i love turns to crap and any good times i have in life are always immediately at some point halted by complete tragic bs it never ends and i just retreat back into myself again repeating all of the old cycles is there anyone that can relate i dont expect any solutions cause i dont even think there is any besides just doing my thing and moving on,3
how do you deal with casually dating got out of an long term relationship a few months ago wasnt looking for anything serious and just dating for fun and then the man i was dating told me he was hitting it off with his ex gf again and i started to spiral badly down the im not good enough hole although im not even looking for a serious relationship sometimes its difficult to differentiate between normal human experience and my disorder in terms of what are socially expected feelings or behaviors in these kind of situations,3
having it posting seeing what other people are up to etc reddit doesnt count im referencing instagram facebook etc where you have to put public information about yourself in there,3
hello everyone lurker for a small while now im m im in the process of getting diagnosed cause my life is shit and i continually fail at anything and have no friends and never had a romantic relationship everything points to avpd according to the psychiatric place im being diagnosed in so i figured id check out the sub some time ago i resonate with a lot of people in here so i felt like id chip in a bit ive essentially lived in complete isolation for months now except to buy groceries on sick leave from my vocational school only very rarely seeing family in that time all social interaction is through online games not that this has ever really been much different which i do think help ground me a bit more in reality i know that some of you guys have gone years without even that and im sorry to hear it i want to get better finish my education have one or two friends a roma tic relationship and a job but life is fucking hard and most of the time it feels like a fact that none of it will ever happen seriously fuck living like this im getting a little hope from knowing more about avpd and that i most likely am about to be diagnosed so i can get help but even still ive had times today where i just feel like human waste that shouldnt be allowed to exist im scared of getting hurt so ive never attempted suicide even though ive fantasized about it a lot i also couldnt bring myself to do anything like it because of my family sometimes theyre all that holds me from crossing my fear anyways onto more nondeath related shit earlier i ordered food and have put a note to the delivery driver to just ring the doorbell and place it on the mat i really hope they got the note cause i look fucking terrible and struggle with taking regular baths besides my apartment looks so bad id rather not have anyone look inside so yeah kinda just hope to be able to pick up my food in peace thats all i have for today besides all the shit everyone here struggles with i wish you the best possible day,3

ive spent my whole life avoiding social situations that cause discomfort i feel for me personally the end result has been not feeling a sense of fulfillment this life is so short and we have to make the absolute best of it we can while we are able to but i let everything fall by the wayside i let my avoidance control me and continue to fail to accomplish anything or hold fulfilling relationships even if i miraculously get it under control ill still have all of these years i spent in isolation doing nothing of value i fear that on my deathbed ill be alone looking back on my life in regret does anybody else feel this that their time has been somewhat robbed by avpd i know it falls on me to make the change and that i cant play the victim but the regret is still there,3
being ugly has made me feel like a fucking robot im sooo fucking jealous of everyone everywhere everyone at my job has these personalities that they just express without thinking of how the other person will perceive them they crack lame jokes witty jokes and everyone laughs and accepts it and they all act like theyre brothers and sisters of course im the fucking outcast who is quiet all the time and doesnt say anything but robotic one liners because i feek like thats all i can do anytime ive tried being funny and more comfortable i got shot down so many times people would say who tf says that shut up or just flat out ignore me opposed to how they laugh with each other and and add on to each others jokes i feel like i have to constantly watch what i say every fucking time im talking to anyone people have said kobes weird hes too quiet hes a loner but like im only quiet cause i feel like people will consider me lame and annoying if i try expressing myself and talking to them its not fair no one else has these fears and im essentially trapped in my brain locked out from making any meaningful connections the worst part is i dont even think this is fixable its been this way for basically my whole life like whenever i tried to take a leap and express myself ive mostly been shot down and looked at like i was special needs and its dehumanizing and isolating i dont know what tf to do im so sick of being cursed to ugliness and this sub i just want to live my fucking life and connect with people i feel like when youre ugly youre not allowed to really express yourself and joke like everyone else because people will automatically take offense to it so unfortunately even tho i want to connect with people i stay to myself cause i feel like im unbearably boring and awkward and like people dont like me and would rather not talk to me soo fuck,3
its the one thing that drives me insane i am sick of being surrounded by adults who are an emotional burden on me i dont mind material burdens but emotional ones they scare me to death,3
i wonder if this applies to you guys as well because honestly this may just be my quirk i noticed that i dont contribute much to conversations because i have this weird fear of accidentally offending or hurting the people im talking to its like walking on eggshells i overthink everything a thousand times before actually saying it its also why i shy away from relationships i dont want my partner to be unhappy because of me so i dont even try,3
i met a girl online in november and we tried to hit it off it was a sort of long distance relationship since she lives about an hours drive from me not critical but we dont have a car neither of us or days off to see eachother too often in fact weve never met on new years eve she was attacked by a mutual acquaintance and she got bummed out and always kept apologizing when she thought she offended me i felt so bad every time i broke up a few days ago i dont know if you can really call it a break up since we never even met yet because i felt like garbage and i didnt want her to depend on me since i dont even know what to do to take care of myself i didnt even have the courage to hear her afterwards i apologized in advance in my last message to her and archived and silenced her chat before she could even text me back i pat me on the back pls,3

as someone with a speech impediment childhood apraxia of speech and currently undiagnosed avpd along with selective mutism its frustrating that this whole society seems to be based off social interaction im almost and realized that i should be looking for a temporary job by then so im not a complete failure living in their parents house no offense to anyone who does i set high standards for myself i see everyone else around my age and younger getting the easiest jobs where they literally just have to sit at a cash register all day and they get some good money its frustrating me to my core as i can never get an easy job like them as i cant handle social interaction or talking i try to look for alternative jobs but every single one of them pops up with requires excellent communication skills or verbal communication required even working as a stocker or in a kitchen apparently requires communication for the life of me i can not communicate well with people as i automatically freeze up and go into panic mode inside even at the small school i volunteer at i can barely even force out a word i just do my job silently before leaving they probably are only letting me help out of pity i even considered being a police officer for a while until i realized that you needed communication for that too im more fucking scared of talking to people then of tackling down murders today my girlfriend was looking for tutoring jobs and i just cried seeing how easy it is for her and everyone else not having to even care about social interaction i hate living in this world thats built around people who can talk,3

after having gotten in trouble at work for showing up late and being tired at work multiple times now and realizing that while im in training ive mostly been given boring tasks where i learn nothing and this wont change anytime soon ive now not shown up to work and ghosted everybody from work two days straight my country has decent labour laws regarding trainees so they probably wont attempt to fire me yet but im definitely getting closer and closer to being in danger i need to finish this training because i wanna go to university which i cant otherwise im and need to move forward in life sometime to get to a place where i can actually do something interesting for a living or im gonna go crazy i work an office job how do you guys deal with workplace issues what has worked for you help,3
so there are beliefs that avpd is caused by neglect of parents or caretakers and then when you grow up you realize you have this and even this disorder itself is neglected so individuals having this disorder are basically neglected in every way for their entire life from parents neglecting them to society neglecting their disorder,3
my life was normal until my father died at and my mom left at i experienced childhood trauma physical abuse emotional abuse verbal abuse and neglect by the people that raised me not only that i come from a strict religious immigrant family so along with all those issues i was never allowed to leave the house much my family also never went out and did anything and they also never showed me any love or affection this was my life growing up until i finally moved out at ive since been doing better for myself as ive graduated college and have a career now but the damage was so severe that i dont think ill ever fully recover my upbringing made me lonely that i never had many friends verbal abuse made me mute and unable to talk back so i cant talk with cluttering i do not have much confidence or self esteem i still do this day dont have many friends or much of a social life i also have a hard time dating and at still have not hooked up with a girl outside is kissing and making out i look at my life and the look at everyone else they all had loving caring parents siblings to play with and grew up with all the love and compassion in the world they have many friends they have boyfriends they have girlfriends they dont have speech issues etc they just seem to be able to live life normally unlike me i did nothing wrong to deserve the things that happened to me as a kid as all of it out of out my control but sometimes i ask myself why me just why i was given only one life on this planet why did my life go like this why does everyone else get love and compassion while i got nothing but misery,3

i got rejected recently and it caused me to spiral really badly my brain went straight into see i knew you werent good enough ofc youre not their type ofc they only wanted you for your body nobody will want you romantically it got so bad that i started having physical pains i had to literally interrupt that mean voice and say woah youre hurting yourself and you need to stop it takes practice but its very important to interrupt that shitty inner critic its going to look for any proof that youre not good enough and you have to challenge it so i reminded myself hey maybe this person genuinely meant it when they said theyre not ready for a relationship i had to tell myself maybe they have their own emotional blocks thats stopping them and i had to refer to my fav quote of all time when it comes to rejection you can be the ripest peach and theres always someone that just doesnt like peaches please if youre able to create that positive voice that challenges negative thoughts its not a cure ofc but over time you will start to have more compassion for yourself and your inherent value,3
me again having another midlife crisis i cant function in life i have adhd and may have a bunch of other problems so i dont know if its related to avpd or not i forgot to take my thyroid hormone two days straight and i also didnt buy my antidepressants for some stupid reason when i finally went to buy them they were out of stock so yesterday i was super sad and vulnerable and also feeling physically drained like was going to pass out then came the anxiety and crying today thanks to my mom i bought my life numbing drugs after being scolded like a kid and im having another melt down i dont know who i am anymore am i this mess of a person or is it the drugs when im ok am i really ok i feel so incompetent so stupid so weak i cant take care of myself my house is messy even though i try every single day to make it beautiful i have no job and zero courage or motivation to get one no independence i feel so scared of everything of being alone in the end and dying alone and knowing my life depends on me taking the thyroid hormones doesnt help i need people so much but im terrified to reach out and be rejected im afraid my husband will leave me even though he is super caring and loving im afraid once people see the black hole in my chest theyll run away i shouldnt need another human being like this since im in my s already dont even know where im going with this post i just feel like life is incredibly hard for me but only in my head i have it easy and im struggling to survive and maybe itll always be like this because of avpd,3

i want to be able to talk to someone deeply about my avoidance and other issues i cant stand keeping it all inside me anymore but i feel like once i start talking about these things to anyone i just come across as victimizing myself im slowly losing connections day by day but even when indirectly called out for it by friends or family i still cant find the courage to do anything about it i know im capable of developing strong relationships given enough time but the problem is most people dont have that patience or theyre unable to reason with my pov,3
i told someone how i truly felt about them i knew i wasnt going to get the results i wanted but their reply was sweet and gentle and did not come across as complete rejection i walked away from the conversation in no more pain than i was in when i started it i can at least live knowing that i didnt let my anxiety keep my from taking the chance i dont think anything will change between us as a result of the conversation which is good as they are a good friend of mine and i would hate to lose that life has been weird lately i have discussed my feelings about this person with someone else which is something i wouldnt have ever thought i could do i think that has helped me gather the strength to talk to the other person directly whatever works right,3
i think todays the first day i truly felt invisible and im honestly glad it was my first inperson class in a while and required discussion participation for a grade but all i had to say was one sentence and then i could happily mind my own business its incredibly relieving to just do your own thing not wonder about what others think of you and not be expected to be a vital member of the class thats why its so important to learn about yourself to be comfortable in your own skin to the point where you feel that you dont have to justify being yourself,3
does anyone else really love and care for those around you but feel physically incapable of expressing it not just verbally but by interacting with them at all ill go to family events and think how much i love everyone there but am too anxious to join in on talking to people i feel like people think i dont like them when that couldnt be further from the truth im so uncomfortable and embarrassed by expressing affection itself too its like theres this block in my head that prevents me from getting the words out this is why i know id be incapable of a romantic relationship never had one these things are a crucial part of them but im incapable of doing them,3
anyone have those they are especially dangerous because they will pass their emotional burdens onto you when youre still a child thereby hindering your own emotional development and making it harder for you to address the emotional needs of other people like youre supposed to be able to do as adults,3
the last time my only friend was in a terribly dark place i left her messages unread for two days and when i finally felt like i could actually handle responding i could barely come up with two pathetic fucking sentences i appreciate that she left it on read and hasnt brought it up again instead of telling me just how absolutely shitty and unhelpful i was now shes tweeting about feeling stranded on a desserted island by myself less than an hour ago and i feel like such a selfish disgusting piece of shit but i dont know how to comfort her or be there for her at all bc i dont feel like i can handle it i can hardly handle my own bullshit i cant be of any help i cant even just listen and be a shoulder to cry on good enough bc im too much of a coward i think i just deserve to be alone to rot im not worthy of connections or relationships theyre meant to be twosided and i cant hold up my end up the bargain i hope i die alone so i stop hurting people,3
i have been feeling okay for quite a while now im hyperfocusing on things that make me happy so my brain is just too busy to think about negative things however i know for a fact my avpd gets significantly worse when my period is approaching my mood plummets entirely i start becoming really mistrustful of other peoples intentions i isolate and i completely lose hope in the future theres also a really important exam coming up soon and i really want to have of my head in the game rather than worrying about how much of a terrible failure i am and how everyone actually pretends to tolerate me but would rather have me gone from their lives any advice from anyone who has a good strategy with dealing with pms and avpd at the same time,3
hello im a teenager that needs to go to school my scholar first day of the year is close got no friends its the school i studied at my whole life i was too afraid to move to a different one its my last year of school first year alone my friend had to go everyone smh knows me as the weird quiet nerd lonely and more like asocial kid its been a year since i got diagnosed with that thing i made so much sense i thought i could finally move on and magically turn very social and all wrong i didnt what to be by my self i feel so awkward but i am scared of people omg any advice i feel like i have nothing else to do but to say no word all day blame myself isolate much more i like to study i hate school i cant socialize no matter what at least say good morning,3
for as long as i can remember all my friendships have been due to me taking the initiative asking the other person about their life and making plans if i stop doing this i stop having friends i wonder what this says about me the only thing that comes to mind when facing this fact is am i that reprehensible and i know that sounds like i am expecting things of people but isnt a friendship supposed to be a way street i feel so crushingly lonely when i think about all this theres this video from kurzgesagt about loneliness and in that they say that the feeling of loneliness has the evolutionary purpose of saving you from the threat of being excluded from the tribe if these were the days when humans lived in tribes i would basically be deemed to not be worthy of survival every friendship that starts has so much at stake for me i cant face another onesided thing its such a slap in the face like im not worth knowing which is why i avoid investing myself in anything nowadays these strings of continuous unreciprocated experiences have left me incapable of taking care of myself everything i do for myself feels not worth doing even talking about myself feels like a waste of time if i try so hard to be part of the world and it rejects me why should i care to survive at all,3

so yeah i did it or atleast i am doing it i dontt know what will happen next it was always a distant dream of mine to just leave everything behind maybe you can relate i quit my job and my appartment i left my cozy first world country with a one way ticket to india currently i am touring rajestan on a motorcycle the only contact to my old life is my family even though i would like to cut contact i cant bring myself to do it it would break my mothers heart i eat way too much seriously the food is amazing and get stared and begged at alot because i am a western guy some days i dont leave my hotel room other days i drive km on busy roads you probably know this feeling the ambivalence is killing me i love being alone but at the same time i miss not being alone and often i think doing this was a big mistake the whole experience is meh and because i dont know where to go or what to do planning anything is impossible right now i have k in savings but what for the only thing i always hear in my head is wherever you go there you are and atleast thats true thanks for reading if you have any questions feel free to ask advice is also greatly appreciated,3
i just received an email with an answer and i started freaking out and writing this message in order to delay my opening it could that be considered a symptom lol now seriously ive never even spoken about this out loud with anyone and im freaking out right now will i be able to go get tested its so silly but im afraid i will only have regular anxiety and ill be embarrassed about making a whole deal about it anyway ill put on some relaxing music and open it at some point edit so theyre sending me a phone number to get in touch with them like seriously a voice call i cannot edit it just occurred to me what if its a test already i doubt it but im really surprised they asked a possible avpd person to make a phone call edit i just texted this woman and told her if you dont mind its more comfortable for me to speak this way then she texted me back im on the subway now ill call you asap facepalm i really need help but im starting to regret it right now edit more than a day later they called me and i didnt pick it up i am bothered by the fact that they should be more sensitive considering theyre specialised in these kinds of disorders immediately afterwards they texted me and i thought they would have realised and would communicate by text but the text said you have a missed call from me tell me when youre available sigh i think ill try to tell my current therapist after all because it gives me less anxiety than changing,3
im a sophomore in college and ive totally given up on making friends my issue isnt with finding a group to fit in with but rather just surviving my classes all my courses this semester have a large amount of group and partner work and lately ive been skipping or running out of class to avoid it does anyone have any tips for getting through these interactions im absolutely terrified of people my age due to unpleasant experiences in elementary and middle school i dont want this to ruin my grades,3
this is almost like a cosmic joke this course is definition of criticism working sleepless nights on projects overthinking of the negative reviews is constant nightmare and im excelling the art of escapism im and this is the third fucking time i discontinued college thrice i didnt know what was wrong with me i was always avoidant from before i even had the memory of it but i thought that was just my normal nature i just discovered that i have avpd from the recurring symptoms it is destroying my life its progressing on the path to hell it all makes sense now my choices my running away the pattern is embedded deep into my subconscious i feel hopeless and suicidal i have never been to therapy havent talked about it to anyone yet my family might be supportive although none of us has ever been to therapy before im hanging onto this little hope that i could do better with professional help its not too late should i tell them or not idk that being said guys has anyone been to therapy or something that has seen improvements for the sake of life,3
ive been asked to self refer to a network of group therapy i think it will be a good way to meet others who have this disorder but at the same time i am terrified especially about speaking publicly and opening up to a group of people has any here ever tried it or are you currently in a group therapy id love to hear your experiences thank you,3
anybody else i find i get very jealous when others share my same interests yea i know it sounds like im an asshole this feeling has been stuck with me since i was little like when someone mentions they have the same interest i immediately feel worthless its like wow okay who needs me nobody i dont stand a chance or someone posts about it and a bunch of other people are also into it i feel so bland and competitive and ready to give up they know more than me theyre better than me im not cool or special they will succeed and i wont the other day i saw a post which mentioned my future career idea which was somewhat uncommon k likes i felt like giving up because i just feel so small and useless now i dont know how to describe it really i know this probably sounds like im looking too far into it edit thank u for the comments glad to know im not alone in this feeling and thank u for the advice some of u gave,3
if its two different disorders there should be someone who is avpd without sad although many people have both disorders or are these just different aspects of same thing,3
httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvoygdjtfscihttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvoygdjtfsci was just watching this classic again the other day poor adrian what do you guys think is this avpd,3
it seems like every time i try interacting with someone it just gets ignored no matter what even if i ask questions as to prompt a reply its like i dont exist or nothing i say is of enough value to pay attention to i dont get what im doing so wrong,3
im not grossly unhealthy but one of the most unfit person alive can barely do a push up type bad ive tried working out thrice but i kept quitting one week in due to the embarrassment of trying to improve i also hated to be reminded that im weak which floods my mind whenever i do an exercise but i was wondering did working out manage to help anyone should i try again or just give up,3
i have been hiding from people for so long even when i was going to school i was finding ways to hide from the world i got sad again and randomly searched avoidance on youtube and one video that popped up was from this guy called dr k i guess hes a popular mental health streamer on twitch and a psychiatrist who works at harvard i dont really play video games anymore but i do think i have an internet addiction back in the day i definitely used video games as a crutch and it prevented me from being outside and meeting people so i do relate to those who have gaming addiction avoidance a lot of the points he was making in his videos resonated with me he talked about how a lot of gamers are actually fairly smart now part of this felt like he was blowing smoke up his audiences ass but on the other hand i can see a lot of introverted smart but shy types gravitating towards games a lot of the people i knew growing up who gamed were pretty smart people even the lazy ones who never amounted to anything in life now the part that i wanted to go over was the avoidance aspect of life he mentioned how a lot of these gaming addicts are told they are smart and find school to be fairly easy early in their life so they dont really struggle early in life but later as they get older they lack the necessary abilities to succeed their selfconscious nature makes them wilt under the pressure of being judged anything that makes them appear as not intelligent immediately triggers avoidance what a lot of these people dont understand is that they need to gain experience not intelligence in order to succeed i looked up dr ks history and it seems like he was struggling college student with a video game addiction and dropped out of school briefly to join some monastery in india he came back and succeeded and went to medical school and became a psychiatrist so i guess hes proof that fighting avoidance works but what do people who have wasted so much of their life and are already able to do he had the luxury of taking a dramatic step when he was and able to come back and succeed not to mention that he is obviously capable of putting himself out there again this could be due to experience and desensitizing himself but how many of us would even be able to have the courage to pack our bags and go to a monetary for someone like me my mind is a confusing mess that a step like that would be met with a million different excuses to avoid doing that i find that a lot of success stories ignore that the people who were struggling were not as extreme as a lot of people like myself,3
it was awful i hated it and i am so afraid of going in there again i dont want to go much into details but the whole day i kept forgetting every fucking thing i was told i kept zoning out asking a lot of questions a lot of times the same kind of questions again and again being slow because how much i was overwhelmed i kept telling myself that i am giving it my best its my first day and no one should expect me being immediately perfect in this but it didnt really help i needed to do a lot of multitasking to keep my eye on multiple things but it seemed that i just couldnt focus in the end i felt extremely inferior to all my coworkers whenever some of them would remind me that i was forgetting somethingdoing something wrongetc i felt so attacked crushed judged at some point i even nearly cried but i could suppress it god i hate this shit i am aware that of those thoughts i have are completely inadequate and irrational i am certain that they were just trying to help and guide me since i am new in there but why doesnt it help with feeling less worthless,3
i hate it i just want to enjoy life,3
just a quick example of what i mean sometimes youre just talking to a person and youre getting along great and youre just in that moment and youre enjoying it in its isolation and you think wow you now what maybe things are fine and that person says something that just snaps you right back its not necessarily political but one example was a classmate im getting along fine with who is a woman but is heavily against feminism and once a month goes on a rant about it and it makes me just so exhausted and disinterested in pursuing that friendship the other is my brother whos like oh im fine with gay people but then yesterday joked about how only the women that look like men are real lesbians i see the normal looking women in lesbian relationships as just experimenting its so fucking exhausting and isolating and i live in a fucking racist homophobic shithole of a country to begin with and any time i meet at least somewhat of an openminded person they still have that one thread of fascism they refuse to let go of and god its fucking hard not to see this whole country as a country of neo nazis no matter how much i try to focus on the positives all i ever see is people in prorussian protest or people attacking alternative bars or spraying neonazi symbols on city walls its endlessly fucking depressing and any time i complain about it to people they all say oh dont look at it like that not everybody acts or thinks the way they think but its so hard not to it feels dishonest and fake not to and i already have trobules with being social and opening up to people and now theres always this layer of oh well i gotta be cautious with what i say about what i think because any person could hold back some fascistic views with men especially the men here are a whole different kind of intolerant pigs its so bad that im constantly undervaluing my own opinions and thoughts it fucking sucks i never verbalize what i think or feel because this whole culture is built on constant arguments and belittlings and wanting to prove yourself right that it gets so exhausting to socialize and i want to socialize i desperataely want a friendgroup and a circle of people im comfortable with because i have none of that right now and it sucks because i cant even break out of that caution to even begin to start looking for people and its so hard not to filter people through an ideological filter because thats always what it boils down to i dont want to care this much i want to just fuck off the world and just be me and i cant i want people i dont want to want people its so fucking lonely,3
so i got a job and im super anxious and cant stop crying i start on tuesday or wednesday and im already nervous for that day to come i feel a huge fear cant quite point out what the fear is but something of it is probably the social interaction i wish something terrible happens to me so i can avoid the first day of work what should i do i really want to ghost the manboss and just wanna stay home but my family really wants me to get a job,3

tldr my therapist says labels might be helpfulempowering for some but might have a negative effect on others theres debates about this in the mental health community it is in fact harmful for me so i have decided to stop seeking diagnosis for now recently my therapist told me how mental health labels might help some but have a negative effect on some this discussion started when i requested a written diagnosis from her in my case after discussing labels with her i was able to come to the conclusion that i tend to dehumanise myself because of the label i treat myself as diseased or nuisance and often feel bad for not being as good as normal people theres a whole debate even in the mental health community about labels and how sometimes mental health professionals might misuse it so for now ive stopped seeking out a diagnosis but what about you do you think the avpd label helps you view pollhttpswwwredditcompollow,3
excerpt from an article about sad and avpd,3
so ive noticed that when i contemplate my inevitable death i feel strange i can think about if i die tomorrow the next day or amy other time but when i remind myself that it is virtually impossible for me to live past say ish it feels different i think about how nothing i do will ever prevent me from dying and really it is the only time i feel sohuman i feel small and frankly insignificant because nothing i ever do will amount to anything in the face of eternity a hundred years after i die what should i care id be dead so whatever i do will only matter to others if it even reaches that far besides by that point whatever hopes i had that my actions benefited someone is dead alongside me what im getting at is im nothing more than a collection of matter that gets some pointless shot at doing something for myself and the other matter blobs around me it feels very human to me that feeling of nigh nothingness that is why id consider myself religious because its the voice inside that tells me something as pointless as me is seen and cared about and that the things that i do will matter for the rest of eternity i know it sounds crazy and people have told me repeatedly that im stupid for believing in anything but what else do i have ive gotten as close to the edge as i could before just to see if i would do it clearly i didnt but if i didnt have some hope that my faith is worth it well you know anyways what im getting at is that im religious because it makes me feel wanted like i have a purpose even if its not entirely clear to me or anyone else really i hope yall have good coping mechanisms too because i can take a good guess at what my life would look like if i didnt have my faith and for those of you who were hurt in some way because of someones religion im truly sorry that you had to go through that nobody should have to experience that and i hope you dont think any less of me for my faith i wouldnt try to hurt someone just because they disagree with me and i dont get to choose how you live your life at the end of the day i do sincerely hope yall are doing okay,3
looking for sum to talk about like our feelings n shit and maybe one day flash bits of our despicable core idk could be pretty sweet i think ima drug addict with avpd so its kinda hard to do that irl and dont worry about if u ghost me i get its not personal editim edit now im insecure that flash bits might be interpreted as sexually i just meant like itd be cool to share things about self that might come with fears of rejectionhurting others,3
if i told someone i was years old and never had a romantic relationship in my life and have no friends at the moment theyd run for the hills and i dont blame them thats a giant red flag and nobody even the most empathetic people want to stick around to find out the reason for that im like an alien in the eyes of most people how can somebody relate to not doing anything meaningful their lives and having the drive and motivation of a rock most people want to strive for something grand im just content having my basic needs met if someone would even give a freak like me a chance there would be no way theyd be able to tolerate me for too long as a guy im sure the way i act is purely pathetic and cowardly to most woman out there if she doesnt understand my mental illness shell see me as not a real man because im so sensitive and anxious all the time about trivial things that most people dont even think about sorry about the pity post my family thinks one of my new years goals should be to finally get a girlfriend easier said than done i really dont think anyone would tolerate me and i wouldnt want to burden someone with myself im convinced that id only be able to be with someone who has avpd or sad however destructive that relationship that may be,3

i find i have many similarities here im wondering what does love look like for you how do you give it and how would you like to receive it,3
i recently found out that i have been avoiding people and things because of fear of shame and rejections mostly it has to be fair affected many areas of my life almost every single popular post in this sub all the behaviors from reading it here and other mental health sites i find super specific to me it all just clicked in my brain and ever since then ive been purposefully doing the very things that i know for a fact i have more than a significant chance of getting rejected or embarrassed it feels like im trying to move a pillar from my chest and sometimes i just wanna die but im determined i had one major moment of rejection today and i felt awful one of the worst feelings but i kept reminding myself that this is the way towards betterment facing my fears is the only way to not be afraid of it anymore i have been feeling very uneasy but also experiencing a lot of new scenarios and feelings so to speak im also very secretive and dont share a lot the purpose of this post is also to share my vulnerability with you all from my main reddit account in the past i wouldve done it with an alt i hope anyone struggling with this find some strength from this that would make me genuinely happy also know that you can also get out of this one small step for you and me one giant leap towards betterment,3

i usually talk to myself in my thoughts a lot i tried to stop doing it for few minutes and it was like i was hurting my brain but it was also kind of freeing like i didnt think about anything and my mind was empty but i think i will need to exercise this a lot more and kind of get used to it i think having these stupid dialogues that i have are making me depressed and mad i realized that i can stop these monologues if i want i am just very used to having them,3

if its that easy i wouldnt be missing school for months it fucking sucks that everyone is undermining everything we are going through they dont realize how this affects our literal lives they dont see how severe this is just because they cant see our disorder when will the time come where people take mental health seriously if this was a physical disorder this wouldve been treated a long time ago the school doesnt even take my situation seriously they are basically telling me to get over it they are so fucking lucky they dont get to experience what we go through its not like we asked for this fuck i hate people so much literally the only people who sympathize with us is those who have avpd too literally only the community itself it also doesnt help that my country is fucking nuts and religious and dont believe in mental health if i asked for help authorities would literally tell me to just pray and read the fucking bible fuck this country fuck people fuck everyone who doesnt take mental health seriously,3

really dont know what to think anymore my life is basically that of an hikikomori with no job or future its an infinite cycle of me craving social interactions and me searching ways to push away from me those that try to bond,3
we walked in the park for like an entire day then the next day watched a movie we kissed which was my first time doing that cool but it turned out she wasnt as into me as i was her so its over all for the best im feeling so positive about it it was painful for the first couple days after no lie but now i feel great i was so worried that i wouldnt be able to make a move sexually but i did it it was awkward as hell obviously but i did it i was bold as fuck and it was really no big deal i saw her again the other day and it was totally cool no hard feelings i finally feel like a real living human being its like ive been set free in a major way only a year after i asked out the first person haha feels like a lifetime ago i never thought id actually get here and im so grateful that i did and i have so much time ahead of me im only i used to look at the future and see only dread and misery but now i see hope and promise thank you thank you,3
i used to be anxious about being around strangers but now i dont really care as much but i always get way more anxious at the thought of meeting people i do know and i try to avoid them as much as i can i dont even see any value in forming friendshipsrelationships anymore i try open up as little as possible to people the more i get to know them the more i try to avoid them i fear that friendships come with unrealistic expectations and that as people get to know me theyll realise that im weird and will gradually dislike me and maybe try to make me feel guilty for not meeting their expectations i also dont want to become dependent on other people cos it seems like most friends only seem to care about you when it suits them i just think most friendships are fake and overrated,3
at my core i feel gone like something was never placed there im years old i will try to explain it as numb or not there i dont feel like there is something on the inside of my mind looking for people who relate or any support do you think it has a name its not really depression imo,3
i lived in a place with very expensive rent i tried living with my family but basically over the last two days everything fell apart some of it is technically my fault but more avpd i tried living in supported housing but always had a roommate who wouldnt let me sleep almost got into having my own room but it fell apart before that this is pretty much crazy but hopefully it will work out im on disability so im trying to live somewhere i can get a cheap apartment its possible i can get a job to make the budget issues easier for living in unhealthy situations i couldnt hold down a job im at least hoping thats the reason things with my family were ok before but after covid there was like an explosion of bad luck going around somehow i was used as a scapegoat basically scared but also my life was going in a vicious cycle i had to change something major,3
mostly i wish i could just skip all the scary beginning stuff of getting to know someone i like having friends but im terrified of trying to make new ones i like socializing but only when its not terrifying ive never been in a relationship but it seems nice to have someone to be there for you at the end of the day i only have my family but they all have their own lives and their own immediate families i just wish that i had someone outside of my family i wish i had someone that liked similar things and that i could go do stuff with or someone to eat dinner with most days i just wish i wasnt so scared of trying to get the things that i want it feels like a pity party kind of night,3
i hate my face and the fact that people can see me ive been told i have a decent looking face and good features but it doesnt matter my own mental image of myself is still awful i think of myself like im deformed or have severe facial scarring or something its like an inherent and irrational feeling of shame and guilt a constant voice in my head telling me to hide my face that other people will judge me or laugh at me for how bad i look when everybody had to wear face masks i felt great i was a little more confident going into public spaces and talking to people because i knew they couldnt see my face and what i looked like it felt like a weight lifted off my shoulders now nobody wears them though so i generally wear a hood or hat whenever i leave the house it just makes me feel much more comfortable i think thats also why eye contact is so difficult because when theyre staring into your eyes it feels like theyre looking right at you judging you theyre able to see your whole face idk why i even wrote this just wondered if anyone else feels the same even though its totally irrational and theres no reason to i just cant get rid of the feeling of hating everything about myself feeling ashamed of it all though mainly my face,3

first of all im sorry for this post i dont want to offend anyone or adorn myself with words that im not entitled to after reading many of your posts and doing some research myself i fear that i might also have avpd or at least have very similar symptoms my problem how do i find out if im completely delusional or if there might actually be something to it if i just ask my therapist how do i know i dont have avpd it may come across as extremely knowitall and pushy aside from that i have many questions and concerns what if i was misdiagnosed because i misdescribed my problems im really sorry to write in this subreddit its just that i just panicked again because of an incident thanks for reading i really appreciate it,3
last year i was diagnosed with avpd by a psychiatrist today i was diagnosed as autistic after a year process of multiple assessments culminating in a hour assessment today with clinic psychiatrists and an autism nurse now i dont know if i am just autistic or if i have avpd too wondered if anyone here has had both diagnoses,3
i have this deep longing to be loved by someone who also has avpd like me who knows and understands so incredibly well about what its like to be me because we have very similar if not even the same upbringing and experiences that led to us being the people we are today by this i mean i always think about whether ill ever meet and get to love and be loved by someone that not only shares the same thoughts and feelings about most things because relationship compatibility but also shares the same traumas i even maladaptive daydream and have intimate conversations with this nonexistent person about my life and they always meet it with patience and understanding because theyre genuinely a good person and they also know firsthand what i am talking about and how i feel i dont think i would ever go out of my way to search for people who has gone through the same things as i because im just not gonna make a post anywhere or go on some friendrelationship making app with a bio saying about what ive been through because i dont want to lay it all out there just like that because thats inappropriate and that i just wouldnt want to open up that way i would want a gradual relationship to blossom from being vulnerable and building intimacy after a considerable period of time before talking too deep into the worse aspects of my life ya know as someone with trust issues i need time to be sure i can share all of that im always thinking and hoping that maybe one day i would meet a special someone that would for once make me feel i am loved because they dont have to try to understand but because they just do i speak from a place that whenever i have spoken and been vulnerable about what i think or feel about anything they dont agree with or understand i often receive a response that makes me feel belittled misunderstood and disrespected from familial to platonic to romantic relationships i never have felt i am seen or heard with love and patience unless its something they believe and or know about rather i am scolded or looked at in skepticism or blatantly insulted for merely sharing something as little as expressing an opinion which always comes from a place of being respectful to even expressing an interest of mine which comes from a place of love and passion gets mocked and made fun of the very few people i would consider close in my life dont make me feel loved sure i feel cared about at times such as my parents providing for me cared for in times when friends would reach out and ask about how im doing and cared that i get to have consistent affectionate and attention from my romantic relationship and yet these people have hurt me and whenever ive told them that they have hurt me they either dismiss my vulnerability of communicating my needs and wants which should be taken as a damn compliment i even talk to them to just being downright disrespectful to me i thought they loved me you dont hurt the people you love i always end up ending the conversation and changing topic by telling them its fine or nvm or ill get over it or the worst of it all telling them i was overreacting and that im sorry for saying anything and that theyre right for calling me out for calling them out i cant be gaslit but i sure as hell can act like it to avoid conflict dont i ha ha ha the things i do for love because i dont want to hurt them even though they hurt me first its really not hard to be a decent person especially to a loved one i dont find it difficult why do they a part of me also thinks the only way i could ever get better and i dont mean outright cured of avpd but rather just live easier with myself and with other people in this life in a much less difficult way is to have that person by my side who also has avpd that can truly understand and love me and whod uplift me and basically all that good things we should expect from being in a relationship whether platonic or romantic but here i am having doubts that i may not even deserve that and that i should settle because i fear i will never meet that great person i so badly need to love and be loved by i recently have been reading this book called all about love new visions by bell hooks its really given me insight and confirmation about what love really is and one thing i will mention here that is talked about in the book is that abuse and love cannot coexist its a hard pill to swallow but it is something that we should talk about more i suggest all of you to read it its an amazing book just as the author is tldr ive taken up my time to either thinking and maladaptive daydreaming of connecting and having a relationship with someone who i am very much alike with such as sharing same traumas that led both of us to have avpd i want and need someone who truly is a great person that not only cares but listens and understands with patience about my thoughts feelings well being and general existence that would make me feel the love i truly deserve because people close to me in my life have not given that love but yet i fear i will never that and even doubt myself that i might not even deserve that love to anyone that has read this far thank you for listening and i hope you have a good daynight,3

just curious about this ive noticed in myself that while i can say it to my family members i have trouble saying it to anyone else i have a few close friends in particular who say it a lot to me and to one another and i just cant say it back for some reason and its not that i dont care about my friends its just some mental block in my head i guess saying it to parents or siblings feels more automatic in a way i guess and is therefore less uncomfortable such as ending a phone call with love you bye love you too bye but outside of that i have trouble with it does anyone else experience this view pollhttpswwwredditcompollltnzn,3

i wanna know if you guys can relate to these points or not i try not to speak loudly on my own with myself so other people cannot hear you i recall and get critical about any past conversation you had recently at times word to word i dont want to meet or get confronted by someone to avoid getting questioned at about the very thing i fear that i lack and i would be open to those questions once i fix those things i feel i have so much potential,3
today i found out that atychiphobia is the clinical term for the fear of failure ive been consumed by atychiphobia ever since my teenage years ive purposely passed up on big opportunities due to it and as a result held myself back multiple times well now ive stumbled upon a hurdle that i need to overcome in order to achieve my next goal in life ive been looking for ways to bypass the hurdle so i dont have to potentially experience failure but i cant seem to find any other ways forward the reality is ill have to attempt to overcome this obstacle in order to move forward but its terrifying knowing i might never overcome it anyone ever experienced similar or have tips for overcoming this fear,3
ive literally been keeping all my feelings inside for years so its all just been building up and a few weeks ago i had a total breakdown and texted this guy i barely know just telling him about this thing that happened and hes like twice my age and i just work next to him i saw him a fair bit but i never really talked to him of course because avpd so things were just always awkward but the thing is he was super nice about it and so then i way overshared and texted him a bunch of personal shit and it made total sense when i was sending it and then the next day i was like what the hell did i send this guy and now i feel so embarrassed and i just dont know what to do with this feeling and the worst part is i still cant talk to him i saw him for the first time the other day since sending that text and he was being so nice about it and i still couldnt talk to him and i might not see him again for a while because my job is kinda changing right now but i just dont know what to do with this feeling tldr got super emotional and texted this guy who i barely talked to a bunch of personal shit so now he knows that im messed up and also knows that im so pathetic and alone that i like him way more than i should and i dont know what to do with this embarrassment,3
so i work as a cashier and this saturday th was supposed to be my last day there end of my contract which was going to be renewed but last saturday th after my long shift i decided i couldnt go through another week at this workplace so i took all my stuff and left for good without telling anyone this job has burnt me out so much and gave me panic attacks and i didnt see myself staying there another week but i was mostly afraid to tell my boss that i didnt want to renew my contract too scared to see disappointment on her face and to let them down so by quiting early i wouldnt have to face this situation i didnt show up on monday and didnt call but i sent to hr a doctors note from my psychiatrist telling them that i am taking a break from work my boss has tried to call me yesterday but i didnt respond i feel shitty right now and i hate this avpd this fear of confrontation and disappointing is killing me,3
i think i have social anxiety no official diagnosis because getting any kind of official diagnosis is difficult here but its fairly obvious and several mental health professionals ive seen acknowledged it but i recognise myself a lot in the symptoms of avpd i tried looking online what the exact difference between social anxiety and avpd but i didnt really find anything useful or well explained enough this disorder seems fairly unknown to me and im struggling to find ressources how do you know its avpd and not social anxiety is there any good ressources books youtube channel website on this topic that you would recommend is it okay for me self diagnose,3
it feels like avpd and social anxiety are becoming more prevalent especially younger generations and that this was exacerbated by the pandemic even before the pandemic it was an issue with the use of social media fueling a rise in mental health issues but the isolation of the pandemic obviously made things worse maybe avpd will become more mainstream in a few years,3
how does one find someone selling weed when they have no friends i think itd really help me i dont want to buy it online its too complicated and risky,3
is it true that the significant difference between avpd and sad is that people with avpd arent interested in social relationships whereas social phobics are indeed interested in those but their anxiety wont let them,3
deep down im still that poor scared little boy who lost his confidence beaten and humiliated and alone so desperately alone beyond that and deeper perhaps is a skeleton where the man should be held together by wishes and fantasies of what it means to be of what it means to deserve and the empty bravado and bloviations of a synthetic confidence made of air now i can play the role of the confident man i can laugh and smile and charm and begile and speak with an iron certainty that brooks no argument and most would be tricked into thinking this is strength but these are nothing more than the desperate craven thrusts of defense a pained and insecure theatre to hide my own inadequacy from inquiring eyes i feel so worthless so replaceable so expendable if i am not the absolute best then how can i be valuable at all how can someone not replace me how can i feel secure within my relationship with others everywhere i look i notice others better than me people who are better looking taller smarter with nicer bodies and i cannot escape the realisation that these people could replace and take from me everything that i hold dear i have an adoring girlfriend but how long will that last how can i trust in permanence when so many better than me exist when the wheels of fate are always in motion spinning towards a yet unknown destination every man man is my rival every man is better than me i must be perfect otherwise i am worthless somewhere along the way during adolescence and early adulthood fear gripped my heart it squeezed and twisted me into submission until i felt powerless to travel any road that was not certain and safe in persuing safety i was tricked into embracing comfort which came for me in the from of constant daily drinking for five years i drank and drank and isolated until i was emaciated malnourished alone so desperately alone wasted pitiful weak hopeless and broken the indifference and apathy that was birthed by alcohol facilitied me leaving university abandoning the future i had dreamed of since a small boy and finally extinguishing the withering flame of hope that i did not know still existed inside of me i slept on empty rum bottles littering a dirty and dark floor in a small room i seldom washed or showered or ate and i only left the house to buy enough alcohol to fuel my twoletresaday rum habit i was so alone so desperately alone i spent over half a year without any communication with others at all and then only interacted with basic pleasantries in the couple of years that followed yet somehow against all predictions i stopped drinking that was almost two years ago now since that moment i have not faltered once nor did i ever fear doing so i was at rock bottom i knew that i could not drink anymore the realisation hit me suddenly with force sufficient to stop me mid step on my way to buy rum a voice in my head clear and confident and smooth stated you cant do this anymore and thus the decision to never drink again was made and i cannot go against decisions already made in the same way i cannot reverse the motion that broke a glass against the floor from that moment i have worked hard to build myself up from the creature i was now on the precipice of achieving two years of uninterrupted sobriety i have a new respectable fulltime job i workout five times a week i have a loving girlfriend and yet i am haunted by the immutable weight of my own inadequacies and regrets everyone around me is more successful than i am my girlfriend is currently on a buisness trip abroad surrounded by other people of stature significance and importance and what am i an addict a university dropout and a worthless talentless static waste of life i know that i cannot compare my life and success to others every person you meet has travelled a different path to yours with different privillages and struggles and a completely different set of potentials i should only reflect on the life i have lived judging my success by the progress i have made i understand this logically it makes sense only i cannot help but compare i want to be more so much more i need to be more i want to go back to university but i fear i am not smart enough i had no confidence in going in the first place but it was a path i was on so i did not dwell on the fear now with the flow of this path disrupted i cannot find within myself the confidence to take the plunge back into formal education i am inert with doubt why is it i cannot move past my regrets why do i feel so inadequate,3
for most of the time my brain is overwhelmed by emotions rather than thoughts rational or irrational like i think about something a lot but its never really connected to my life in any tangible or material way,3
honestly this is more of a screaming into the void post than anything im kind of sick of just not doing anything all day everyday kind of feels like a repeat of the same day im awful at making friends every attempt has been pretty much futile im still trying though i want to be productive but i have so many issues with starting anything i run away from everything even though im well aware thatll cause even more issues but anything to delay the pain i guess im awful i need to make changes in my life but its so hard and any change i make just makes me wanna go back into my reclusive life whenever i see anything about people my age or younger achieve something that i never will i get pissy but i dont do anything to better myself afterwards i used to workout as a way to be productive but man i have a chronic illness that just makes that impossible now i feel like a complete total loser i used to be one of those gifted kids and everyone had such high expectations of me but now im just a loser with underdeveloped social skills i almost feel like theres no one in this world thats dealing with the same issues,3
i have been suspecting about having avpd for quite some time knowing that my inability to have close relationships and function in society wasnt just my fault but is due to a condition conforts me and gives me some pointers on what to do to battle it i really really really dont want to keep on living this cold walledin hikikomori hell i was in throughout my teenage years and twenties and boy did i gather all my willpower to try and change my situatuon asking this friend out over and over trying to send them memes to make them laugh and engaging with what they were posting they ghosted me so i stopped reaching out to them i gathered that they just didnt want to be around me it really hurt and i blamed myself for beint unlikable and all after months i slowly started healing back again and just moved on recently they came out as having avpd to me and other friends and i now sorta hold a grudge against this person i know im supposed to be understanding and all because ive been there i am there actually but also fuck no i put a lot of effort and courage in asking them to hang out every week at a certain point i got tired of asking and being constantly ignoredrejected especially in addition to little jokes about how ugly badly dressed and socially awkward i was and how my bf probably cheats on me made me relapse pretty badly how convenient to be cruel to the jobless lonely loser and then blame it on avpd,3
not sure if anyone shared this here before its from but i thought it was an interesting read,3
im sure im not the only one doing this but i find myself shutting down and withdrawing from people and situations to such an extent that i am unable to look them in the eye it is triggered through different mechanisms but most often than not it is triggered by a situation in which i feel less worthy than what i already am i have low self esteem and an extremely negative view of myself notwithstanding my past having an influence on that view some situations may come across as innocent suppose you were friends with someone not direct friends a friend of your significant other or a friend of a friend this friend takes interest in you only at times where they are in your company or having a mental meltdown in my case they never text truth be told they never even ask about you another example people ask you your opinion about something you give it thinking it may be of use but then it turns out they didnt even bother listening or they brag to you about a choice they made when you suggested it in the first place you feel like nobody sees you nobody respects you nobody listens to you i withdraw and i shut down although i can try and look past it i can never truly get over it it adds to my negative outlook on life and it breaks me down further soon therell be nothing left to break i feel alone levels thats been elevating over the last couple of years i dont know if life is truly worth pursuing anymore any way dont mind me just another rant,3
this applies to social anxiety disorder and many other mental illnesses but if the sense of self is so negative it also creates a negative perception of other people and applies it back onto oneself as the center object even if selfesteem is low and esteem for others is idealized its important to teach people to have positive selfesteem regardless of what other people but also to challenge the perceptions of other people in the first place,3
i know that people who have their psyche together have an extremely hard time finding jobs too we live in very confusing times and im less employable than most people of my age i dont have a finished degree i dont have presentable look i dont really have hobbies other than videogames and some niche knowledge about obscure culture things im not great at communicating but more importantly i havent worked or studied in about years at this point so i pretty much forgot how to look and present human at this point im not really interested in anything in the normal sense either due to anhedonia or general dissociation from my own emotions and needs im thinking about therapy as something that could guide me and help me in life i know this is really all eggs in one basket kind of thing but i genuinely only believe in one thing and its therapy and to pay for any therapy i need money but im so lost and hopeless in navigating job market im practically terrified because im a grown ass person and i have never worked in my life before other than one small online gig i got by pure luck and it was a one time thing and its not repeatable and skills for that dont transfer anywhere ive heard about things like rev or something like that but they banned my country because of recent world events i was researching different sort of freelance stuff but i consistently got terrified of having to promote myself or even commit to any craft at all due to selfdefeating attitude my whole life so in the end i dont know anything dont have any skills other than fluent english and my native language have absolutely no experience of any job whatsoever it feels incredibly hopeless any tips maybe some websites that could help with making small money for manageable tasks ill be very grateful for any response,3
maybe im being too critical but i feel like therapy has not been helpful to me i had finally reached out for help just before the pandemic and was seeing a therapist she was extremely nice and it did help finally having someone to talk to when everything switched to remote sessions during the pandemic it seemed like she rushed through our sessions and sometimes they would be over in minutes i didnt confront her about this i ended up just ghosting im not happy with myself for doing that but its part of this illness i guess i then went through my local university because i had read they had a good social anxiety program and saw a few a student therapists again all very nice people but i still felt stuck about a year after seeing a few student therapists i was informed my current student therapist was finishing their program and that i would need to find a new therapist outside of their program they offered to show me how to find one on psychology today i was already well aware of how to do this and was a bit surprised with how it seemed like they were just dumping me off im years old it took me decades to finally ask for help im not blaming anyone and i need to put in the work to succeed but i have to say i was a bit disillusioned by the whole therapy experience just being honest,3
i hold onto memories of people who have left me seemingly endlessly good ones bad ones perhaps because i believe they must be some kind of special person to have enjoyed my company i think my connections have always been more deep for me than the other person because im desperate i wish i wouldnt remember them wipe it all clean constantly being hit with intrusive thoughts of everyone who isnt around and how difficult those relationships were is exhausting i had a dream about a close friend who abandoned me justifiably not even my self esteem talking i was a shitty person then reconciling with me over lunch extremely vivid and i felt so at peace after our conversation so glad that she wanted to talk with me again then i wake up from this bliss all alone go to school alone come home and make dinner alone go back to sleep alone its absolutely crushing to be so alone and feel like you dont have the tools to come back from that,3
i am lucky to have a few friends but they dont reply for days and i just wish i had lots of people to talk to sometimes or when you do something coolinteresting and realise you dont have anyone to tell but i know if i did have close people like that id be stressed all the time about the relationships,3
which character can you relate to the most and feels like they truly embody your personal experience ill go first and say so far its probably elsa of frozen for me,3
i always knew that my dad was low eq but my biggest epiphany was realizing that even my mom is low eq you always think that because women tend to express their emotions so readily that theyre high in eq but beware that is not the case emotional expressiveness is not the same as emotional intelligence,3
this is kind of a stupid petty thing to talk about but honestly i just wanna get this off my chest i have a friend weve been friends for like years already and weve basically grown up together we were both sort of socially withdrawn so all we had were one another and so wed talk everyday all day i remember this one time we had a conversation where they told me that they tend to ghost people and slowly pull back when they feel as if talking to someone starts to feel draining or they just dont like the person anymore lately theyve been pulling away like replying less and less and just ignoring me for the entire day though sometimes theyd stay and have a full conversation with me but its kind of rare and i get the feeling that they do it only to keep me there like to ensure my stay kind of like a push and pull its not like they dont have time either sometimes when wed have a half conversation theyd always and i say always talk about how theyre connecting with someone how they had fun with someone new all this passionate stuff and it just stings a bit by a bit i mean a lot i know im not entitled to their time by any means but like i just feel like ive been hit by a truck i know theyre purposely ignoring me i know theyre losing interest in me i even get the feeling that were growing out of one another im just wondering what about me isnt enough thats worthy of their time am i not interesting enough am i boring i dont know oh well shit happens i suppose im trying to fight the urge to isolate myself for half a year because i keep feeling rejected by them,3
i keep seeing all these humans doing something they enjoy doing something theyre good at doing something thar earns them a living worse than that i keep seeing character development and growth i keep seeing humans getting better and i hate it when is it gonna be my turn no matter how fucking long its been nothing fucking changes,3
im not sure who to fight for because i dont know who my enemies are im sorry to those who were like me who i could not be there hold strong,3
ive been mostly lurking around here for many months now and im constantly seeing posts that make me feel like i dont belong or im an odd one out like other people think and communicate in a certain way thats different from my own or have an understanding of what avpd means that clashes with my own or they have fairly ordinary life experiences or achievements that seem impossible for me i dont know how much of it is due to the condition itself if avpd is even the right label for my specific brand of brokenness and how much of it is due to objective differences related to the fairly unusual path ive taken through life also reddit is regarded to have a kind of hive mind where posters tend to express similar views in similar ways to the point where its difficult to distinguish individuals i see myself as an outsider looking at that from a distance but do any of you see yourself as being a part of that if you dont feel you fit in why is that specifically what details about you clash with what you perceive as the reddit or ravpd cultures and if you do feel you fit in especially on reddit in general how does that relate to your avpd is it easier to wear a metaphorical mask as a part of a collective something like that that maskwearing is something i see mentioned a lot here which makes me feel like i dont fit in as i dont do it view pollhttpswwwredditcompollkvhz,3
in pete walkers work there are types of trauma responses fight flight freeze and the last least spoken about fawn fawning is just as it sounds you fawn over people you people please and bend to their will even if you know its fucking you over in the long run i feel like being a fawn has caused me to hate people even more than i should lol because when people come around they usually come with some bs that i dont really want anything to do with wanting favors wanting me to be their emotional punching bag wanting validation wanting talk at me wanting me to give them stuff etc i dont have a back bone and its really hard for me to tell people to kick rocks without feeling guilty so it just becomes another reason why i isolate myself nobody can drag me into their drama if nobody is there to begin with are you like this,3
the drive which most people were just born with dopamine cascades or whatever then theres us the folk who just dont thrive on attention and competition i absolutely believe we were born this way ive tried and failed to describe this to so many psychiatrists and psychologists its not even funny anymore the schizoids call this anhedonia myself ive always struggled to orgasm during sex we are ok were not psychopaths we have empathy and we have all the things in place in order to love,3
hj you dont actually gotta hold my hand aha,3
i think this is like a generalized imposter syndrome typically people feel like an imposter in their field of work but this would be like that in all cases i have a pretty underdeveloped sense of self while were at it does anybody else constantly smile in social situations to minimize the chances of having to deal with hostility danger or stress from the other person i just had the thought recently that this is why i smile constantly while talking to people i recall the first time somebody asked me why i smiled all the time i genuinely had no idea that i was smiling but that would explain why people are usually cheerful around me apparently this is referred to as fawning,3
title but whats a jobcareer that an avoidant would strongly dislike or may struggle with doing core components of the job successfully,3
one of the most common questions on this subreddit is the difference between sad and avpd lately ive been trying to put it like this social anxiety im afraid theyll see how nervous i am fear of embarrassment avpd im afraid theyll see how inept i am fundamental belief of inferiority on top of that avpd is more severe prevalent in every aspect of life and persistant theres no periods where you dont feel it whereas sad is situational you might not feel anxiety in every social situation and go through periods where you feel lessno anxiety but the belief of being inferior has to be the main thing that sets avpd apart from sad because of this deeprooted belief every social interaction everything someone says can be taken as rejection and therefore as a confirmation of our beliefs about ourselves even positive situations can confirm these beliefs they like me now but once they really know me theyll hate me or theyre only pretending to like me another thing is the belief of inferiority often shows up outside of social situations eg avoiding doing homeworkwriting essays or even hobbies because you feel like it wouldnt be good enough does this make sense please correct me if its too generalizing i might delete this post later,3
wouldnt that be great a general acceptance understanding of eachothers issues instant common ground ive been able to discuss mental health in general with people but this disorder is so specific i feel you have to have it to truly grasp what its like to walk a day in the shoes,3
obviously i think therapy is extremely important this but i also think its one of those things that can be selfdiagnosed with the age of the internet its easy to get into the mode of selfdiagnosis whether it be for physical or mental illness but i feel emotionally struck by this its not a fun thing or something that feels relatable it strikes me to the core and i dont want it to i dont want this to be the reality but it resonates so much more than social anxiety disorder ever did im not saying that a feeling is an indicator of the truth but ive read a lot about it and continuously have tried to think of ways in which i may not but it fits so well beyond on the symptoms ive dung into the roots the commo thought patterns behaviors etc its not something i feel will pull me down or become a selffulfilling prophecy because as painful as its been to learn about its something i feel refreshed by in having language to explain my experiences and perception of myself i thought i was self aware before but i had a lot of false beliefs and i also have a tendency to detach from my unhealthy and hurtful behaviors,3
so im m diagnosed adult with high functioning autism i have been lurking the schizoid community for some time because i have so much in common with the guys who post over there mostly its the anhedonia that really strikes a chord with me the prevailing attitude over at rschizoid seems to be this cavalier stance that loneliness is just a preference well i take issue with this myself ive been isolating on and off so much since even before puberty sure it kind of feels good to not have to spend cognitive energy on social stuff but loneliness is taking a toll on me my brain operates on use it or lose it and i feel that now more than ever especially since covid the more i isolate which is something i can do day to day without sacrificing too much in the short run the less high functioning i become i guess i substitute beer vidyas and parasocially engaging on youtube for the real thing its kind of working but i really miss intimacy and that human connection i feel like im ever so slowly spiraling into insanity,3
hi all ive been job searching since august but now that i have an offer for an inperson interview days from now im really struggling to respond just to say that i can make it i guess my education makes me very overqualified for it or something and its seemingly a relatively asocial role but the thought of even going to the interview fills me with anxiety i know i have to change my circumstances but the clearest opportunities to do so are the points of greatest resistance,3
i was wondering what attachment style usually is related to avpd i feel like i have fearfulavoidant since im for the most part really avoidant towards pretty much everyone but if i get close to someone i finally found some i can really trust and like very dearly im very anxious for the most part and needy theres times where i feel negatively towards them mostly when i was too open but that happened mostly in the beginning now if it happens i know its due to fear of something and it goes away rather quickly,3
thats it thats the post,3
i dont care if this sounds edgy im going to mention it anyways ive been bullied out of school as the same with online ive began to develop a hatred for anyone thats not like me i had a vent account and the amount of people who just didnt understand how severe my isolation was insane i had so many people telling me you just want to be edgy and i even got called incel on numerous occasions for saying women and relationships make me feel uncomfortable it felt like everytime i reached out to others on the internet what i thought could be a safe space lmao there was always someone who had to pick me apart and find everything wrong with me after awhile i gave up trying to reach out and now on other social media accounts i say things just to piss people off even if i dont agree with the things i say online half the time i just need to get that rage from some people i dont know how this fixes anything for myself if anything youd think people telling me to end my life for fake opinions would get me to stop ive come to hate almost everyone as long as i know people were mad enough to send me death threats i feel like ive given them some sort of revenge i cant do anything about what happened to me in my personal life and i hate it i think feeling lonely for so long has made me feel anger toward those who didnt accept me have any of you also gone through this or do i seriously need therapy,3
i cant imagine going to a clothing store buy only on the internet if i buy online the size does not fit i dont need a lot of clothes because i dont have to go out i dont even go to the barbershop i cut my own hair there is a supermarket right next to the house but i dont go there necessary items are purchased through internet delivery i used to go to the supermarket often when i was young but im years old and still unemployed so im afraid the supermarket owner will recognize me,3
why are the descriptions of every job so alienating like i just dont get why they write them like that not everyone they hire is a good communicator or excellent at whatever or fast paced fuck im middle aged and i cant do anything yes a bunch of that is the shame voice but so it feels like everything is constantly rejecting me by putting barriers everywhere and im already fucking exhausted from having to be alive i just feel so dejected about doing literally anything for money its been my most difficult barrier and all i want is someone to be gentle with me so i can trust them and give working a shot but if they only want people with social and other skills they already dont want me so how is that fair,3
are there any jobs that people are surviving with preferably something remote i do play based therapy with toddlers with autism and my client is not doing well in a classroom environment that he moved to in december there is a boy who seeks him out and tries to bully him yesterday this girl in the classroom confronts me about how his tantrums are not because he is overwhelmed but insinuating that i cause the behaviors because i let him out of activities when he is upset well i dont want to traumatize a year old so i do try to be sensitive to him and his needs i think putting a year old with a lot of sensitivities in a loud classroom was a bad idea anyway it is am and i cant sleep because of this i need a new job i need a new job i need a new job i just dont know what,3
starting to learn more about avpd people talk about the fight or flight reaction and i myself have experienced it where i thought i either have to fight or run away but i was wondering if pw avpd ever experience this and hence grow up to be somewhat antisocial,3
were presenting our art pieces to a panel of really judgemental people there are horror stories of them being rude to people that present their work and judging them pretty harshly im not sure how legit those stories are but im really scared im worried ill cry in front of everybody if i get criticized too hard on top of that executive dysfunction absolutely wrecked me this semester and my art pieces are pretty fucking shit its not the case of an artist doesnt see how beautiful their art is its objectively rushed because i couldnt work on it im so scared c,3
ive worked as a baker at a cafe for a little under a year and here bakers are supposed to also answer the phone and take orders have some cashier training which i just couldnt really do so we worked out a tentative agreement for me to only do opening baking which is only about hours a week today my boss told me that ive been doing really good work and that hes over me not answering the phone because its obvious i care about what im doing now ive got more hoursresponsibilites the same days off every week pto and a raise i started here when i was still in high school so this kinda feels like ive done something to prove myself as a real employee even though i never really think im doing good at all but it gives me so much hope that even if ill never be with communication theres still good qualities i have and people can appreciate them the thing im happiest about is that they know i care because i really really do and i didnt think there was any way to express it,3
at my job there is only one drinking fountain in the very large floor i work at so that means its always crowded as if thats not bad enough its far from my office which means you have to cross paths with loads of people to get there for those reasons going for water is always a nightmare of awkwardness and anxiety and i avoid it as much as possible as a result i end up so thirsty most of the day craving that delicious cold water but the thirst is not worse than the suffering the anxiety gives me this disorder is so fkng weird,3
i didnt choose this i didnt choose to be scared of people i didnt choose to be avoidant and have stupid anxieties in social settings the thing that people think that i am like this by choice hurts me even more its like i had a choice at the start of my life to and i chose to have serious mental illnesses i didnt choose this just environment where i lived caused me this people dont really tell me this but the way they behave around me is obvious that they think that i it is my choice,3
recently i was watching a live of personality disorders and this psychiatry said that there is a reason of why avpd isnt diagnosed enough or clinically useless i didnt like this term sometimes the avpd is mild so its confused with a normal anxiety or when more serious its diagnosed as social anxiety the aforementioned speech makes me real pessimistic about this disorder as iit makes clear that we are really neglected clinically useless what the hell i think that theres a reason for so much misinformation about avpd the people who know the most about this disorder are those who suffer daily on skin but we cant provide clinical care because we are weakened so theres a big cycle of misinformation and no progress in short average people cannot understand us satisfactorily advances on this disorder will certainly come but i believe it will not be so soon i hope you guys may have understood my point discussions are open,3
i have a huge problem with anxiety at work and have very big problems with avoidance my emotional difficulties have gotten to the point many times where i have made absolutely awful mistakes at work and have been too panickedincapacitatedcowardly to take responsibility for myself its become a negative cycle spanning years and i never seem to get better its decimated my self esteem and riddled my life with stress and anxiety and of course imposter syndrome in every professional situation with any decent level of responsibility under pressure i dont push through and rise to the challenge i completely choke and take my hands off the wheel in panicavoidance causing car crash situations and so much stress to those who manage me if i wasnt working with family i would be fired and destitute as i feel i cant be trusted with anything everyone in my circle is very smart and high functioning and can take responsibility for themselves and be relied upon to get their jobs done im and i cant take myself seriously as an adult i suppose what i want to ask is if any of this resonates with you guys im just lost as to what is wrong with me to be so ineffectual and i feel so much shame apologies for the rant,3

i was thinking that avpd isnt caused by some brain illness it is very possible that most people with avpd have healthy brain right i feel like avpd is just that we learned things incorrectly we were exposed to some very stressful situations as child and our brains learned that that situation this is bad and now our functioning brain is reminding us with anxiety that this situation is familiar from past when we were learning things and this anxiety is causing us to avoid these situations because we were learnt that they are bad so from this point we can say that our brain is normally functioning brain is doing what it is supposed to be doing trying to stay out of danger and survive,3
two weeks before my calc prof came to tell me how disappointed he was in me for my poor grades and lack of turning in assignments it had way too much of an impact i literally couldnt show up to the next two classes i finally get back and hes doing standard lecture stuff talking while scanning the large crowd so people feel more engaged his eyes grazed mine a second i know it meant nothing logically its just how people talk to crowds sweeping eyes but in that moment i decided his gaze was a glare a disapproving irritated message straight to me i felt like a failure terrible i left the classroom quietly soon as i reached the hallway i ran i ran to the bathroom to throw up just a second of eye contact and it destroyed me i hate being like this lmao,3

just wanting to get an idea of the number of people who are limerant for unavailable people for me its always a man in a teaching or mentorship position who is married married because that means im safe hes not going to act im not going to act there isnt going to be a relationship the attraction is just going to float in the air like a butterfly such intense but unattainable beauty so much out of reach i am in close almost daily contact with such a man its annoying me because i know its hopeless and could never go anywhere but i am addicted to it addicted to any little morsel of recognition he gives me addicted to making him laugh it makes my day to make him laugh he has no idea about the depth of my feelings because i am a person with avpd and i know how to hide my emotions even lie about them and shut everything down my brain is basically screaming stay safe stay safe i dont know who i am more annoyed with me or him i think making him laugh is the way i make him comfortable with my attraction to him its like it must be pretty obvious im basically broadcasting i dont love you im just an awkward friendly doofus please like me it is intensely sad to me that this is the closest i will get to love but even that is addictive sad beauty sad beauty is better than the grey anhedonia i am used to i hope this makes sense i hope someone understands or can relate,3
my self confidence could not be any lower after years of rejection and not fitting in anywhere i now realise if i just dont get involved with people ill be ok its always been one step foward two steps back when i try to intergrate cant be rejected and hurt if im on my own and thats starting to seem fine to me,3
i was diagnosed with avpd a little over weeks ago after knowing what it is for years and being in various stages of denial ive spent most of the past couple weeks just feeling shitty and hopeless but i decided to reach out to people a couple days ago went on a date yesterday and hung out with an old friend i havent seen in years and their friend for a couple hours today i even texted a support group chat to hold me accountable even though i usually never say anything plus my roommates had people over yesterday and while i still isolated i at least got myself to make polite conversation in passing old habits die hard so im not exactly expecting this to stick yet but im proud of myself,3
whenever i see a in a text or instant message i know i must answer it otherwise it will seem rude that to me is simple the problem i have is if someone follows it up with a comment is it rude to just leave it on read sometimes i will want to reply or add something to it but i worry it will prolong the conversation and make it harder to finish it i could say something simple like yes or definitely but it sounds kinda lazy to communicate like that like i just left someone on read after their comment and cant help but think i should have made a short reply just to acknowledged it at least,3
i would really like to have an avpd friend to talk to when i really dont feel like putting on this stupid mask of pretending to be normal im years old looking for someone preferably around my age also im from cali n latino hopefully i can meet up n be irl friends shoot me a dm i just think that if i cant find my place anywhere else i can find it here with yall i mean we understand exactly what its like to be this way so i just wanna say that ill be accepting of u and i hope you will too i just dont want to feel so alone,3
tw angry rant ahead what the hell is the oppression olympics between avpd and szpd all about with some people on this sub there are all these casual mentions of things like well my life sucks but at least im happy i dont have szpd that keep showing up lately why not just say something about being relieved not having to experience social anhedonia its not the only symptom experienced by people with szpd although it seems to be simplified into that i dont understand the obsessive need of some of the people in this sub to glorify that they are somehow winning against other mental ill people simply because they dont experience social anhedonia experiencing social anhedonia is not a intentional choice of people with schizoid pd it would be like saying people with adhd are choosing to be inattentive also there is a lot more to szpd then the one symptom that some people in this sub seem to be hyperfixating on end rant,3
anyone else have to think about if theyre avoidingpushing away someone because they genuinely dont like that person or just because commitment is scary i moved in with a friend and surprise surprise it didnt go well but also there were a lot of things they did that really upset and when i expressed my feelings they used my mental health against me despite the fact that i never really talked about it with them in the first place this is just one example of someone who i wonder if it was my mental healthavoidance issues or if i genuinely didnt want to be around them because of the layers of things they did that upset me while living together that made me see who they truly were as a person or am i just coming up with excuses,3
my cousins y often come to my house they are pretty noisy at night and i like to go to bed early so it bothers me i tell them to be quiet but soon they are making a lot of noise again sometimes i went up to them and scold them sometimes even calling them names such was the anger my mother says that i am not very understanding and very hard on them i feel like i got a little bit of the avoidant trait from her personality im not diagnosed with avpd but im pretty sure that i have it idk if this reactive response to noise could be a cptsd thing in summary i wanna now if this is a avpd response anyone relate i hope that its understandable english isnt my frist language,3
i am currently making a transition from being a barista and supervisor at a coffee chain to attempting becoming a baker retail has burnt me out to my core exacerbated my avpd and im convinced making this change might help me feel more at peace in my daytoday because i have more control over my social interactions at work however i am having a hard time maintaining contact with the bakeries im trying to be recognized by without running into those anxieties that lead me to putting off an email or stopping by to introduce myself for a little too long and thusly becoming what some would consider unprofessional in my communications would anyone have any advice to spare about how to apologize for the wait and possible inconvenience when and how do i advocate for myself if its likely how can i save my professional relationships with others when i let my anxiety call too many shots,3
it happened to me few times in my life i felt like there was a girl who was interested in me and then suddenly she became mad at me and it was without reason maybe the reason was that she expected me to do something but i did nothing and then suddenly her very friendly behavior changed to mad behavior and she started avoiding me this is one of the things i am really good at other than that i am bad pretty much at anything,3
i almost dont talk to any of them but there is one guy i kinda like so of course i avoid him even more once in a while we happen to meet in the kitchen and he usually initates some conersation he is very nice and i feel like hed be understanding would it be weird to tell him something like sorry i dont talk much to you guys i have avoidant personality idk i feel like it might make him uncomfortable and its kind of oversharing but i feel like itd remove this barrier between us at least a little bit idk i might be wrong,3
i dont know whats like in here but on rschizoid avpd is discussed very often all sorts of questions and discussions because we avoid people as well but for another reason so we always have someone asking if they are schizoid or avpd and what the differences are anyways i was very curious to come check you all and id like to know this nothing complex whats your favorite hobby plus do you you feel like you would have different hobbies if you didnt avoid people if so what would you love to do share your dreams i go first i can spend an entire day just looking at a wall i dont have hobbies my schizo side doesnt stop at my schizoid personality so i cant speak for the entire schizoid sub but if you check there youll see that we dont like much stuff music is almost an unanimity but besides that you wont find much so im always curious to know what people likes it fascinates me,3
because avoiding makes so much sense to you do you also actively dont want relationships in terms of wanting to stay on your own amp not wanting to want relationships relationships are not paying off i dont view being avoidant amp mostly alone a bad thing only the insecurity and anxiety in social situations is what i want to get rid of,3

does anyone have any experience with psychedelics ive personally never done them but i feel like they could possibly be useful in treating noncurable disorders like avpd in a guided session with a certified therapist ive read about the dissolution of ego people some times experience during psychedelic trips and it seems like that would be helpful for avpd,3
i just want to have friends and a girlfriend like a normal person i have friends but i cant relate to them i feel very uncomfortable around them i feel like they bully me treat me badly and do stuff i find uncomfortable i have two siblings that are able to function socially and have friends and lovers it is too painful i feel extreme envy since i was a child i used to hang out with my brothers friends cause i was too socially inept to make my own i am still that way i feel i am filled with extreme suicidal pain everyday i try to have some hope and carry on and soothe myself but the pain is so immense and i am struggling to keep up the hope it is horrific how do you guys stay hopeful and optimistic do you see any progress,3

years old never dated id rather be alone than put myself out there and risk rejection that is not to say that i prefer to be alone the loneliness sucks but just thinking about being rejected hurts too much,3
i feel very alone which i have a lot of my life subconsciously so its not usually an issue but the last months especially have been intensely lonely i go the gym try to eat good meditate etc some things help temporarily but most of the time im in my own head its weird i get along with most people i come into contact with but also actively avoid a further friendship from any of them the only pressure i feel to have friends is because its viewed as odd for a female to have no friends my family members all have friends or people they hang out withme i isolate with my dog in my room i even play games alone now couldnt handle having gaming friends anymore the only person i talk to is my cousin i want to escape everything i feel but im trapped,3
had a yt channel got a decent amount of views deleted the channel and all videos had an account on an art website where i spent countless hours sharing art i spent countless hours on everyday deleted it it had the only copies of my art last time i sketched was used to game for hours everyday deleted all my games and got rid of my console and tv used to play instruments working on an album got rid of the instruments and the songs tried a dating app outta curiosity got matches blocked them deleted the app got interviews for my dream companies declined them used to love books reading entire novels front to back in one sitting now my mind goes blank when i see blocks of text i had to separate the lines in this post to read it ordered food cancelled because i didnt wanna be seen by the driver or any neighbors used to play sports and go to the gym daily quit all sports and havent been to the gym in years having stupid mini anxiety attacks because im scared my avoidance of everything is catching up to me and ill be homeless saving as much money as i can because i refuse to believe i actually have a job or deserve one scared that the amount i saved isnt enough and im doomed if i lose my job scared that my minor health issues might actually be major,3

ive been told im pretty but i almost never believe it lol i dont like attention of any kind good or bad i noticed that i have this weird perfectionism that i have to look good for people ofc you want to be presentable but i take it overboard i wont leave my house if i feel too badly about my appearance that day i feel like im offending people by not looking good im pretty sure this stems from ofc childhood i didnt care too much for looks as a kid i just wanted to have fun but my dad would constantly judge my hair want me to change my clothes so i can look better every thing was about appearances with him he would constantly look at himself even in windows while walking out in public hed spend hours getting dressed despite having no hair so i dont get what took so long i noticed ive picked up the same habits i care far too much for my appearance when logically i know most people dont care and if they do care thats kind of weird are you like this how does your appearance play into your avpd,3
is that weird when i look into the futureits black i cannot get myself to visualize my life past today it feels like im just floating all day with zero idea what i want for the next day ive been thinking this for about months now and just wanted to see if anyone can relate is this something i should worry about,3
in country where i live there were president elections and i didnt even know about it until i went to someone i know and they asked me who i think will win president elections it was already day after voting and they were just counting votes i acted like i knew about it but i didnt like i dont watch news or anything so i am out of loop in lots of things that are happening and i dont care much about politics honestly i also cant vote in this country because i am a foreigner here so thats another thing why i dont care about it much but fk the thing that president elections just slipped through without me even knowing about them i found this to be ridiculous because it is always such a big event how could i miss this i also missed usa president elections i am not usa citizen i live in europe i learned that biden is president year later sometime in summer after he was elected i still thought that trump was president lol i realized that i withdrawn from life too much but it wasnt even my choice it was also because of covid and that government forced us to just stay at home i isolated myself from other people for almost years and now i am trying to go out again and trying to put my life back together,3
im and soon to be due to childhood trauma abuse and neglect i grew very up lonely and to this day have never been in a relationship i tried online dating and met a few people unfortunately no one panned out while ill admit i wasnt interested in any of them i also just find myself feeling uncomfortable being with someone who knows your close personal life ive never really had a close relationship with anyone my whole life ive always been a loner and its been my comfort zone i fantasize and would just love to have a partner who i can spend time with but i have so little confidence and so worried about being judged that i just cant put in the effort to start a serious relationship im a weird loser with no friends and no hobbies even if i have a good career and ok life otherwise being close with someone else makes me feel so uncomfortable i also get exhausted by look at what it takes to maintain a relationship im hoping i can get over this one day anyone else feel the same way,3
from most posts i read here it seems like most of you had avoidant behavior since childhood and it was the same for me so considering you were avoidant since you were a child you probably had issues making friends since then so have you ever had someone you called your best friend and they called you their best friend too i had friend like this we were best friends for about years when i left for university then we stopped being in contact slowly we met few times after that but at this point i feel like we are not even friends anymore but he was my good friend i have to say he knew that i was shy and weird but he always called me out to meet with people,3
i just started working in my first job after finishing university and im constantly worried about getting fired i also constantly feel like my coworkers hate me im moving out into my first own apartment at the end of the month and im overwhelmed with all the things i have to take care of im most likely also not going to see my friends again after moving away and im scared of being lonely in the new place i also have to spend a lot of money on furniture and im worried about picking the wrong stuff additionally i have to make contracts for internet electricity etc and what if i dont like the apartment after moving in i wish i didnt have to make that many decisions,3
so when i was younger i knew perfectly well that my family had issues the only thing was that i thought that it was normal i looked at my parents divorce how poor my parents both were my mothers constant struggles with drugs mental health jobs and relationships and figured that there were more kids at school whos parents also divorced so what makes mine any different i kept going through life made basically no friends and in the fifth grade i moved parents i switched from living with my mother to living with my father it was strange as both parents had very different parenting styles my mother was more uninvolved due to her relationships mental health and other issues on the other hand my father is very authoritarian and often wasnt home as he spent his entire day at his office i dont want to keep going on about the messes that happened in my life because i feel like im just complaining at this point i just wish my family cared more its strange to think that after all the signs i showed my family did nothing they didnt stop and think something was wrong because they were so focused on everything else and after everything i did to try and help my family members too its like they never considered that i was hurting too when my brothers depression led him to be hospitalized why would nobody think that hurt me or when my dad lost his grandfather and he couldnt hold himself together i comforted him while my brother though given his condition i dont blame him remained distant theres plenty more too much that i did that someone else should have done children shouldnt have to be adults because their parents are too busy or naive to do it themselves i know im not giving much detail given some of the things ive mentioned so im sorry for that im just not ready to share those things yet i want nothing more than to leave my relatives behind and never look back because all i can remember is how they failed me and how i actually believed that they were good people until someone finally got close enough to me to see how bad my life was i still cant believe someone had to tell me these werent normal and that i did have bad parents i grew up not knowing that these bad things were actually bad i thought it was normal and maybe to some degree they are normal but definitely not all of it because i thought how i felt was normal and because when i did try to speak up i was invalidated by those relatives who had also gone through something just because i could hide my pain better than them didnt mean they were hurting worse than i was but it sure made them feel that way i wanted so badly to be different than everyone else because of this i saw people who were hurting who thought that i was normal so i didnt want to end up like them if what i was was normal then i promised myself i would watch the mistakes my relatives made and not copy them i would be someone different someone people would like because i had it all togetherunder control but i didnt i was just hiding i wanted so badly to be someone special because maybe then i would feel wanted or accepted and now because of that it hurts me deeply when people say my condition is normal i just cant bring myself to believe that this is normal that everyone feels like this it makes me feel so weak and pathetic thats why i hid because if i did try to show people that i was hurting then they would just brush me off and invalidate me again i wanted to be special and now to some degree i guess i am but i dont even know if i want to be without this condition why would anyone care about me but with this condition it wouldnt matter if they did anyway ill have so much trouble just trying to accept that someone actually wants to be near me for some reason of everything that i want i want just a few things i want to move far away from my family and never see them again so i dont have to be reminded of my past i want to be a better person whos past doesnt define them that way i can be myself and be okay around other people and lastly if i can get those other two things then i want to be in a relationship with nice woman someone who will support me and understand that im not always going to be okay but ill still try my best to support her of course theres more to a relationship than that but having someone who can be empathetic with me is definitely something im looking for well thats it for now i want to apologize for this being so long and uncoordinated i hope this doesnt make anyone feel bad i know theres a bunch of negative things in this and im sorry about that i really hope yall are doing well,3
this has been going on since i was a child a friend or family member doesnt answer my call and after a half hour i start to worry that they dont care about me anymore im an extremely logical person but cant help following that sinking emotion that has me analyzing all these dooming scenarios that leaves me wondering if i said something that pissed them off or if they figured something out about our relationship and decided to move on i know better but have never been able to relieve myself i guess i just cant help but to feed the worry over believing in myself and the people close to me,3

im a year old cc student and i live with my grandma mom uncle aunt and little sister my mom has a meth addiction and shes developed schizophrenia from it and its been getting worse as the years go on my uncle was hit on the head at a young age and im not exactly sure what he struggles since we never talk but i think its schizophrenia my mom doesnt take her meds i think and my grandma is constantly trying to help her with moving in and out of motels and rehabs and all this stuff for the past months or so realistically shes been trying to help her for many many years now but my mom had moved out recently my mom moved back in like a week ago my uncle is very strange and i dont know really anything about him he leaves his room a few times a day and doesnt talk to anyone sometimes i hear him talk to himself in his room but he doesnt yell and scream like my mom does hes just very quiet and intense so earlier tonight i was using my grandmas phone for school since mine was dead and i got curious to look in her messages between my mom because ive seen messages between them before where my mom is talking about how she hears voices talking about someone wanting to kill me and how shes constantly was thinking about me and she doesnt think im safe so i looked and my aunt shes mentally well sent my grandma a picture where she found a big butcher knife placed on top of a picture of me the message said uncles name is acting strange again i asked moms name if she did this and she said she didnt does uncles name know what it means to stab someone that they will die in the photo my aunt sent my grandma the picture of me was in like a mouse pad that was custom made with a photo of me from th grade the thing is im not sure if its a coincidence because the mouse pad is on a desk for like where a computer used to be but the desk in like directly connected to the kitchen like almost next to it so it could be possible that someone had happened to place that knife there so i didnt really freak out but i talked to some friends and when i kinda said it out loud to them i did kinda realize like damn that does kinda sound bad and they told me that yea its probably not safe i dont know if it was my uncle or mom either though if it even was intentional my uncle used to come home and hit me in the head as a kid a lot and we would yell and scream at each other we lived together for like years and this would happen then we moved then we moved again and he moved back in with us but ever since we moved back in again we literally do not talk to each other at all hes very awkward around me and everyone tbh and quiet and i can tell he doesnt like to be in the same room as me even though i do not interact with him at all whatsoever weve said hey to each other like less than times over the years and thats about it he does kinda seem like he hates me but i dont think he would want to kill me on the other hand its possible that my mom was lying to my aunt but from what ive seen i dont think my mom wants to kill me either whenever she has talked about me in that way its more of a this is my son i need to protect him from whoever gonna kill him type of way rather than a malicious tone but again they are both schizophrenic which i really dont know much about besides they can be unpredictable and so thats why im asking i know its weird to ask about this on reddit but i really dont have anyone to talk to about it im not going to directly confront my uncle about it because again we are very distant and hes a big guy i just dont want to i feel like itd be worse and i dont want to ask my mom because i know she would say no even if she did im going to ask my grandma tomorrow since i havent been able to since shes been asleep all night but shes just going to ignore me after i express my concerns which she always does i can talk to my aunt about it even though were not really too close but yeah another thing is my grandma sent the photo my aunt sent her to my uncle asking if he did it and he kind of just ignored it didnt deny it so but yea i cant really move out or anything i dont have the money for that since i just graduated high school and honestly i dont have a job right now since im a full time student and i just dont know where i would go i dont have any friends that would let me live with them either so thats out of the picture the best thing im hoping for is the convince my grandma to have them move out but thatll probably never happen even though i want it to so bad i just dont know if this is a coincidence with the knife and i shouldnt be worried or what i should do so yea pls help,4

i think ever since i was bullied in school i always was afraid of people i missed so many opportunities in my life because no matter how many self help books i was reading i was just not able to overcome my anxiety and even if i managed to be normal around people i still felt lonely because i felt like an alien like i was different to everyone else a normal relationship with a woman who accepts me for who i am gt not available since i finished school friends with whom i can share my hopes and dreams and who i feel deeply connected with gt not for me just interact with people without feeling completely nervous and socially awkward gt impossible with i knew that either i have to change something or it will stay like this forever it was a wild journey ever since and despite a lot of set backs rejections insecurities and the feeling that i am too unlovable for anyone i can say that i overcame my social anxiety i dont want to brag with this post the only thing i want is to give you hope in times where you maybe feel no hope maybe this here is the motivation for you to take the first step today to look out of the comfort zone a tiny little bit to get help when you need help as it is a sign of strength to ask for help not of weakness if this here reaches one person who is struggling today ive done my job because no matter how tall the wall seem that you are looking at right now it is possible to overcome it if you need help or advice ill be there for you in the comments,4
ive been taking the same adhd pill since i was a very small child and i had to switch on weekends due to a shortage i have some history with certain pills and their side effects which is why i am so anxious not the average side effects either the that most people dont get the side effects were facial and tongue cramping due to a severe allergic reaction slurred speech throat swelling and a tic like thing called tardive dyskinesia i am having waves of panic attacks but i am so fucking proud of myself i faced my fear i took the pill i did it i faced my anxiety this is a first as i usually cower to it my anxiety is still going but its not used to me challenging it,4
every single day i feel the life inside of me just fall down as if it were sand every day i feel like i cant breathe i just sit and look around because even though no one sees it i feel like my lings are vomiting inside me every single day i want to kill myself while at the same time having a panic attack because i dont want to die and then i just sit there not bothering anyone because no one can look at me and tell me my intestines are silently spinning no one can look at me and see my heart beating way too fast and know im not breathing and certainly no one knows that every fucking day while i try to live my life i see myself in a grave not feeling any physical sensation at all its almost as if i can see the future almost as if old me is sitting in bed slowly rotting away dead and no one has checked up on me for several hours why tf am i like this im im supposed to enjoy life but insead i hate this shit and i hate living with this terrible anxiety about nothing and everything at the same time not living because i dont wanna die which makes me want to kill myself the worst part is im not even diagnosed with an anxiety disorder because im too scared to talk to anyone about it and so no one will ever know because i dont know people well enough to tell them this i guess i dont mind sharing with strangers online tho hope you have a nice day and i hope your anxiety gets better because i wish no ine had to suffer like this,4
i dont know how to explain it but the last week or two i have been in a constant panic mode always on edge i feel sick crying etc but nothing has triggered me i just woke up one day and i knew something wasnt right in my brain i just felt really fuzzy and confused and now two weeks later im in a constant fight or flight mode,4
ive been undergoing therapy for anxiety and depression for the past two months my therapist recommended that i start keeping a thought diary to write down any worries or concerns that i may have and to practice a breathing technique that involves breathing in for four seconds holding for two and then exhaling for four seconds initially i was skeptical that these simple practices could make a difference in something that has troubled me for years however i began to notice that whenever i started to become consumed by anxious or depressive thoughts jotting them down in my diary helped me immensely this process allowed me to break down those thoughts and identify that of the time my worries and depression stem from hypothetical situations for instance one of my thoughts was what if my friends are judging me behind my back for context this was after we went out for drinks the key phrase in that being what if meaning its just hypothetical with no real evidence to back up the worry so in my thought diary alongside my worrisome thought i would write down a helpful thought where i deconstruct this worry for the aforementioned thought my helpful thought was this is a hypothetical worry you have no evidence to suggest this will happen your friends opinion of you shouldnt be taken seriously anyway you dont need to seek approval from your friends of course this may not help everyone but i wanted to share how thought diaries have helped my mental health and they can be quite powerful tldr my therapist recommended keeping a thought diary and practicing breathing techniques to help my anxiety and depression writing down my thoughts and using the breathing technique has helped me identify that of my worries are hypothetical i recommend trying it out,4

be patient with yourself its okay to say no you are experiencing your life nobody knows how you feel your feelings are valid and its okay to set boundaries its okay if you cant do it today it takes a lot of energy for you to always fight against your worries and anxiety so its totally understandable if you need some space and peace dont surround yourself with people that drain your energy its okay to let them go this gives you more energy to focus on the good people and things in your life i hope you have a good day today but also dont have too much expectations its totally fine if not everything is going to work out today,4
long story short trying to book a trip away and of the keep taking all suggestions and twistingchanging other have got fed up and just let them plan it their way i get so anxious and stressed when planning stuff anyway because im a control freak maybe ocd about it and the thought that they get their own way everytime just cause the rest dont want an argument really annoys me but i dont know why any advice or just friendly support welcome,4
hello ive been suffering with anxiety and panic attacks my whole life and while i take a ridiculous amount of meds for it including lorazapam pregablin etc i was informed about magnesium and i wanted to share this with you so a lot of us get anxiety attacks triggered by the stress hormone cortisol magnesium works by by stimulating the production of melatonin and serotonin which boost your mood and help you sleep magnesium also reduces the production of cytokines and cortisol which lead to increased inflammation and stress its important that you dont over do it as you can poison yourself with magnesium and you also have to make sure its aspartate citrate lactate and chloride forms as oxide apparently doesnt absorb as well speak to your pharmacist or dr if youre mixing medication but i have been able to reduce the amount of lorazapam ive needed since starting mag and its helped a lot with sleep im truly impressed,4
i was wondering if anybody has had nausea with one ssri but not with some other one i am taking zoloft and nausea is pretty bad even with the one half of mg tablet i dont know if switching ssris would be beneficial or this side effect would remain the same what is interesting is that i have taken zoloft yeras ago with absolutely no issues at at all and now i feel like i am taking a poison i dont understand this at all thanks,4
lately ive been having this massively irrational fear of my food being laced with lsd or some other form of psychedelics i wont eat something thats been already opened regardless of whether or not its mine which has led to me not only wasting food but actively avoiding eating unless i make it right there and even then it takes quite a bit of effort this in turn has also led me to having a fear of an undiagnosed mental illness and i cant quite afford to go to a doctor currently to figure out if that is the case ive only ever been technically drugged once when the cannabis my friend bought was laced with pcp a few months ago but this fear extends back to when i was around fifteen twenty three now ive done acid only twice and while i did enjoy it its not something im likely to do again and i rarely smoke cannabis or drink but i did do a lot of both for a few years obviously nobody is gonna waste good acid on me but the fear is constantly there to the point that i yelled at my brother the other day for jokingly pretending to drop something into my gatorade on the way to work hes unaware of this fear and threw it away despite it being completely full and even avoided eating the cookies my mom brought down for christmas which made me feel awful as there is absolutely no way my mom would ever do anything like that to me im iffy on telling anybody close to me about this fear for a few reasons the main one being the irrationality of it all but i also do not want to be sent to an inpatient center again cant afford it as i was for depression as a minor sorry for the rambling wall of text but i just need to know if this is signs of a more major illness or at the very least how i can possibly cope with it,4
i have hurry sickness and its linked to my anxiety and bpd it causes me so much anxiety because i always feel like i need to do many things at the same time or short period of time i drink my coffee in about minutes then i read a book for an hour then i listen to music and surf the web for a nonspecific reason everything has to be done very fast and wellplanned if not i get impatient irritable and anxious its pretty exhausting and i realized its a problem going on for two years now i did not pay too much attention to this before since i didnt even know there was a term for this condition does anyone else experience something similar how are you dealing with it,4

hi just wondering if anybody knows about if doctors think you are drug seeking do they put that on your record i went to doctors yesterday didnt see my usual gp it was about spinal pain that radiates up my back only seems to hurt after physical activity which is weird but concerning to me the day before appointment i went gym amp done some light training on back muscles which really set it off was painful amp felt weird afterwards like weakness in my arms bit dizzy and just a general weak feeling like really weak and disorientated she was not helpful at all basically done a quick ops check checked my back briefly amp said it seems ok she said to rest on weekend and see how i go she said hot water bottle the more im thinking about my appointment with a her yesterday i get the impression she feels i was drug seeking i never asked for any drugs but i feel she was misunderstanding me being concerned with trying to get drugs she said something when i sat down like youre looking to discuss pain management i didnt really take it in as was really anxious and tired so i said yeah about my spine then proceeded to talk about my concerns but not once did i say anything about wanting medicationsdrugs im annoyed now i should of been clear that i would of liked a referral to be checked out or something im on pregabalin for anxiety it also just happens to be a nerve pain drug and she said few times about youll have review soon with usual gp to see if its helping my anxiety and not just about pain management she also said youve only upped dosage days ago i didnt really take it in properly at the time but i feel she thinks i was trying to up my dose or get pain meds im worried now that it will be on my notes and im also frustrated that i didnt correct her properly any advice or help on this would be appreciated im very anxious about this i feel i was totally misunderstood and i dont like the thought of her putting on notes i was looking for pain management or medication to help that i also noticed as i was leaving she done a frustrated sigh this experience has made me feel invalidated misunderstood and made my anxiety and depression worse im struggling mentally very very bad to say the least,4

greetings people i hope youre having a good day first of all how are your experiences with coffee and antipsychotic meds ive been on abilify and alprazolam for years never had been feeling alert on them always either sleepy or have weird feeling in my stomach now ive tried everything with these meds be it smoking or alcohol i stopped all of it because it caused very nasty problems with me when i stopped i finally felt myself even through ive read on wikipedia that coffee can also cause problems when you take these meds its says even small amounts can cause side effects thats called caffeine induced anxiety im not really sure how am i supposed to be awake i mean im unemployed still in hands of my parents and other family members who take care of me and understand my problems but how did you manage to stay awake without coffee or did coffee really help you without feeling weird all time while on meds it would be stupid for me to sleep all day and miss some important events or have fun chatting with friends or playing video games or better yet studying different topics like electrical engineering or making homemade circuits not electrical engineer just doing something for hobby,4
i have a question so when i am out in public i feel like everyone is looking at me but then i start feeling like im in a dream like a lucid dream i can but i feel like i cant think thoughts and only focus on doing what im supposed to do i also feel like my head is fogged up inside too in public lol im not the happiest person to be honest and since maybe half a year ago ive stopped caring abt things and when i think of something and it gets a little complicated i just quit thinking abt it i dont care enough to think about anything for some reason can someone please tell me if its anxiety or is there something wrong with me,4
i know its contradictory but yeah not sure if this has to do with being a perfectionist or if its something else i enjoy the rush of learning new things and knowing things but when it push comes to shove and i need to practice what im learning thats when i usually find out i still have a long way to go and will have to fail and make mistakes and actually suck at that thing for a while its like i just want to skip to the good part i feel like the work is only productiveuseful when its good how do you even deal with the uncomfortable parts of learning and growing i just keep pushing on but sometimes it feels like im making no progress at all and i know that slow progress is still progress but then my anxiety kicks in with bullsht like other people are staying up and working their asses off while youre celebrating a tiny step forward,4
i used propranolol for anxiety and stress but i quitted after weeks because i had too much side effects the day i began too lower my dosage untill stopping i have experienced excessive sweating around my sit area and by that i mean abnormally much is this something related to betablockers and has anyone had a similair experience with this,4
ive been dealing with some anxiety issues my whole life ive had lots of trama and was diagnosed with adhd as a young child never being able to focus and always the most loud and distributive in school i used to stay up at night as a kid because after watching the slightest scary movie i would be afraid anyways the point of the backstory is to give you a sense of who i was lately within the past year my anxiety has been through the roof i find it very hard to focus and have lots of thoughts at once even some that just pop into my head i can hear other peoples tone of voice not like big conversation my anxiety was so high i was getting lots of physical symptoms heart palpitations chest pain shortness of breath to which i thought i had a heart problem so i went to the doctors and got all the tests and didnt believe my heart was fine until i got the results i thought about this everyday to which now i think this might had been a delusion my point is im very worried im developing schizophrenia my family does have a history of mental health issuesi know this post is confusing and if im worried about my mental health i should see a doctor but im just looking for advice edit i would like to add that for a long time when i went home after a long day i could not relax to fall asleep my mind would be racing the only way i could describe it is like a radio in order to drown it out i would have to put on music to fall asleep,4
i do have a check up appointment with the doctor next week but im nervous maybe its not working for me,4

ive been dealing with anxiety for a while now i came to the realisation a few years ago that it has mainly stemmed from the relationship with my dad i had when i was younger this is caused me to not be able to do tasks in front of people wether they be simple or not i just cant do it i start lightly trembling and thinking about how stupid i must look to whoever is watching me this causes me to mess up even more this is really stopped me from wanting to go out and get a job because i know that if the interview goes well i actually do good in interviews weirdly then i will eventually have to be shadowed and critiqued by someone while i learn the job this dread has stopped me from going to interviews now does anyone else get this sorry for the long post,4
ive been dealing with a really complex personal issue involving heartbreak loss of a person i deeply care about certainly the worst pain ive experienced in my life thus far as it stands i already carry a level of anxiety with me but with this added on to it my body has been putting me through hell i find myself dry heaving hard in the mornings especially and then at times throughout the day this has led to some really painful vomiting on several occasions its also occurred at my workplace the gym and several other public places without warning i know theres absolutely a psychosomatic part of all of this but after almost three weeks its becoming really problematic for me has anyone experienced something similar is this just something i have to power through are there any tricks to at least minimize it,4
anyone up or available im just not doing good right now my anxiety has me feeling like i cant breath and making me feel like my throat is gonna close yea wierd i know,4
im a year old female ive probably had anxiety all my life but have never spoken to a doctor or anyone about it i feel like im just always in a constant state of worry so much so that it drives me to have small ocd traits something as simple as fearing a house fire and having to do a series of steps checking lights before i leave the house over and overand over again its weird im always worrying about the future past things i cant change things i say or do after im with people how people view me if i have a too much gene ill sit and agonize over things thats so mild for someone to worry about but drives me up a wall to the point of frustration where i just lose it and cry into a panic i dont even know where to start to solve this i feel like the past year its been horrendous and getting increasingly worse im good at playing it off im good at putting on a show because ive always thought i could handle it lots of people i know feel the same but its really starting to take a toll on my life and the things im doing or too afraid to even try to do i feel like i use alcohol and drugs as a way to cope sometimes not an outrageous amount but ill have a big drinking night and then will go a week without drinking cause ive worried myself into thinking i have a problem and need self control im so good at people pleasing and acting like everything is fine but i feel like my mind is just in a dark place telling myself ill never make it that ill always be alone etc its really stupid things to stress over or at least stupid things to let myself worry about for more than a minute money is always a bug stress factor for everyone of course but thats the main reason i think ive never gone to get help im not sure how much it cost to afford the help i need or where to even go not to mention the fear i get trying to explain how i feel to someone and them thinking im crazy or im making it up how sad to think a professional in this field would judge me i just feel like if i dont try to improve my overall mindset towards life then i wont have a fulfilling one ill be too afraid to try new things that scare me ill stick to my same safe routine and ill come home and cry over the big and small worries that run through my head daily where i do i start to fix this,4
on the one hand its comforting to know that all of my worries about coming across as nervous or awkward are so out of proportion that people dont even know i have anxiety on the other hand it feels sort of invalidating to my struggle if that makes sense this thing often consumes my life and its frustrating that no one knows how hard im trying they just think this is easy for me that i can effortlessly raise my hand and speak in class like other people do thats not to say that i feel negatively toward the people who say this more that its just generally frustrating that people have no idea have yall thought about this too do you look at it a different way,4
sounds stupid but whenever i feel my anxiety go through the roof and make me nauseunauseouss mcdonalds fries always help ground me for whatever reason,4
a bit of background i was diagnosed with ocd and gad about years ago been very much under control for the most part im years old and just started dating an incredible year old woman about a month ago ive dated a lot over the past few years but this is the first time in ages where ive really been into the person normally it feels like the people i date like me more than i like them and anxiety doesnt play a role i just go about my day with a calm mind and do what needs to be done but now it feels like the roles are reversed and im getting crushed constant thoughts of whether or not she likes me obsessing over every word in her texts to try interpreting meaning freaking out if shes doesnt respond to my messages within a couple hours its taking over my life my work is slipping i cant sleep well a constant awful sick panicked feeling in the pit of my stomach it doesnt help that shes very reticent with her emotions and does not offer much words of affection or validation but i dont want to scare her off with my intense feelings so on the surface ive been playing it cool the best i can i almost wish she would just end things with me so i could move on because not knowing how she feels is the worst part i dont know what to do,4
this technique helped me to develop awareness of my thoughts and feelings as observer also it helped me to heal my anxiety and neurosis i call this back of head method i hope you try it and it works if your attempt was successful and you started feeling calmness and ease i recommend you to regularly practice this method for months to get good results you wont even recognize your reaction to impulses after long practice,4
i just started a new job that has the absolute best work environment ever however its answering phones and of course thats not ideal for me the sheer amount of information i have to navigate is overwhelming every question is entirely unique and im beginning to feel really stupid and out of sorts its not rocket science just selling hotel rooms any advice on how to stay calm and collected,4
so the preface im someone in my early twenties living with my parents my parents have been fighting for years occasionally physically this would usually include my mom knocking in my dads door to argue with him these arguments would usually start with topics that included bills taxes or myself that would eventually escalate to more personal matters i will not get into too much here i used to try to intervene when things got too heated since they cant stop themselves but recently i have decided not to so anymore as the last time i tried to intervene my mom did physically attack me i didnt get hurt i was just standing in front of my dad and she lurched at me last night she called me to ask if i could knock on my dads door since he wasnt responding to her calls because she needed to pay a bill i knew that this wasnt just about a bill so i compromised and sent him a text instead i even sent her a screenshot as proof and i wasnt going to call himwake him up in the middle of the night unless it was an emergency as i would consider it to be rude to do so she then says dont worry your little head about go back to sleep or whatever okay then she called me again this time saying what are the consequences gonna be knock on the fucking door i declined saying i dont want to be a part of whatever was going on between them and she should talk to him about this to which she said i know hes your loving dad and im the evil mom i said goodnight to her she laughs and responded with not goodnight good bye i say that i will talk to her tomorrow and she replies ill never talk to you again not tomorrow not the next day or the next she then calls me twice then immediately hangs up she calls me one more time that night here are the things she said when i declined to knock on my dads door again i ask you to do one simple thing and you didnt do it its just a simple thing i tried calling your dad and he isnt answering me its not like youre picking sides or anything translation look at what i do for you and yet you cant this simple task for me well then i will rescind my love for you its not like youre picking sides or anything youre full of shit just like him my dad where has your dad been all of your life you need to take responsibility is this what one of your councilors told you to say the one that i pay x amount of money i dont exactly remember you dont even know what is going on but fine you can do whatever go to sleep wake up in the morning do whatever you do me ok goodnight mom and finally i said goodnight to her and she said dont call me mom just say good night thats not to say my dads innocent either or anything hes hella toxic and has treated my mom poorly as well so it is hard to tell where the abuse and victimization starts and ends between the two of them basically theyre both each others abusers and victims if that makes any sense at all but i do believe he is the safer parent as although he can at his worst make me feel very uncomfortable to be around him as he is kind of an asshole at times i dont feel like my safety is threatened around him unlike with my mom hes a lesser of two evils if you will so i just feel really anxious right now i did not want to be used as a pawn against dad and my mom immediately associated me with him so now im afraid that when she comes home she will start to treat exactly like she treats dad or worse im afraid she might start pounding my door and attacking verbally and physically okay that is all i just needed to vent thank you for reading this,4
im becoming numb and i dont feel like talking to anyone im not diagnosed with anxiety but i know i have it even being aware i dont feel better it sucks im a good person i dont say that a lot but i am why is this happening to me overthinking every stupid thing nailbiting the constant hatred for myself and others it doesnt help as a kid ive always known that something is wrong with me but im too scared to tell my parents because if its confirmed it means im sick i am not okay and i want help but im so used to being the person who helps not being helped i always put on a fake smile and am never in a bad mood no one suspects it i feel so alone i should be used to it but ever since ive got friends i want to spend time with them it doesnt help because we have a huge fight and i keep overthinking it i wanted to feel better because i somehow convince myself my feelings are fake and that im doing it for attention so i took a pathology test and the result was too much for me the questions felt so attacking and my stomach hurt every time i clicked a yes or a no the result was that it is sure i have anxiety my stomach dropped seeing that while i was happy i was right at some point i felt retarded that realization that is actually something wrong with me was horrifying i dont mean to degrade anyone but i felt horrible,4
i cant for the life of me talk to people i instantly think that if i talk to them ill annoy them i feel like a burden if i do talk about how i feel but if i dont then i get told to talk about my feelings even talking to someone in passing is terrible i put words together in my head but i say something completely different,4
everyday i overthink things and make myself anxious by doing so thoughts like are they talking about me do they hate me am i doing this right and stuff like that a lot of thoughts are just me being anxious that im a horrible person what can i do to decreasehave better reactions to these anxious thoughts,4
having bad anxiety over my tongue i have on the side of my tongue this white thing and i tried getting it out but its hard and im having anxiety over what it can be ive never seen this before if anyone can relate please,4
if so what are your thoughts i like it so far but mostly just because it triggers my asmr did you have success,4
ok so kinda a weird post and im not sure if it belongs here but i figured this sub was probably the best one for it i also tried the social anxiety sub but my post was instantly removed so basically i have this huge fear of asking my mom for things because i think she will judge me for them i dont have this fear around anyone else i couldnt care less what anyone else thinks of me but for some reason i have it with her im not talking about little things like asking for something at the store or asking for basically any necessity im talking about bigger things like hair dye piercings or really anything to do with clothing for example recently i worked up the confident to ask her over text if i could dye my hair which she is fine with however later that day when she asked me to show her pictures of what i want i chickened out and got to scared to show her its like i knew she would say yes but i was still to scared to show her because i was afraid shed say something judgmental to me she has always been sorta judgmental towards me but i really want to get over this fear because it prevents me from getting a lot of the things i really want is there anything i can do,4
hello everyone i hope youre okay i was just playing fifa and boom a big palpitation hit i started to panic felt lightheaded because i was holding my breath because i was so tense and then calmed down i have had my heart checked times of which are private best testing ones and its perfect so i know its not going to harm me but still catches me off guard i think its more of the fact i was leaning forward that it felt harder and the fact i was breathing in lol anyway i was laying in bed thinking i need to just once and for all get over all of the symptoms that are making me scared of being ill and dying how can i do that get over my fear of dying now im not saying im perfectly fine with death because i am not but i just thought to myself i cant stop death and i just need to accept it if there isnt a god i wont know about dying after if there is a god i could go to heaven which is great and who knows i could reincarnate and live life again we dont know so its the anxiety of not knowing which scares me and leaving my family behind like i say im a healthy year old male with no health conditions death can happen at anytime and could happen the next minute but for my age and health it is unlikely but never zero now im religious and i am sort of anxious in my mind that god is trying to get me to accept death so i can die soon lol but i dont wanna die soon thats why im scared off thats just my anxious mind thinking right i guess the positive way of looking at it is that god is getting me to get over my fear of death so i can live the long happy healthy life that he put out for me can anyone help me accept death even more,4
going through a really challenging situation atm and its made me realise ive been avoiding tough feelings for a long time maybe all my life now that i see this am trying to just let them flow and breathe through it but its really really hard and it hurts and is scary and my avoidance habits are strong ill keep trying but if anyone has any advice experience with this that you can share the support would be very welcome,4
hey ranxiety i am in a very tough spot rn i was working towards becoming a teacher for years started my teaching certification programme in my country you need to do this but after weeks i was so anxious of all the people i constantly had to deal with that i started suffering from constant belly pain diarrhea insomnia so after spending weeks on sick leave i decided i want to quit and try to focus on my mental health first and maybe find a small job like a h job in order to be slowly introduced into regular work life while getting support from therapy and social services the h job idea was from my therapist because i havent had a job except for a summer job when i was which was very traumatic because the boss constantly berated me made fun of me and humiliated me i still live with my parents who have financially supported me throughout my studies tho till i was my health insurance was free and they got tax benefits and child benefits from me still living with them if i had moved out i would have been entitled to support by them my divorced father had to pay me a month for instance and to them me quitting because i just cant work with children and a ton of colleagues and the constant stress of being judged and evaluated and dealing with maladjusted kids supposedly is understandable however they demand of me to immediately get a fulltime or hour job so i can move out asap in potentially a field i have little experience in and they say i shouldnt become unemployed and rely on social services because it would look bad on my cv because i was struggling to find a field that would interest me within a week of deciding to quit teaching and me offering to apply for a h job at a library smth i wanted to do before but my applications failed sadly as a transitionary period my mother basically screamed daily at me the last couple days saying i should get a job and gtfo and stop acting like a child when i started crying shaking and feeling like i was about to throw up she says she is entitled to her financial support paying off after all this time and that i should get a job like a normal person and support myself as a result of this constant yelling and screaming and ranting i havent been able to sleep for days i have lost kg of weight lack any appetite have to get up every night cus of diarrhea and havent slept more than hours most nights yday i proposed the idea with the hour job and my mother reacted as if i was telling her a bad joke and said i should be ashamed for even suggesting such a thing in her rage she said i should gtfo she doesnt care if its social housing or a homeless shelter and that she didnt financially support me to become a workshy leech so in my panic i phoned a bunch of social services just in case so i would know my options today she came in tears to me and said she was just very concerned about my future yday i talked to my doctor and my therapist about the potentiality of getting kicked out and they asked if i could go somewhere to get away from this situation so i can recover a bit like i was supposed to during my sick leave so i decided today to leave for my boyfriends place who is still a student and also lives with his parents but in a different country we are in eu so travelling is no problem i have some money left from my teaching job that i could give them if they ask for it i was paying my fam a month from the teacher pay so i wouldnt be freeloading while i stay there i have been taking sertraline zoloft for a few weeks now but have had very little success i have been in therapy since november and been on sick leave since late february i think if i had stayed i would have become suicidal as i was noticing myself starting to go numb and dissociate whenever i was being yelled at after explaining my situation to my doctor she said she couldnt let me leave without asking if i have sucidial thoughts because in that case she would have recommended sending me to a clinic some questions are plagueing me now however am i a coward am i doing the right thing am i a lazy leech like my parents call me or just too mentally ill to work a proper job for now what do you guys think about my situation am i doing the right thing what should i have done in your opinion kind of asking as a reality check,4
whenever i open up and share my feelings my body feels physically sick and exhausted like it physically hurts i feel so vulnerable like an open wound i basically start shaking and feel nauseous whenever i do share myself im terrified of opening up whenever i do ill just get shamed or ghosted it feels like hell because its hard enough to put myself out there in the first place its not even just deep stuff whenever i simply text someone i worry im bothering them and feel really embarrassed im afraid of getting close to new people because what if they end up changing their minds get bored and ghost me im afraid of being forgotten about,4

im wondering if anyone else ever has this usually when i breathe out or push on it it starts to get tickly more so when i think about it ive gotten an ekg done a few days ago and it came back normal so i guess that helps ease my mind a little bit i told the doctor ive been having chest pains and she told me it was costochondritis because it hurt when she pressed on my chest i guess it would calm me down more if someone could relate,4

i have a crippling anxiety disorder and ive been prescribed lexapro i have gad but ive noticed my anxiety has always been around my health especially my heart its gotten so bad that i barely leave the house and im afraid to exert myself which is depressing because i used to be a gym rat and exercising was what i used to do help cope with my anxiety but thats not something i can do anymore atleast in my mind i cant this has really intensified over this past year after dealing with multiple panic attacks that have landed me in the er and ive been getting a bunch of physical symptoms constantly that does not help with my worrying ive had many tests done and the doctors are very reassured that im healthy my doc believes the lexapro will help me but i cant seem to find the courage to take it im just so terrified of it id really appreciate some encouragement to start my meds because i high key hate living like this,4
i felt like my anxiety had gotten worse lately and that i had gone backwards this made me feel extremely discouraged and a sense of doom until i saw this quote i wanted to share in hopes that it will help others too dont be so harsh on yourself anxiety is a curse that i wouldnt wish on my worst enemy if i had any lol take care x,4
the last month has been such a struggle for me i started having panic attacks where my heart rate would spike to i went to my doctor in case it wasnt anxiety and just had my holter monitor results come back i had one of these attacks while on it and thankfully no dangerous rhythms were found just some high rates but not sustained so my doctor is unconcerned so once again this is all anxiety my therapist thinks its because i started a new job last month and im falling back into my old health anxiety habits because stress compounds symptoms this has gotten so bad that the past week i havent even been able to leave my bed out of fear of my heart getting too high due to probably the fear when i cooked or did dishes my heart rate could get up to then if i noticed and began to worry it went up to now that i know im fine i thought id be okay but im still constantly watching my smart watch to see how high my heart rate gets then panicking when i see it go above from just walking around the house but when im calm it doesnt go over like this happened on the holter and it was normal i know this is just anxiety but i cant stop obsessing that i have a heart issue thatll kill me i just need help to take the smart watch off and stop taking my blood pressure its just making everything worse yesterday alone according to my logs i took my blood pressure times i was worried because my bp was low when standing yet my heart rate was high so i thought it was dangerous it happened again this morning and my heart rate got to this constant checking is driving me crazy and ruining my life how do i stop this,4
any time i get my bp taken its always high as im basically on the verge of a panic attack i know its going to be high bc i get nervous thatll be high and quite honestly im a fit guy with big arms so the cuff always gets uncomfortably tight which makes me more nervous and turn i know that means well have a convo about my high bp again which is what i was dreading in the first place so fellow anxiety suffers do you have any tips to combat white coat bp,4
ive had anxiety for years but no panic attacks in yeaaaaaars however panic attacks have returned in the last weeks and theyre awful i forgot how bad they are ive been reading deep breathing and breath work doesnt super help and i know that to be true but what else do you do during one do you just focus on your breathing however it is how do you calm down the panic attack the physical symptoms are awful,4
ive noticed that over the last year ive become super anxious when it comes mine and my loved ones health i think its because my husband had bells palsy early last year since then anything will trigger me literally anything i was picking at a mole didnt realize and it started bleeding and got itchy and now i have this anxious feeling in my stomach even tho i know im the one who picked at it i feel like even though my brain is like yes u picked at u probably dont have anything to worry about that anxious feeling in my stomach is still there other times if i have a headache it goes to the worst outcome i make doc appts every so often but i also dont want to be that person who shows up so frequently for nothing and waste my docs time im really starting to feel hopeless and like im going to live with this anxious feeling forever i guess any advice,4
i was prescribed mg zoloft for anxiety and depression which i took for the first time last night what followed was the most excruciatingly painful and unbearable hours of my life i threw up anything i ate heart was pounding nonstop my entire body was numb and i couldnt sleep without being constantly woken up by stomach pain or nausea pretty much all the anxiety symptoms i normally get except all at once and multiplied x at certain points i honestly felt like i was about to die or pass out i know people say that it gets worse before it gets better but nothing could have prepared me for this i dont think im gonna take another dose until i can talk with my psychiatrist and be absolutely certain this wont happen again anyone else have a similar experience or am i just really fucking unlucky,4
im sorry but this is a long one its a bit of a weird story but im hoping that someone might be able to give me advice on what to do just over a month ago i female cashier got a new coworker male bagger at the grocery store i work at it took a while before we had a conversation together he was helping me and asked me what kind of music i like i was honest and said that i like most genres and that i sometimes enjoyed listening to s and s jazz music then he just kept talking about old music at me for the next few days and seemed to always be distracted when it came to work i dont like to talk much while im working because i feel like i mess up more when i do so i began to feel anxious about being around him since i didnt know how to tell him i didnt want the conversation to continue every time we saw each other then a few days ago he randomly asked me for my number in front of a bunch of customers while we were supposed to be working i had a bad experience the last time i gave my number out to someone the guy turned out to be a stalker who harassed me for weeks and told everyone that we were in a relationship when we werent wouldnt stop calling me tried to turn me against my family etc and i immediately felt freaked out about why this guy would want my number when we dont know each other at all it felt really inappropriate and unprofessional to me i told him that we were busy and shouldnt be having that conversation right then mainly because i didnt know how to say no in the moment and that we could talk when we were done helping customers but he continued to ask me repeatedly for throughout the next hour or so he ended up writing his number down at some point and gave it to me telling me when he was off that day and to immediately text him my number when he was off this is while i was talking to a customer once we were done with all of the customers i told him the truth that i didnt want to give him my number and how i had had bad experiences in the past that started with giving my number to a guy i barely knew he seemed to understand and then avoided me the rest of the day so i thought everything was going to be fine however the next day i started noticing that he seemed to be getting more clingy with me he wouldnt be focused on doing his job and would stick around me as much as possible he has a habit of sticking to my register instead of helping other cashiers like hes supposed to he also seems to get bothered if another bagger is helping me and he tries to take over bagging for me immediately i often notice him watching me from across the room every conversation we have is awkward i dont initiate them because i want him to leave me alone so i can work when hes not talking to me it seems like he isnt really talking to our other coworkers that much but then the other day i had a bit of a scary experience i was going on break and went to our break room he was in there and had headphones in so i didnt think he saw me after a few minutes i went to the bathroom across the hall when i came out a few minutes later the room was empty i suddenly hear loud footsteps running down the hall and he barges into the room halfyelling my name just to show me a song from the s for some reason im worried that he might have been waiting outside the bathroom for me which makes me kind of scared to be at work right now i dont like being alone with him today i spent the majority of my breaks hiding in the bathroom worried he might bother me if i went anywhere else i know that the anxiety i feel isnt healthy and i cant tell if im just paranoid from past experience or if there really could be a real issue here i dont know if i should talk to him a manager or hr about this i thought that maybe i should just say nothing and act less nice to him and see if he leaves me alone but im worried that it could just make things worse i could really use some advice if anyone has some because i really cant tell if hes just trying to be friendly and doesnt realize hes making me uncomfortable or if there is something potentially more creepy going on,4
i f am in my senior year of high school ive sort of always been anxious especially about people any time anything happens to someone i care about even a little bit i get such bad anxiety that i am often unable to focus on other things so as i said in high school when i first started high school life was a mess whats important to know is that i had just made a massive transition and had come out of the closet not a lot of support from family but thats okay in my particular hs we have a home room class and you have that teacher for home room for all years when i met my home room teacher she was incredibly kind for all years she continued to be this way she made cards for everyone birthday talked to me when i was rejected romantically for the first time and always listened we talked to each other while getting ready for the day nearly every day for the last two years this week shes been absent very strange then on wednesday she says in a slide prepared for the sub that shes out on medical leave for the next few weeks it wasnt planned you could tell from the way she talked in the slides of the previous days i find out that shes in the hospital but fine instantly im full of anxiety feeling like my soul was removed from my body im just worried like a lot i know shes fine as far as everyone knows i also led an effort for a get well soon card being given to her by another teacher shes friends with i dont really know how to just patiently wait for the weeks until she gets back id also like to say that i know shes fine my brain does not seem to feel the same way especially when im not actively doing something distracting tldr my teacher is sick and in the hospital and i have a strangely large amount of anxiety even though everyone says shes fine,4

to years ago i was diagnosed with gadptsd years ago i was diagnosed with adhd i have managed it all this time with no medicine and i have been fine with for the most part the only time my anxiety would rise a little bit is when it was triggered by stress which then i knew i just had to balance it out again well this month ended up with heighten anxiety due to an allergic reaction being around seafood one week later got a tooth pulled days later i was fussed at by an er doctor and then one week later after that i had anxiety reflux kick back so hard that it cause two days of back to back panic attacks my anxiety was so bad that i couldnt eat anything but rice and chicken no meds and being around doctors frighten me i couldnt manage to get myself out of that anxiety loop well i was finally about to get some hydroxyzine for as needed dosage weeks later my anxiety was down back to a manageable level but my fears were still there i took one mg pill in the evening i got an euphoria feeling and drowsiness the whole next day along with diarrhea then all my anxiety was gone i can eat food again without fear im not scared to take meds again this is the weirdest anxiety is the moment i have ever dealt with however im now pondering if with my anxiety reflux being kicked up it had my stomach and brain a relay lap so when i took the hydroxyzine it suppressed that nerve in my stomach and it help my stomach feel better and then which stop the relay cycle i guess that is something i will have to remember to ask my doctor,4
i went off anxiety medication months ago cut it cold turkey by accident i was never told otherwise thankfully had no withdrawals or anything i have severe severe severe health anxiety and i was doing really good up until a few months ago it started to get bad again but i was managing however the past weeks have been really really hard with my health anxiety and i knew i needed to finally get back on and im so happy to be back on i had some stomach issues and im freaking out i had blood in my stools and bad pains in my pelvis i also for the past months have had a dull ache in my upper left abdomen had some blood and stool tests and all was good today is day is taking my medication zoloft and i have a weird nauseating feeling in my throatchest it feels exactly like when you get super giddy and your chestthroat squeals with excitement but i dont feel excited i feel so anxious its almost like i have to gag or dry heave can the zoloft be causing this i had no side effects last time i was on it so its weird my anxiety is going crazy because im afraid it has to do with my other symptoms,4

most people are mentally and emotionally sane relatively at least they might claim that the worry is all in your head not understanding that your corporeal experience strongly suggests otherwise they might tell you to think positive because they dont have an inner voice that constantly gets drowned out by a huge stadium packed with negative objectors they might take it rather personally when socializing is the very least thing you want to do they could never imagine that them yapping on about their normal life drains your already depleted lifeenergy some of them might start all kinds of shit with you because they see you as a weak and opportune victim to unload their own shit towards never realizing theyre the real cowards some of them might truly want to help you out and tell you get therapy asap then you might see some random bureaucrat person completely devoid of empathy struggling to stay awake while you pour you heart of desperately looking for some kind of assistance assistance that usually comes in form of dubious drugs that only work at a hefty price by the way so they advice you to go see some private expensive experts unaware of the fact that your wallets suffers with you they like to imply that you just chill the f out and relax because they dont have that intrusive horrible horrible horrible encompassing joydevouring soulobliterating sucking painful torturous uneasy pit of dread stuck right in their stomach with racing thoughts to boot perhaps theyll make sly remarks on how you need to just grow up after all they dont know hows its like to think like an adult while emotionally reacting like a little fragile child scared to death they might say go the gym or be physically active and get some endorphins running to be fair is actually solid advice if you can muster the strength to go there off course they have their problems too the difference however is that your problem is you and how that you contaminate every aspect of your life the point is according to some of them youre just a loser useless lazy afraid a waste of space a failure with nothing to show for in life they are so much better than you and intentionally or not they make you buy their version of you however its just opinions from judgemental people at the end of the day i dont want to you to waste any energy on harboring any resentment envy or anger towards anybody they just dont understand how could they know the truth perhaps even you dont the truth about yourself so im going to say it just in case you simply being here and keeping on makes you a tough as nails a warrior that fights hordes of demons every day bravery is defined by the will to face fear you have fear stuffed in your face all the time you may suffer endless anxiety but you as a matter of fact are courageous by the definition of the word doing your best to just keep going thats it its not some lofty motivational speech just a cold fact it may not help you any bit to read this but i for one will not let it be unsaid anxiety is bad enough in itself so rather than feeling shame in addition you have earned the right to have pride in yourself my intention is for you to keep that in mind on your darkest days because i know very well what its like to suffer anxiety while having your character measured by factors out of your control,4
i am absolutely spiraling about some things that happened today and i am very anxious about some things thatll happen in the next months today my anxiety has reached its new peak i am extremely nauseous lightheaded and it feels like theres a thousand butterflies in my chest it feels like im about to pass out from anxiety and i dont know how to calm myself down ive tried to distract myself but it doesnt work what can i do,4
my partner has lied to me in the past and now anything that is remotely close to that topic makes me think hes lying and then i spiral and think i have to check his phone then i think he deleted messages then i need to check his apple watch and then i think he may have used another form of contact and i start to feel like maybe im being illogical and crossing the line in the moment i feel like nothing can give me relief except for finding solid proof im not proud of this behavior i recently started therapy for my overall anxiety unfortunately it is hard to afford to have sessions often enough context he lied years ago about something relating to a female coworker it was not infidelity after lying he was able to prove he was telling the truth i feel confident about it since then he lied about about small things like not playing video games while on the phone idk i dont want to damage my relationship with this but i also dont want to be lied to again and turn a blind eye so how can i know if i am acting because of anxiety and overthinking opposed to following intuition and following my gut my intuition is how i caught his initial lie,4
first time posting here for context i suffer with anxiety obviously and also have bipolar and ocd parents i find myself constantly obsessing over high blood pressure and high bpm im a heavy set guy im trying to be healthier but i have a long way to go on that sometimes hours of my day are spent stressing over whether my heart rate is too high and when i do so i find it usually makes it go higher i hate going to the doctor because of it because i know my bp will be high and i dont want to know how high today i had to go to the doctor and ofc it was high but i was also having a panic attack while they were checking it because of the nerves i have around the whole thing and already had to walk miles just to get there i wasnt even there over my blood pressure anyway after the visit i was sobbing and hyperventilating the whole way home i just dont know what to do obviously i have to get it under control but in the meantime i need to find some way not to obsess over it because it keeps triggering panic attacks,4
i just wanna rant ab this cuz im embarrassed saying it irl because we all struggle and its not something special i just hate how lifes going and might go im find im just in college i have a fine family situation and everything but man im just tired working doing homework and whatnot the fact that i have to keep working hard in both of these categories to succeed in the future makes me very anxious and i hate it imma keep going tho i just hate it,4

so it was my biology class and it was one of those classes where i had none of freinds in and was extremely uncomfortable every lesson because alot of the time we were made to answer questions infront of the class or have to find partners and obviously me being awkward and with social anxiety i never j never had a partner and because of this i always would get a red face from embarrasment and i guess she took notice because the time we we learning about why the face goes red she decided to ask me a question about it knowing my face would go red and once it did she said oh look its happening now which obviously made it x worse and she littarly made me stand up and face the class it was one of the worst days of my school life in her defence she was older and i doubt she evain knew how painful that was for me to do that but yeah just a random story i doubt anyone read this far lol,4

i m am super frustrated with myself today i had a cardiologist appointment bc i have palpitations sometimes and my heart races randomly when i have acid reflux the cardiologist did some blood pressurepulse checks to rule out pots and said i was fine on that front the ekg came back great and he said my heart was in excellent shape i even asked him to order a take home monitor for me just for some peace of mind and he was ok with that i had an echocardiogram done about year ago with a different cardiologist and everything came back great now as i get home from the doctor my anxious brain gets to plotting and is now worrying that he didnt order you another echocardiogram what if hes missing something my rational brain believes and trusts this doctor very much but the anxiety part of my brain just wants to create more worry for any reason it can find can anyone give me some advice or insight is there even any medical reason i would need a second echocardiogram year later i assume it detects defects that have been there probably from birth so a second one is probably pointless but its hard to tell my anxious brain that i just want to believe the doctors when they give me positive news and believe that im fine edit i should note i am very aware that i have health anxiety and i am currently in therapy for it already it still bugs me though,4
i dont even know why i had so much trouble filling out the forms i know that i have enough documentation and support to at least get an interview and talk to ssa but i couldnt do it they called me and sent me reminder letters and i even had a hard time opening those letters i only have myself to blame for getting denied,4

just in case anyone needs a tw there is talk of medication and in advance im sorry for any spelling errors ampxb wasnt feeling well at all and started stress eating i tried my stratergies that i do with my psychologist but today was just one of those days if you get what i mean ive eaten too much but a majority of what ive eaten is sugar which also gives me headaches when i eat a lot of it also in case this is needed information i dont get sugar high idk if i can take nurofen or panadol panadol is a paracetamol i think and i think nurofe contains ibprofen for the headache because im on ritalin methylphenidate and movox fluvoxamine i think its called something else in america though and most people on reddit seem to be from the us and idk if some pain killers are compatable with ritalin or movox im also on a birth control to manage my periods its called evalyn i think im spelling it right idk the science medication name off the top of my head though but i know i can take pain killers with my bc however it does cause mild indigestion i though itd be good to include this because the intestines and stomach are connected lol the queasy feeling is really bothering me and i feel sickly does anyone have any tips on what i can do to ease it ive drank lots of water both for the stomach ache queasiness and for the headache and have my big water bottle next to me in case i need more but it hasnt helped just looking at anything food related is making me feel like im gonna throw up too ive thought of sleeping it off but i struggle to nap during the day and ive already slept in a ton this morning so my body doesnt feel sleepy at all ive tried putting asmr on too but that isnt making me sleepy would really appreciate if anyone knows how to help this i might try looking more into wether i can safely take some pain killers or not using reliable sources so that i can make sure ill be safe im also gonna ask on a medical related subreddit if i can take ritalin and movox with pain killers at the same time because its really hard to find information online on my own thank you to anyone who reads this and thank you to anyone who can help means a lot to me,4
hi looking for a bit of advice and experiences from ranxiety here around christmas i started to develop some kind of anxiety disorder and had a lot of panic attacks for most of my life ive always been a little anxious and tended to overthink but these symptoms were just much worse up to this point ive also been smoking weed but not excessively mostly once a week after developing said disorder weed now increases my symptoms despite it never doing something like this before and it mostly calming me down even when i had a greenout i mainly suffered physical symptoms in response to my symptoms i started with autogenic training a lot of introspection about my fears and stopped smoking for about a month with this i got the worst of it under control since then ive been smoking a few times with mixed results sometimes i get more anxious and panicky but on other occasions it also felt like a normal high right now i still have some lingering symptoms that can be better or worse depending on the day so ill definitely quit weed until i can resolve this my question now is if any of you here have suffered something similar and were you eventually able to smoke without getting anxious again ill be honest i quit enjoyed being high so that would be quite the bummer but certainly not the end of the world thanks in advance,4

disclaimer the post is slightly copy paste from this thread but i want to share this on many threads in order to get some help im m years old whats really interesting is every single described on this thread are almost identical to the ones i i have right now so if you can please check them out so you understand what i am going troughhttpswwwredditcomrcostochondritiscommentsjrihvchestpainformonthsnoanswersxpromoedpenabled the only logical explanation ive found myself is that it might be severe anxiety or burnout ive experienced which makes my muscles being tense up all the time without me even realising it and get inflamed by the constant stress as well some people from what ive googled claim that it might be side effect after a covid infection around june but oddly enough my wife is totally fine despite both of us having similar symptoms while we were sick i got headaches and my throat hurt her throat hurt and she was tired both of us were x vaccinated the only reason why i rule it out is because these pains did start days after my bed broke down while i was lying on it august and we changed the bed mattress afterwards around october but weve slept on the couch that can be transformed into a bed which is literally a wooden plank with the old mattress on top of it that was way overdue had a hole in the middle so had to change it for almost months before this all happend i was really really stressed for years because of tons of private issue that negatively impacted my mental health and i was inactive during the lock down and after losing my job june ive been almost every day on the pc with bad posture probably from june i got now a new job in september but got laid off from a previous one i was in for months around january also i was on amitriptyline mg for almost a year and stopped taking them as my neurologist told me back than june i used to have around iirc similar painstingles on the left side of my body but not like the ones i have right now i do really hope if anyone finds out what we can do do finally feel better beside accepting our symptoms and live with them i have the typical tingly electric feelings around my left side headaches migraines heart races burningcold feeling on one foot or both etc these symptoms typical come when i feel really anxious now all the symptoms seems to focus on chestpainneck pain with brain fog with especially when the pains are strong the only relief ive found was lying down tough sometimes i had moment where my back was blockedstiffed but just for a short time and after i moved a bit taking walks outside in the fresh air being distracted doing some stretching of the muscle where i have the pain yet what i hate is they all return ive did the classic health anxiety attack routine going to many doctors er etc dozens of bloodtest came fine have a slight arthrosis and disc misplacement on my neck nothing seriously according to the doctors neurologe didnt found any anomaly cardio doctor in augustseptember told me my heart is totally fine we did a stress test on a bike so in the end i really hope its just my anxietyburnout as my doctors all say who gave me all these physical symptoms all i want is that these pains finally stop and if i did write many confusing things please tell me so i can clear it up ps i wanted to add as well that i grew up with stress my whole life ever since my childhood and that even to this day i am really nervous and my fingers are always tremble i am now asking myself if my body decided to crack when i got into my s,4

this is probably a very particular issue and ive never really wanted to post about my anxiety but ive led myself here anyway after a weed induced panic attack about months ago things have been pretty hellish for me ive got a painful feeling in my chest i would say the majority of the day anxiety of course every day now i love love love films i plan to go to college next year and study film ive wanted to become a director for years now as youd imagine that requires me to be able to watch pretty much any kind of film whenever but going to the cinema something i hold so close to my heart as being a place i used to love a place i would go to escape has become really difficult for me i really struggle in the days leading up to going takes serious mental preparation ive been a total of times in which to people who know me is simply unheard of im a big fan of the john wick films and have plans to go see the th one tomorrow ive been waiting a long time to see it but i just cant see myself actually going out and seeing it if youre aware of the john wick films you know that theyre probably the most foot on the gas and brutal action films around which i feel is going to really freak me out in my experiences of going to the cinema with anxiety ive never had to leave the cinema im pretty uncomfortable being there but ive never had to leave i think that the main thing is the fear that this thing i love so much is being taken from me despite me having no evidence to support it while ive been able to push myself to go all the other times i just cant see it happening this time i know its a lot of mental gymnastics but if anyone has anything to tell me at all id really appreciate it thanks,4
starts off slow maybe you dont notice then eventually starts going up and no matter how hard i try to meditate mindfulness and it slowly goes up until it peaks and i crash down then im okay for a day a week and start climbing again it seems to go up and down and im on medication in therapy practice mindfullness and it always seems i take a step or forward then take a step or back its so frustrating,4
i dont know why all of a sudden after almost a week of no symptoms now my body decides to flip the switch and start all over again yesterday i thought im having a heart attack because my left arm was aching all week and then yesterday and even today i had chest pain now it started that my other arm is aching too and my whole body just feels like i have the flu or something even my mouth feels spicy and weird i dont know is this really something anxiety can do i dont feel sick at all but everything hurts like im in full on flu mode pretty much everyone on my mothers side of the family has rheumatism maybe its finaly breaking out for me has anyone else felt like you usually do when you are just completely flu struck only that you arent actually sick today was the first time i took a magnesium supplement mg so maybe it has something to do with that,4
i have heart palpitations that ive been to a cardiologist about for years and have always been told theyre just a result of anxiety i hear of people having heart palpitations during panic attacks or while feeling anxious but i have them all day everyday no matter how calm or regular the moment is i suppose underlying anxiety is still there as im a jittery person naturally but theyre annoying and distracting i tried a beta blocker but it did absolutely nothing my cardiologist says anxiety meds might help but im nervous to take any pills i dont have to i heard magnesium helps with heart palpitations but i know nothing about it how much is good versus bad what form to take it in etc any info is appreciated anyone alleviate heart palpitations with magnesium id love to hear about your experience,4
im not talking about mania or hypomania here but in the past i increased my escitalopram dose a few times i was really climbing the ladder dosewise i think that i had to increase the dose over and over in order to keep the happy effect going so i had to quit and come back down to the proper dose i felt unbelievably great as i increased the dose i took notes on my experience and i was just saying how great i felt and how i had nice memories of my family and my pastmy mood was just great antidepressants have been in use for a while now so im sure theres some wisdom about whether being happy like that is sustainable whether its healthy or not and whether i couldve actually ended that phenomenon of chasing the effect up the dose ladder and gotten the effect to stick most importantly when the happy effect was in place all my adhd medications were working this was absolutely lifechanging i can read in my notes that it says over and over if i could only maintain this level of healthy brainfunctioning and adhdmedication effectiveness then i would have a great life i wonder if theres anything to be learned from this whole experience that i had with the escitalopram and the adhd medications maybe the experience can provide a clue as to what to try in order to have a sustainable foundation for my adhd medications i do have some anxietydepressionocd i dont think that its at the clinical level i mean i looked up the criteria for ocd and one of them said something about the issues taking up an hour of your time each day so im far from that and when it comes to depression and anxiety its a situation where i have mild issues where you could probably say that its unhealthy for me to have the negative tilt to my emotions that i haveagain its nothing clinical though,4
im on week upped to mg days ago and i know about the it gets worse before it gets better thing but it is biting hard very hard im also on lamictal mg x a day,4

sorry for the bad english or any grammar mistake d ive been dealing with my anxiety since i was since then ive been looking for triggers that makes me feel more anxious like a pattern so i could deal better with it i dont have any pro help ive realized that my anxiety gets worse when i have to talk with people so ive been trying to better my communication and im better actually im feeling more calm around other people but there is something that its haunting me since im trying to better my anxiety i realized that there are some people that makes me worse sometimes even colleagues for some reason when i see them or talk with i have a bad feeling a heavy energy and my anxiety explodes because of that i cant trust on them and im always in the alert mode when im around them i dont know if this is a problem that my anxiety creates in my mind or if its something that other people also feels thats why im here im trying to understand if the problem is me and my anxiety or them anyone feels like this around some people ps i cant get away from some of them because of college and my job unfortunatly,4
i still try to do everything even thought im dealing with anxiety this month the feeling of impending doom and the last step for now is to return to my part time job since ive been on holidays so i would like to hear what stuff were you guys scared of doing but still did it and are proud it can literally be anything,4
ive had an overwhelming fear of blindness and deafness for years i developed tinnitus when i was in high school due to exposure to loud music my tinnitus isnt awful im able to be productive around it but ever since then ive been fearful of one day losing all my hearing also ive been fearful about blindness due to a family history of sight issues dry eye syndrome occasional eye floaters and the fact i often work late nights on my laptop i saw a doctor about the eye floaters but was told that those are normal and most people get them im conflicted because i have a smartphone compulsion which feeds my fear of visual impairment i just want to know how i can overcome these fears because they often give me anxiety and i almost cried once out of fear my vision was getting cloudy im sure its not the end all be all but i fear i wont be able to achieve my dreams filmmaking if my sight and hearing are affected would really appreciate any words of encouragement and help thank you,4
my anxiety has gotten really bad lately it has gotten to the point where im getting anxiety attacks almost everyday now and i dont know how to make it stop i cant stop worrying and overthinking my brain wont shut up it has been keeping me up at night and i wake up every morning feeling anxious ive tried meditation exercising yoga and i even cut caffeine out of my diet but nothing has worked i feel so exhausted and defeated i dont think i can cope with this much longer i feel like im on the verge of having a mental breakdown,4
i have been volunteering as dog walking which is helping with my anxiety lately i had anxiety contributed by family and work you can always check ur nearby shelter for dog walking instead of adopting,4
my intrusive thoughts and anxiety have been crazy lately and these concepts have come to mind im petrified ill truly lose it one day and be on record as having the worst attack ever known or something tell me im not alone,4
took mg of zoloft for the first time about hours ago and have been feeling extreme brain fog and derealization yesterday and today and also i feel extremely fatigued and sleepy i only took one pill but i was wondering if anyone knows how long would it take for these side effects to disappear,4
i have a second date anxiety is also telling me its not a date and that im not of interest to anyone other than people that try to take advantage of me with someone next week i am so excited because the first date was a blast my anxiety is telling me to play it cool and not to look too eager and to only express interest if they express interest first i would have listened in the past i think it would be in my best interest to tell them im looking forward to it because i am so i am going to tell them that im excited to see them next week better to be myself and turnoff someone that isnt interested in my genuine excitement to spend time with them than it is to keep pretending,4
ive been trying to answer this question for a while how do i know whats the cause and whats the effect when it comes to mental state am i depressed and suicidal because of how my life turned out to be or am i perceiving life to be more shitty than it is because of underlying mental disorders i have never been to a psychiatrist so i have never been diagnosed but ive been dealing with ocd since i was i experience a lot of mdd anxiety social phobia and adhd symptoms ive also been suicidal for more than years at this point the thing is most of those things appear so small when put next to figures in the bank account most of my issues would immediately disappear only then i would be able to do things because i can not because i have to i experience what id call a money induced paralysis i talk a bit more explicitly about it in thishttpswwwredditcomrgetmotivatedcommentsvqqkdiscussionlackofmotivationinducedbylackof thread its very unlikely that ill ever be financially independent and its unlikely ill ever find something interesting enough id deem worth pursuing for hours on endaka passion those realizations alone are enough to make me apathetic procrastinate on all matters and basically give up on life and wait for the right opportunity to kill myself id rather be dead than live a life i dont consider to be worth the effort ive been thinking about seeing a psychiatrist for the past few months but i have my doubts i procrastinate on making an appointment because it feels like my problems stem from money its not like theyll make me rich over there in fact ill lose money that is enough justification for me not to go i also cant get myself to schedule other appointments blood tests physio dentist because if my life will remain the same despite improving in some areas then why bother ill kill myself anyway without winning a lottery or without some magical epiphany occurring in my mind i suspect there could be something wrong with my brain because plenty of other people have lives objectively worse than me yet they see survival as something of value in and of itself that could be the result of them being ignorant me being ungrateful or my brain being disabled so how do i know whether my shitty mental state is caused by my views on life philosophy bad attitude being lazy ungrateful spoiled etc or by some condition beyond my reach or perhaps thats how its supposed to be because my conclusions are logical and i just cant ignore them,4
recently i just stand doing nothing and then my body gives me anxiety like i used to remember things and get anxious but this time even moving my eyes gives me anxiety feels like fear of having that feeling causes that feeling a sudden sharp pain in chest i dont know how to stop this i get triggered once in a minute and im scared of having heart issues because of this there is also a mild pain in my chest all the time it feels so weird to lose control that much lol,4
i just left my primary doctor and suggested buspar due to all the good things ive heard on here always turn down ssris because of sexual side effects and heard this is better anyway she told me buspar is effectively just like xanax that i cant take both its one or the other theyre both an as needed drug is this true to me xanax is a bandaid long term wont change and work toward a cause she made it sound like buspar is effectively the same even though its an snri not a benzo,4
for example is one more likely to experience side effects the higher the dose or the bigger the increase in dose,4
its not something i wanna do but im made to do it i had a root canal procedure because of an infection and my dentist recommends i get a crown for further stability i personally think its optional at the moment since its my front tooth and it isnt subject to a lot of pressure but you know asian parents theyre forcing me through it tomorrow im so against getting a crown because it involves drilling away healthy tooth structure so that it will fit its permanent because tooth enamel cant grow back and so such a procedure ive been constantly anxious about it since the appointment got booked weeks ago every day since ive been dreaded for the day which is tomorrow has anyone had similar experiences or currently has a crown in their mouth im worried about many things such as whether it feels like your natural tooth whether its the exact same color or a little bit off,4

the moment i step outside i become too aware of the way i walk the way my arms are moving when i walk where my eyes are looking at how im blinking my jaw position my neck position my posture basically the way im looking to another person i try to picture myself how i might be looking and whether its not wierd sometimes i record myself with a phone to see whats the oddity with my behaviour the reason this has developed is because from class i realised there was something wrong people would keep a stare once they got a glance of me i realise in retrospect thats because i looked like a girl even though im a boy perhaps some hormones got messed up and i got some feminine features like long eye lashes girly lips girl type face curved hip short height btw im m unmarried months on antidepressants and anxiety meds i would say definitely helping me find the light one day ill make it,4

hello ive been dealing with bowel mouvements when facing a stressful event which is annoying but i deal with it i rush to the toilets and im good i read that during a fight or flight episode your body wants to removes its wastes be it problem is a few hours later i have to deal with severe cramps in my lower abdomen i do not understand why i get that and its pretty annoying since usually the stressful events happen midday and i get the cramps from pm to am i can barely move even breathing hurts but i manage to fall asleep either way yesterday i had to deal with that again and it was much stronger than usual i felt like someone was stabbing my lower left area every minutes anyways i was wondering if anyone had had that before what exactly happens inside that causes that and if theres anyway to either prevent or help with ot when i have it hot water bottles and massages dont work thanks,4
so back in i worked at a restaurant as a dishwasher as my first job but after the busy season ended i was laid off not only that but was basically laid off with no one even telling me since my boss at the time basically acted like i didnt exist when i tried contacting them about potentially coming back for roughly years since i basically jumped from one seasonal job to another then last year i found myself being rehired in the same position but this time the place is under new management and honestly ive loved it not only is a job i enjoy with a salary that is better than i would have initially expected but it also allowed me to make awesome new friends and get reacquainted with old ones but since the start of the holiday season ive been off duty so to speak until the dining room opens back up in may ive recently found out in the company group chat that it will open up on mothers day weekend to which i responded roughly with awesome so i guess that will be roughly when im coming back that was days ago and since then the group chat had been dead silent id assume it was cause everyone was busy and didnt see but the chat says that pretty much everyone saw it and now its starting to feel similar to when i got laid off when i first worked there and i dont know why i would be since pretty much everyone has said how awesome i am for how hard i work and how good i am at my job so considering that i may not have anything to worry about but the fact that everyone saw that specific message yet didnt say anything in response feels suspicious at the very least what should i do do i have reason to worry or am i just worrying too much about nothing,4
this is something i have noticed on the t and as much as i am grateful for it the imposter in me is asking questions today is my lets be anxious about absolutely everything day so we are on the subway and no one sat beside me like i said super grateful cuz i hate people in my safe space but i also am offended that no one sat beside me like what kinda hypocrisy is this is it the same for everyone ugh idk,4
i f have been given the diagnosis of gad generalized anxiety disorder and it has taken an extraordinary toll on my physical health i am in a constant state of fight or flight and ive never been in this much pain in my life its the kind of pain people kill themselves from i am constantly shaking and throwing up this constant stress has given me the diagnosis of ibs irritable bowel syndrome i had to go to multiple doctors as ibs is hard to diagnose the stomach pain triggers the anxiety and the anxiety triggers the stomach pain so basically im constantly in both mental and physical pain however i believe it goes deeper than gad it doesnt stop its not attacks either it doesnt come or go it stays ive taken benzos and they dont do shit for me and neither does any depression or anxiety medications i wish i could be sedated so i dont have to be awake and in pain there have been a few incidents where i had to go to the hospital and beg to be sedated or at least booty juiced or something that would put me to sleep luckily i found lamictal and it has saved my life i honestly dont think i would be alive today if it hadnt been for modern medicine but this still raises the question of what is actually wrong with me im thinking of this because my lamictal is beginning to lose its effect and i have to increase my dose every couple of weeks i couldnt get a therapy appointment scheduled until late june so im kinda fucked,4
i really dont like driving and honestly i really dont need to drive either at the moment i have had lessons in an manual this recently switched to automatic i not a great driver either i get too close to the pavement and dont like going fast when its focusing on parking im less stressed out as its an empty car park i guess i dont like having to concentrate and although there is less to concentrate on with an automatic i still dont like it when im a passenger unless its like a short trip im asleep or if its short i am looking around or checking my phone went on much faster roads and lots of roundabouts accidental knocked a curb and someone on a roundabout in the left lane decided to give way to a truck waiting on the left while i was also on the roundabout in the right lane been having like hour lessons and although i make sure that i dont have much to drink before hand and go to the bathroom twice before my lesson there is always anxiety and im either running from the car or very unfortunately last week was at the lights and far from being able to leave the car and im still mortified and canceled by next lesson and wanting them to just keep the money for the one other lesson i prepaid for i just really dont want to see the instructor ever again if it were up to me i wouldnt continue driving lessons because i dont like it and i dont need to i am very happy walking or getting the bus but my parents dont understand that i really dont want to drive,4
i need to premise this with saying that i recognise that i drink as it is the only time i dont feel anxious anymore and its a vicious cycle and so please telling me that stopping drinking is an obvious step i am taking now and it certainly doesnt help to say this to me now recently i have been feeling increasingly anxious and paranoid after drinking about things i may have done or said during the night this is obviously even worse if there are moments of the night i dont remember or if i blackout after a recent night out i dont remember going back home from the club with some colleagues who i am semi close with im new to the job there is basically a meter walk home that i dont remember i asked and i was told by them that i was very drunk and was vomiting but other than that it was a great night and we should do it again however i am absolutely convinced that i said or did something bad that night just like im always convinced i did something bad the previous time that i maybe told them i want to rapehurtabuse someone or that i was racist towards someone or that i said a secret and even if they said that it was absolutely fine im convinced that they are hiding something from me that they are waiting for the perfect moment to expose me that they are all laughingtalking behind my back i feel like i ruminate over scenarios i may not remember or know even happen so much that memories almost build themselves in my head and from moment to moment a memory is more and more vivid this is not a new thing in my life i wake up terrified of checking my phone for embarrassing or illegal things i may have done if theres a murder in the news i check the location to ensure there was no chance it could be me the same happens in my sober life i convince myself that someone is angry at me so i will spend literal hours looking over a phone chat between us thoughts or worries plant themselves in my head and i cannot let them go one day i raped someone the next i have cancer one day i pissed someone off the next day the past is coming to get me im terrified of getting out of bed as something will trigger panic if someone can relate to this then i virtually plead for a comment or chat i feel like i am losing control of my thoughts and emotions and this goes for sober life as much as when i drink,4
i recently woke up from a really bad high and i am absolutely riddled with anxiety ive got high quite a few times before and have never had a reaction this bad im fortunate i was in a safe environment with people i trusted now this morning i dont even want to get out of bed and i am full of so much regret for how i spent my night ive actually made amazing progress with my anxiety and havent been at this level for so long i dont want this hiccup to undermine my progress but i truly feel horrible anyone experienced anything similar,4
how do your therapists react when you tell them you consume cannabis ive gotten everything from the nonjudgmental does that help to a full on rant about how drugs can cause more anxietydepression and please let us know if youre on other drugs i wonder if theyre giving the same rant for people who drink multiple times a werk i think my main regret with bringing it up is i feel like therapists dont see me as reliable anymore which is really funny because i consume a very small amount of edibles about twothree times a mo and i dont drink alcohol or use any other substances but i can see it on their face that they dont believe me it seems like a catch does it even help to be honest,4

i know that sounds like a really dumb and childish question i have a crush on a girl my brother is friends with her brother my brother and her are also friends and seem to talk often she had a crush on and liked my brother at some point maybe she still does i have no idea sadly we never really talk or anything especially outside of social gatherings where the whole group is already hanging out i spoke directly to her and vice versa a handful of times yesterday while we were all hanging out it was kind of me just speaking for the sake of speaking i didnt go out of my way to do it too much though because i was very anxious nervous and insecure around her anyway weve never interacted on social media and she hasnt followed me or anything even though she probably knows that i have some social media accounts for example on twitter she has most likely seen me reply to my brothers tweets am i just being childish and overanalyzing social media im afraid she thinks i dislike her and or dislikes me she probably thinks im weird anyway i dont think she would like me or find me attractive in any way i think she can tell im ambitionless and socially awkward and maybe mentally a little odd,4

i have been on antidepressants since the age i have severe anxiety that sometimes leads to anxiety attacks in the past few months i hit a deer equaling worth of damage with a deductible i used all my sick days at work my psychiatrist quit and i wasnt able to get my zoloft or adhd meds filled an electrical panel in my car stopped working i paid almost for a rental car while mine was in the shop and i couldnt even use it the first day because it wouldnt make it up my icy driveway causing me to be late for work it was that day i decided to go to my usual walk in clinic to see if they could call me in zoloft because i was having a hard time getting out of bed see your body cant stay in fight or flight mode indefinitely which is what anxiety is so eventually it has to shut down depression i get there and they tell me i have to have an appointment that was apparently the straw that broke the camels back i began crying and hyperventilating it was one of my worst panic attacks ever part of me was concerned they were going to have me committed they were able to call in a day supply and made me a follow up appointment which was today and they remembered my scene so obviously my erratic behavior is because im a drug addict i never once had to take a drug test to get my adhd meds with my old psych this time they asked me to pee in a cup i have anxiety so of course my first thought was that they thought i was bonkers the other day but i had nothing to hide so i obliged when i got home i got a call saying they couldnt call in my meds because i tested positive for opiates excuse me thats impossible they said i would need to bring in a prescription to explain the reason i failed i said i hadnt taken anything and that i could now care less about my medicine but this needed fixed to clear my name they said they could send it off to the lab and i said yes you better do that yes i am still being emotional and irrational at this point not because of what they are accusing me but because my seratonin and dopamine receptors do not work like they shouldwhich is the reason i was going there for help instead they decide to bring a devastating accusation against a person with emotional dysregulation adhd and anxiety generalized anxiety disorder and social anxiety disorder it is negligence what if this behavior caused a person to harm themselves do no harm the way in which they handled this was very harmful almost as if they have no training on how to handle delicate individual which medical personnel should i did some research and guess whatpoppy seeds i just made a batch of lemon poppy muffins the day before yesterday surely the lab will be able to differentiate between poppy seeds and an actual drug right its a small town and i know they will break patient confidentiality because im a teacheri just know itive had some of their kids in class of course they will tell other parents im done with my adhd medsi refuse to jump through these hoops anymore and to be treated like a criminal im erratic yes but not because of drugs im falling apart right now,4

hi all i never struggled with anxiety like this before when suddenly i had a panic attack for the first time last month i felt suddenly extremely uncomfortable and trappedunsafe in the minutes leading up to it but the whole time i was still thinking rationally but the physical symptoms were definitely there and since then ive been having these mini bouts of extremely rapid hyperventilation just randomly through the day and tightnesspain in the cheststomach these originally happened whenever i thought any remotely negative thought at all but now theyre just popping up at random times currently im sat here with my stomach in knots and feeling like im about to cry for absolutely no reason at all i wouldnt say im very worried about anything in particular just the normal things ive been a little stressed about my whole life like school but its getting really annoying to have these small or on occasion fullblown anxiety attacks nearly every day again this is all completely new to me im prone to overstressing or worrying at times but these symptoms dont seem to be completely related to that since they come on so randomly and i feel like they would have popped up sooner during more stressful times in my life if anyone has any insight it would be much appreciated because its getting really freaking annoying and interfering with my schoolwork and personal relationships at this point would something like therapy even help me if its so primarily physical what do i do thank you,4

i have ha and one of my worst fears came true my bf found out he has a rare genetic disorder that has a chance to be inherited were commited and planning kids in the future i freak out over a fuckin cough and this is driving me crazy for me the worst part is that my boyfriend is an absolute flegmatic and works on dont think about what you cant solve approach i almost broke down when he brought the results home and he was just like well see what to do when it happens its not like theres something we can do about it and then i saw in the report that they offered him an assisted reproduction option when well want kids and asked him if hell want to go down that route and he said dunno and it was obvious that hes not too excited about it but like how can you even think about risking chance of it being inherited by our child it drives me absolutely bonkers why would you even be willing to risk it when there is way safe option that is not that natural but would ensure that well have a thriving healthy baby and especially when the other alternative is pretty miserable both physically and mentally weve been together for years and at this point i know him i know he only seems to not care because he has a hard time explaining and showing his emotions i also know i am being terribly terribly unfair towards him for feeling frustrated at him he just found out something so crucial he needs time and space to deal with it and he needs my support instead i am the one demanding emotional support from him i am demanding it only here dont worry i dont plan to freak out on him while hes going through this i dont understand why i am being so selfish when usually i put others first automatically but most stress inducing thing about it is he mentioned some of my health issues to the genetic center and now they want to see me too because they have a small suspicion that there might be something from my side too of course i googled the signs of what he has and well i am not surprised they want to see me i check all the boxes even skeletal malformation whats keeping me sane is the knowledge that the disorder is incredibly rare and that neither of my siblings show any obvious signs of it that in itself should logically be enough to reassure me that i am fine but my brain refuses to accept it i feel like someone took me stuffed me into a washing machine and turned on a turbo wash and i want to scream aaaaaaaaaa whew thanks you for letting me get it all out i really need to find therapist again and my man is coming with me this time anyone has any experience with micro deletions in their family or has anyone gone through anything similar how did you manage to calm yourself down while waiting for the doctors to set up the appointmentrun the tests i heard it can take half a year to get an appointment and then half a year till they tell you your test results how did you survive for this long with this uncertainty,4
preface yo male at time of accident nye i smoked a blunt for the first time and the equivalent of overdosed legs felt weak had to sit down i smoked it in at the bottom of my road so i sat down on a neighbour so outside wall roughly ft high next thing i knew i woke up on the pavement looking up i later found out from friends that were with me that i had fallen head first onto the concrete sidewalk from about ft high i am i had a concussion anyway next day all was fine no anxiety obvious scars and bloody face but nothing else about two weeks later i decide to play soccer with friends the ball hit the back of head from behind i immediately fell to my knees and from what i remember was dizzy etc then it kind of just went mins later we left and had a short walk to the local restaurant half way there i had immense lain in my stomach and groin area i fell to my knees again on the sidewalk near the restaurant i then managed to walk to the restaurant and immediately went into the toilet i felt sick anxious weird nauseous etc then cur my first panic attack even since then a whole years i had had generalized anxiety disorder diagnosed how does that even happen i dont understand how hitting my head would cause that did i accidentally damage my amygdalahippocampus when falling thanks,4
hello for about a year ive been having these obsessive thoughts about the past all the ways ive messed up and things i did wrong its kinda ridiculous i worry about things that happened od so years ago and i was just a kid back then only about i think about newer things too but especially back then i was cringy and mean to others for no reason i didnt like the band that they did i never bullied them but i would kinda laugh at them and point out that theyre being pandered to now i would just turn away and ignore them i dont know what was up with me back then to my defense i was almost always the youngest of the group surrounded by people who were from both sides i feel like im a terrible human being and that i will be punished for them any day now i dont know how exactly by some external force that will come from outside of my home im afraid that people who know me now and are my friends or people ill meet in the future will judge me so hard and turn away from me ive deleted every old social media account i could remember i still make sure that my old emails are active so that i could delete any more if ill remember im on pretty heavy medications antidepressants three doses of synthetic pregabalin and an antipsychotic to quell my anxiety further and i can function well but these thoughts still come to me randomly and make me anxious i dont know what to do anymore my biggest wish is to just move on from that period of my life and close this chapter on one hand if someone came to me with thoughts like these i would tell them that it was so long ago and they have likely very little to do with the person they were at besides everyone was a bit of a little shit at that age but for some reason when it comes to me i just cant free myself when i get scared i feel like an ensnared wikd animal only the snare is just in my head did any of you struggle with something like this what should i do,4

so i just spent a bunch of money on video games the online store for the nintendo ds and wiiu is closing soon and i wanted to get a bunch of games before theyre gone forever i could afford this purchase and i still have plenty of money in my bank account but i cant shake this feeling of guilt in the pit of my stomach its like theres this voice in the back of my head calling me an idiot for spending so much money on video games when i could be saving it for emergencies its not just with big purchases either i still get this feeling whenever i buy a lunch too i think this whole thing started when i was around i was at the store with my parents and i wanted to buy a toy but my mom said something about how we didnt have the money for toys i being the stupid kid that i was interpreted this as we dont have a lot of money and that the family was one bad financial decision away from poverty of course this was not the case but that didnt stop me from feeling guilty about making my parents spend money on meand that guilt has followed me even now when im making my own money so am i crazy for feeling this way what are some steps i can take to get rid of this guilt,4
ive been a health freak for as long as i can remember but in the last year or so its dictated my eating habits so severely if i eat anything that ive decided is unhealthy i get such bad anxiety i feel as if i am poisoning myself and figuring out what i can buy at grocery stores is so draining every store trip is like running through an obstacle course its getting really bad again and i spiraled today after falling into a rabbit hole on how most of our food has heavy metals in it most notably spices herbs chocolate and root vegetables after a massive crying fit i threw out my cocoa powder and am currently wondering what to do with all of the grains vegetables spices and herbs i have because i dont see any of it as edible anymore i dont know what i can eat now im so sick of food being like poison to me i envy the people that can just eat and barely think about what it might be doing to their bodies,4

i cant even do simple tasks in peace even if im adjusting to sleep and using my phone in bed my heart feels like its about to explode if i dont take a deep breath in every few seconds because i hold my breath in subconsciously or thats what my body just does to me at least and then my heart rate gets up and i feel so uneasy and breathless from literally just lying down using my phone i hate this shit i cant even yawn properly or take a deep breath in it always gets cut off and im left feeling like im about to suffocate,4
before anyone reads im in the middle of an anxiety attack so everything in this post is everywhere and some words may be misspelled i think i know why too because the last time it happened i ate food that caused me to have a previous anxiety attack after i finish this im going to get some sleep so i will read any comments and make the necessary corrections to this post in the morning so anyway i went across the street from work today to get some food from this chicken spot called kennedy chicken i live in nyc theyre on every corner all of their food is super duper unhealthy its all deep fried foods chicken and mozzarella sticks is what i ate they even gave me spoiled marinara sauce which i didnt eat because i noticed as soon as i opened the sauce container the air pressure made the sauce fly everywhere on my hands and there were bubbles in it i smelled it and it had an obvious spoiled smell to it like fermented tomatoes im never eating from there again ever and honestly i dont know how theyre even still open it has been a while since i ate their food until today ive been trying to eat healthier foods even if i have to order out on days i dont pack my lunch at home i choose a healthier option or or it could be that i havent been getting enough sleep since monday and everytime i feel the palpitations coming on i always go to sleep and the next morning i feel better ive been to the er multiple times for palpitations and they tell me its due to stress and not enough sleep i work a full time job and i used up all my pto so its difficult for me to take a day or two off for myself figuratively rips hair out i hate working full time and i think im about to make a big sacrifice and go part time or maybe i just need to ride it out i have so many financial issues right now that i cant do this anymore i want to move back home with my family but i dont have a car i dont have money i need to buy at least a months worth of food for person me so i dont have to order out i dont have any idea how ive come this far and havent ended up homeless at this point im rambling and i need a hug but these are things im dealing with at the moment that food honestly tasted horrible though im betting on my palpitations being caused by both lack of sleep and the fast food though i wish there was a way to get my rent lowered so that i can afford to pay all my bills properly i might talk to my roommate about it and see what she says okay if i have anything else left to talk about ill make another post thank you to anyone who decides to read this craziness,4

hi ive recently started medication to help manage my anxiety while adjusting to the medication i noticed it helped my society anxiety a lot because i stopped caring however the downside is that i started to become very apathetic about everything and lost a lot of motivation to even get out bedgo to class ive recently started a new medication and so far feelings of apathylack of productivity have improved and i can now finish tasks still not perfect but i feel like with such a low starting dose it feels back to like how ive felt premedication the problem is my social anxiety has gone back up im ashamed and embarrassed to have missed so much class i tried really hard this week and forced myself to go to classes ive been avoiding but there is one class that im especially having a hard time getting myself to attend the problem is the class is very discussion based and we have predetermined groups we work with the entire semester im worried my groupmates will judge me because i havent been to class in so long i just want to avoid the awkward confrontation where have you been even though i know its inevitable how do i force myself to go to class,4

recently i have been doubting everything my job my friendships and heavily doubt my relationship before my anxiety was all consuming my relationship was great but over the last few months its felt like it has deteriorated i cant tell if this is just my anxious brain because i literally doubt everything at the moment or whether this is a sign i should leave does anyone have any experience with this,4
i have constant anxiety every second of every day and its been a few years since ive even come close to crying but my feelings of sadness are nothing compared to my anxious response to wanting to cry i always get to the verge of letting it all out but then it feels like my stomach implodes with anxiety and i have thoughts about memories ive repressed which just increases my anxiety even more until im stuck in the fetal position sometimes i let it pass naturally sometimes i scream or punch my stomach i just i dont know i feel like i wanna cry forever to let everything out not sure if anyone will see this but i really appreciate any response,4
ive begun to realize that throughout the day my anxiety gets worse i wake up feeling okay but as i go through my day something happens where i begin feeling more overwhelmed has anyone else noticed this,4

i feel like im slipping away i navigate bad traffic on the way into work where im in a hybrid tech supportbusiness analyst role so primarily im listening to and troubleshooting everyones troubles through the day the calls sometimes start at am and dont end until after other days and heavy traffic back home every week this year it seems something around the house is breaking and either needing me to repair it or pay someone to come out after sorting out the todo list time is passed with my dogs who i love very much but are extremely pushy and needy some days that goes on until my fatherinlaw gets home and demands that the dogs get put away and everything turned off and focus turned to him so he can tell all about whatevers on his mind he lives with us and if i dont drop everything i have to hear from his family and somehow my family about how i need to stop hurting his feelings then bed and wake up to start over again i get about an hour a week to just myself and hour a week to be me i feel like im losing who i am,4
this girl was cool when i first met her but then she started being really annoying and i didnt feel like being her friend anymore i would tell her something she didnt agree with and then at am shed send these blocks of texts saying she hated herself and that i was selfish and didnt really care for her etc sometimes i just stop texting my friends for personal reasons and go a few days without replying this was never a problem for my longterm friends but apparently it was for her i had to step on eggshells to talk to her and i didnt like it if anyone wants more context let me know but in short i just didnt want this person in my life anymore i always knew she needed help so thats why instead of telling her to fuck off like some people suggested i did i would just let her know when i didnt like something she saiddid but not be mean about it she would apologize for overreacting id forgive her but then she would act the same way today i told her i was tired of her bs and that she could block me if she wants to just stop texting me i blocked her it felt awesome at the moment but now i feel like an asshole i dont regret it but i never said anything similar to anyone my heart was beating fast the whole time should i feel bad for telling the truth this girl has a history of selfharm and overdosing so im afraid ill be responsible if she ends up doing something to herself but i couldnt take this anymore,4
i scheduled an emergency tooth extraction appointment last saturday with my dentist who i havent been able to go to in over a year due to lack of insuranceunemployment my partner went with me as support and also because i cant drive the dentist receptionist lectured me for not coming in for over a year for scheduling an emergency extraction on a saturday afternoon and then said they wouldnt be able to extract it that day because they needed to see if the tooth could be saved despite me saying i cant afford any other option like a root canal they also despite me putting my preferred name in their site portal when i first started seeing them keep misgendering and deadnaming me even though i told them last time that i prefer my preferred name and go by hehim i am a grown ass medically but not surgically transitioned trans man my partner who also goes to this dentist but has had only good experiences with them was apparently disgusted with how the receptionists treated me this time and now refuses to go back to them for their visits but i paid ahead of time for this tooth extraction tomorrow because the receptionists basically forced me into it by showing me all the other pricing options without insurance so i have to go back to them before i can move to a new dentist office my partner is working tomorrow and cant go with me so im basically dreading having to hear my deadname and being misgendered and lectured and all that bullshit all over again but on my own this time like its stressing me out to the point of almost crying i dont usually get this worked up over being misgendered because like im kinda fat and my facial hair is scraggly so i get a lot of misgendering from customers whenever im working retail jobs but something about them knowing my preferred name and having been told about it before but choosing to ignore it is just fucking with me especially with all the other ways they treated me fuck,4

i dont really dont know how to describe this but i just genuinely have that feeling like on the verge of exploding like im so exhausted and dissatisfied with my life and right now i just feel so uncomfortable in my own skin like i just dont even want to be in my body anymore just the feelings that arise from not having a support system experiencing chronic pain trauma and not getting what i want in life academically socially etc is just all coming to a head life just feels so unfair sometimes like im having to work twice as hard as other people in my life and im just drowning but when i complain or ask for help people brush me off or call me over dramatic meanwhile everyone is always expecting me to play superhero for them in their own lives its just making feel so wound up and tense and i dont really know how else to describe it but i cant even focus on work right now,4

tw discussion of anxiety symptoms some context ive struggled with anxiety for a few years but can remember symptoms cropping up at moments throughout my life i think its gad as im mostly anxious about being anxious at this point does anyone else find it hard to ask for help when im stressed by general life things job pressures etc it does cause me to be anxious but i hate telling people how i feel because i dont want to burden them or upset them i also dont even think of asking for help until im in a bad place and really need it does anyone have any tips on how to overcome this,4
i was diagnosed with gad three years ago but have declined treatment in the form of long term medicine probably due to my medical anxiety go figure i would describe my attacks as completely random and not stemming from outside situations typically for instance i will be laying in bed watching a funny show and suddenly feel like an elephant is on my chest two weeks ago i found a man hiding under my car in my driveway i chased him off and called the police turns out he crashed his car up the road and was hiding from the police i was worked up that day and the next but have been able to feel comfort knowing this wasnt some weird targeted attack on me but a desperate man in desperate times or however the saying goes lol however my physical symptoms have not left my chest constantly feels heavy and i cannot get a good breath i almost have to force myself to yawn to feel like im getting that deep breath its affecting my life mostly limiting my physical movements and causing headaches assuming from constantly forcing a deep breath i dont have a pcp i can call for advice but i feel like enough is enough and i would like to be able to breathe normally again my mom has copd so i have a pulse ox around and my oxygen has been consistent at so i can mostly confidently say this is anxiety my issue is do i call a doctors office and wait weeks to be seen or go to an urgent care pay for them to tell me this is just anxiety ultimately what are my options here i just want to feel normal again,4

hi all i hope i could get some opinions from the kind followers of this subreddit for as long as i m could remember i had pretty intense anxiety as a result i overthink and selfsabotage a lot about months ago i got into a relationship with a phenomenal woman f shes so driven smart witty and funny and at first i was sure that she was absolutely gorgeous however these past few days ive been wondering if i truly am attracted to her i know this is weird but when i look at pictures of her i find myself analyzing her facial features without even realizing it i am constantly quizzing myself on whether i like her or not this isnt the first time it has happened i remember the first time i went on vacation with my one and only ex i suddenly started to hyper fixate on each of her features and started to see her differently if that makes any sense instead of seeing a coherent face i saw a collection of facial features her nose seemingly looked larger and the proportions were all off again i know this sounds so weird i pushed those thoughts aside and eventually got over it she broke up with me for a completely unrelated reason im wondering if anyone has been through this as well part of me thinks im shallow for worrying about this but part of me wonders if its the anxiety thats causing this thank you,4

ive been struggling with headaches amp a lot of brain fog for the past month or so it hasnt really caused any issues besides me feeling super out of it amp pain until recently after a really sharp pain in the left side of my head which has lead to the buzzing in my head getting a lot worse and the same side throbbing randomly im so anxious it could be something serious but my brain is also telling me im overreacting its causing my health anxiety to flare up a lot its gotten so bad im wide awake googling symptoms of what it could possibly be amp struggling to even relax at home because the symptoms are constant which leads my anxiety going through the roof and the cycle continues i wanna go to the doctor but i also dont wanna waste their time in case they cant help me or it isnt anything at all amp its all in my head i was struggling before this but now this is really debilitating for me i dont wanna get out of bed because im just gonna have to deal with the random painthrobbing and the anxiety about it i just wanna feel normal again,4
so i went to my gp general practitioner aka your family doctor and told her i had been feeling anxious lately especially before big exams or oral presentations i start shaking and feeling physically sick unfocused cant think straight etc she gave me a prescription for inderal and told me to take it on days when i have exams or big events however i googled and it just looks like something to lower your blood pressure so not that im complaining because honestly anything helps but isnt this just going to treat the physical symptoms instead of the overlying issue aka the anxiety it just sounds like ill still have the mental anxiety just with a lower heartbeat lmao has anyone tried this medication and has it worked for you im not doubting my doctor but id like to know how it felt for other people,4

hello today i m fully realized that i cannot function properly as a human being unless im directly seeking acceptance in others this translates to me not showering not brushing my teeth not shaving not even washing my hands when no one is going to see that i am clean and normal i recently started college ive been making friends and generally having a great time this if u look at it from the outside inside my head i just cannot get the sense out of my mind that someone is going to think less of me and criticize me physically because of my clothes my face my hair because i have a gray shadow even after just minutes of shaving because somehow i smell bad etc i have crippling anxiety just thinking about someone criticizing my looks in their heads and dont let me start with my personality basically all this converts into me having a sort of double life when i need to go outside i do all the work i can possibly do to try and look nice smell good and be a nice person but the moment im in my home my mind unconsciously switches to a gross side i dont take care of myself in any way type or form suddenly i am mean lazy antisocial and want to die once again the cycle repeats day after day ive been trying to make myself go to the gym and eat better for months now but my body just doesnt respond every fiber of my mind tells me that i cant do anything right i will always be kinda ugly kinda fat and kinda gross so why bother trying maybe nothing of this makes any sense sorry english is not my first language and im just trying to cope somehow,4

f and i need help apologies for typos on mobile and length but so so grateful for those who read this my shoulders chest back and jaw are always cleanched like im subconsciously trying to curl up into myself i cant sleep small sounds cause my heart to race and i wake up with adrenaline im always exhausted and because of this im feeling so hopeless i cry out of fear or frustration at least once a day now making me feel pathetic and empty i shake have numb limbs depersonalization and chronically check my pulse i feel like im dying all the time and like someone vacuumed all the joy and confidence i once built up out of my soul i stopped taking sertraline after ish years and its going terribly i slowly weaned myself off because of an imminent lack of insurance back in september and im not doing well before i went off medication i went part time from working a full time management position for over years at first i was elated to be home so much i had dreamed of being part time accomplishing so many things at home we bought a foreclosed home years ago with tons of issues just being less stressed in general but because of the part time status i lost insurance my partner who works hour days and i were not married yet and knowing i would lose coverage and wanting to get pregnant soon i slowly weaned myself off sertraline as responsibly as possible this actually went okay surprisingly but im thinking it was because i still had medication in my system before i was off meds i was binge drinking about times per week which has been an issue since i was as well as insane amounts of weed smoking so additional self medication that was frankly really bad to do on meds drinking was ingrained in me as a coping mechanism that caused so so many problems over the years being medicated helped numb the terrible anxiety and withdrawing i would go through with drinking so it made it possible to continue this cycle for years i am a very naturally anxious person from childhood until now i am an only child who had an extremely verbally abusive father which i know caused a lot of problems by december of this year i had noticed the familiar feelings of not just hintsofanxiousness but the crippling anxiety coming back i drink a bit in decemeber and for at least five days after would notice terrible horrible anxiety withdrawals and sleeplessness this was so much more severe unmedicated i literally had to stop which had not happened consistently since my teens because of it being a coping mechanism and major ingrained habit i had some huge issues mourning a friend and psuedotool i had used for years to overcome social anxiety and insecurity this was obviously never helping but in the throes of addiction and habit i couldnt recognize it then caffeine started affecting me in a negative way even small amounts would cause heart palpitations and severe unease it became a gateway for a panic attack i would usually consume a decent amount of caffeine before work which made me feel more efficient confident and social just like drinking now i had lost two major things i used to cope with life i had some peace with knowing i should have quit drinking years ago and letting it go but now i couldnt even handle caffeine but wait theres more enter weed smoking which i had already largely cut back i went from smoking as soon as i got home from work to just before bed to sleep i have always had major sleeping issues and maijuana helped turn my obsessive thoughts off so i could sleep now it was causing the same panic caffeine did i had a violent panic attack in january after smoking and almost thought i needed to call an ambulance im sure by now you can see i have some substance reliance issues i know this and im not proud i should in theory be proud i stopped three bad habitsaddictions and antidepressants instead i feel lost i feel empty i feel devastatingly hopeless i feel truly alien like i cant be a normal functioning human im chronically jittery exhausted and scared i feel like although overcoming addiction i have backslid into my lowest low i have had to leave work because of panic attacks i dont go out to social events unless absolutely necessary and spend the whole time in partial terror i have no joy in anything i used to care about i feel like im driving my mother and husband insane with my repetitive obsessive anxieties insecurities and attacks they are so supportive but i cant help but feel like they are a little over it the last two months have been awful by now i expected some relief from my brain getting used to being off meds but instead im now worried this is just who i am unmedicated i obsess about the house not being fixed people judging it things imminently breaking about not being pregnant yet biological clock shit disapointing family and friends and its leaving me feeling utterly hopeless i have been in therepy off and on for years read countless books every supplement out there meditation watched tons of videos and documentaries on anxiety improved my diet reached out to others breathing exercises you name it i know most of the tools to help with anxiety ive tried almost all of them i have held off on going back on medication in hopes of becoming pregnant but that hasnt happened yet and frankly i dont want to start and stop medication again right now im afraid of everything i feel like im disconnected and disassociated from myself its unrelenting i dont have good days lately shit id take mediocre ones i have tried to push through get tasks done around the house to feel like im accomplishing something positive affirmationsnothing is working im so tired im so sick of being afraid of basic life tasks like making appointments working social obligations etc im tired of feeling adrenaline over every sound waking up anxious taking hours to fall asleep because im anxious and dont sleep im so sore because im always clenched and tense im always checking my pulse im always worried about horrible things happening to myself and family health related or otherwise this cyclical unrelenting chronic crippling anxiety is making me insane i am considering therepy again but past experiences have not been the best i guess im just trying to find someone who gets it this isnt something i feel like the average person who ive talked to about anxiety understands who else has panic attacks in the freezer aisle of the grocery store work or at baby showers my senses feel so heightened to any stimuli i cant keep putting on a brave face and hearing peoples surprise when i tell them how anxious i am all the time but youre so calm you seem so chill ugh i must mask it well because im internally combusting this doesnt feel like it will ever relent and im starting to just feel anxious and depressed chronically i cant live like this anymore and im losing all hope of improving thank you so much for reading,4

ive been thinking a lot about ai recently the explosion of chatgpt midjourney dallesomeone with zero writing or art skills can spend seconds coming up with a prompt and generate something incredible something a human would spend hours or even days coming up with and its accelerating faster than we could have imagined ai voice spoofing ai generated images of celebrities and politicians plagiarized college essaysthese things were unimaginable months ago all this gives me anxiety and not just because im a writer as my profession its devaluing human talent and creativity everyone can now do it therefore it means nothing oversaturation renders everything meaningless and the irony is that humans made this tech that is now outshining all of usand will ultimately do everything better than we can this is a pivotal time in humanity and i am not ready for it and i dont think anyone is really ready for it everything from the way we work to the way we consume media will be completely upended by ai i just want to rewind years and live peacefully i dont want all this change and its filling me with anxiety hopelessness and dread,4

hello i have always been anxious and as of years ago i was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder ive been in therapy for years and tried all sorts of medications lexapro zoloft medical marijuana cbd valium klonopin xanax amitriptyline and the only thing that worked were the benzos im extremely lucky to have an np who fills my xanax refills the problem is i dont want to be addicted to this medication i take it very sparingly which is why it works so well but i only take these when i feel nauseousjitterypanicky which fortunately is not however i do have gad pretty bad in the shower thoughts just race and i cant find the off switch its ruined my sleep its taken a dump on my memory i just cannot live like this anymore meditations help in the moment i do them but i feel like i need to be medicated i was on zoloft for about months and it helped tremendously but when i tried getting back on it i properly titrated my dose when i get off them for some reason the side effects were extremely unbearable granted i started back at mg when before i was on it for mg for a week and then mg the second week and continued for weeks it could also be that at the time i could tolerate medical marijuana but now that makes me either anxiousjittery or straightup nauseous lexapro forget it i started at mg and that was a nightmare i was so nauseous by day if it wasnt for my antinausea med i wouldve projectile vomitted all over my kitchen floor the other time i was at mg and i felt so cracked out i also dont like that ssris are rough on my body for weeks maybe thats just the gamble you take but i hate having increased anxiety inability to ejaculate and horrendous stomach pains for a month does that sound like fun to anyone i took amitriptyline and that was more for chronic pain and it barely did anything and as for anxiety i didnt notice much of a difference either and i tried this medication at and mg i have an appointment with my np tomorrow and she is well aware i struggle with anxiety is there a medication thats not an antidepressant that works for gad and is not a benzo meaning i can take as often as needed ive also tried supplements like ltheanine melatonin and ashwagandha and they dont do crap any experiences with nonantidepressants that worked for you,4
whenever i have any event i get insane rising anxiety leading to it anything like public presentation job interview doctor appt or even going to a friends house party or going out haha i rarely days before ill start preparing night before i can barely sleep i can feel adrenaline increasing hours i get extremely alert the day of i wake up i cant eat anything cant even drink more than a few sips of water the hours leading up i begin hard coughing and dry heaving to the point ill damage my throat and it gets sore i never actually throw up but this has been happening so long i just dont eat to be safe still i get uncontrollable gagging like i actually think i gave myself a hernia im talking violent gagging until i see stars floaters and lights in my eyes heart racing chest muscles stomach strained and hurting from the none stop gagging and heaving and coughing then right when i walk into the event its all gone im still nervous but my mind tends to blank out and i disassociate a lot this really fucks up technical job interviews because i totally blank out a pure calm bliss blank state after i go home a complete weight is lifted off me im starving now extremely low anxiety relaxed rest state eating a ton because i probably have been eating cals the last few days i really wasnt built for this life i need to go live in some mountains or something anyone else have anything similar to share thanks for reading lol,4
i was having a panic attack then i calmed down a little and then suddenly i feel like something is taking away my breath from the inside for a second its like a sleep apnea but i am awake is this normal ive had this in sleep before when fell asleep after being stressed but ive never had this awake now i have a strange feeling in my throat and stomach might this be related to stomach,4
difficult combination of things that make me very overwhelmed been hyper stimulated the past month where i just feel pretty terrible but its starting to get better as of the past couple days im debating on taking partial amounts of clonozopam idk how to spell it its a benzo and typically i wouldnt do it but having to start work and feeling overwhelmed i dont see another option any suggestions on how i should go about i just wanted it to be a temporary thing to get me going or use in moments of very high discomfort while working,4
this past few months ive had a set of symptoms that have had me worried that i have a neurological disorder i am wondering if these symptoms could be caused by stress and if anyone here has had similar symptoms they know to be caused by stress a little context i recently got accepted into my dream job the only hitch is that it has intense training for six months where if you fail a test at any point you are dismissed the material we are required to study is immense in volume and the tests are close to twice a week in the month leading up to the course i found myself experiencing a small head fog it developed more and more over the weeks into the worst head fog of my life i could barely think and always felt a sort of pressure in my head math i would normally fly through was difficult and even just simple thoughts were hard to get out sometimes as the course started my vision started to feel off not quite sure if it wasis double or blurry as its not that bad but i can tell its off my eyes also got super sore for a week or so about a week ago i also started to feel my left jaw and arm go a bit numbtingly its mostly there but comes and goes in intensity since the head fog i have been chronically online in search of answers which has lead me down every rabbit hole i am frightened i have something like ms and though i know my research into it along with my stress with my course is more likely to blame i cant help but doubt that stress alone could give me blurry vision numb armface and immense brain fog i would really appreciate anyones experience with stress ms or related symptoms thanks all,4
hi everyone i have been experiencing on and off burning sensation only in my right side of the face i think that if it would be anxiety its usually on both sides has anyone experienced something similar,4
like when im anxious there isnt much i can do about it i can try to self soothe and whatnot but its still hard to put on a smiley face and be upbeat and cheerful especially when you can feel this way for days at a time or longer but people look at you differently if youre not upbeat and bubbly and cheerful especially as a woman if i dont enjoy everything or laugh at everything or keep conversation im grumpy or in a bad mood or just weird and what am i supposed to say that im anxious so they can respond why and thats just a rabbit hole i cant go into,4
because of my bad academic performance i was advised to go to see a doctor and i did after h of taking he said i have a slight depression and gad and gave me a description to take brintellix i didnt feel i had gad so i went to see another one this time i didnt talk much it was quick m and still the second doctor said the same slight depression and gad this time the description is g of venlafaxine should i take the med or see a third one,4

im not sure what to call them but theyre like nightmares but its not spooky scary or someone dying nightmare its just you in an uncomfortable situation and you have a complete anxiety attack and everyone judges you for it and insults you for being weak and all your insecurities are multiplied i get these kinda often and im genuinely curious if its normal or an anxiety thing or if its abnormal,4

hello all just wanted to drop in to see for those who use marijuana as a means of battling anxiety such as myself which strains have provided you the most relief i am a medical patient in the state of pa so this is fully legal thanks in advance,4
i am only able to focus when i take mg valium i am then able to drive and work again i only take it once or twice a week but i am thinking about upping it a little cause its the only time i can be productive and get out of my mess,4
has anyone ever dealt with panicanxiety attacks when they are driving started with me about years ago when i swirved off the road and ever since then i get panic attacks i am able to drive on regular roads but the highways i have the most difficult time with its unbearable to deal with especially when you have to drive often any one find a way to overcome and deal with it willing to try anything to erase this feeling and going back to driving normal i used to love to drive all the time,4
im feeling something hard to describe and a bit numb i assume it has to do with anxiety because of my breathing patterns and overthinking its triggered very easily by the confrontational tone my mom takes sometimes its lately about a sensitive topic she assumes my feelings and it feels like shes arguing with me about things where theres no need to argue because im literally just telling her how im feeling bad about the things i did wrong in my relationship and such and shes arguing about why i keep feeling this way about it and keep blaming myself for a lot of it she says things about my ex that i dont know how to feel about things like her life is negative and all over the place anyway and she dragged you into it and all that i feel like when she argues with me about my feelings its a form of gaslighting i had been doing progress recovering from hating myself and seeing things more objectively concerning the relationship i always feel like im pretending whenever im not doing well or when i intentionally try to get better i never perceived i had real struggles in life in therapy i saw that i did have things to deal with invisibly with my family i had set for the last few days on the road for feeling more authentic with myself and people around me i felt the breakup was an obvious hurdle that i can make use of for growth without feeling pretentious about overcoming things because of how it forced me to rethink things about myself while validating why theyre there to begin with moms argument for the relationship is just that my ex was a very negative person whos carelessly trying to gatekeep me i spiralled so hard after a tough breakup conversation where i saw it wasnt true i hated how i couldve been convinced of that too i hate the person it made me i hate how in my head i was throughoit the whole relationship and mom contributed to that im too impressionable with mom somehow these things are linked now that i write without inhibitions i guess ill just keep writing until this feeling of emptiness passes but i was starting to like myself more as of yesterday she doesnt know how much this approach of hers affects me i was starting to feel like a more genuine and stoic person now im back to thinking in ways about my ex that im not proud of i,4
i dont feel like i have a personality i feel boring i know im probably not and im overthinking it but everything about me feels fake for some reason i think i grew up my entire life fighting so hard for validation and only doing things for other people that now my personality traits feel like bits and pieces of other people and not my own ive also noticed that even though im i am hardcore reverting into being a child i love cartoons i love squishmallows i want pink and blue all over my living space i want to be a little kid but theres also a constant fight against that with my adult side maybe im trying to heal my inner child probably but i just want so badly to feel like a genuine person and know who i am me its just been bothering me a lot lately,4
hi i have a feeling that every breath that i take is gonna be my last or that im goin to collapse and its crippling me i cannot walk more than a couple of meters now and have no quality of life i feel so desperate now and hopeless has anyone else experienced this or have any advice on treatment ive done brain scan heart scans etc and they are coming back clear any help at this stage would really appreciated as i dont how much more of this i can take and i have a young family,4
i just came back from a semester abroad during which i basically completely dropped using sertraline which id been using for years simply because i had no daily routine and forgot basically every day now im back and my anxiety is worse than its ever been and i stopped seeing my old psychiatrist before i left since she was horrible so im still searching for a new one i still have the meds and theyre not expired but surprise surprise im too anxious about what could go wrong to take them without medical input i feel horrible and my mom basically blew up at me the other day saying how we went through so much effort to make sure i had enough medication to last me during my time abroad and now im suffering for basically no reason and shes absolutely right and im so mad at myself,4
im on mg propranolol a day plus effexor for anxiety panic attacks and depression it seems to work pretty well except some days i am tired my gp did comprehensive blood tests a few months ago and everything was normal im also on acetazolamide for idiopathic intracranial hypertension i cant stop worrying about my health and lately my anxiety has been centred around fatigue i can sleep up to hours a day sometimes and take naps at least twice a week im really worried that i have cancer or a heart problem im young so i know its unlikely but i cannot stop worrying,4
i havent slept in two nights and ive been drinking too i was hoping the alcohol would knock me out but it hasnt my girlfriend is asleep beside me and i really dont wanna wake her but im concerned because ive been convulsing and my heart kinda of aches too i also havent eaten so im completely drained of energy but im trying to stay hydratedi just dont know what to do anymore,4
ive had anxiety and panic attacks since i was a little kid always thought i was having a heart attack i was always told it would get better after a decade of therapy and years of medications its gotten so bad i cant do anything anymore i can hardly leave the house i dont have any friends to call my symptoms have evolved to much worse and much scarier things im coming down from a panic attack right now and my face arms chest and feet felt like they were burning up that hasnt happened before and ive been having some other scary new symptoms the past week but of course i dont know if its anxiety or a legitimate problem and i cant afford to see a doctor even if i wanted to do so a few months ago i had one where my face started going numb i sobbed in the car with my hand hovering over on my phone waiting for the stroke i live with my parents still but they are going out of town for weeks and i will be completely alone my panic attacks get horrendous at night recently they have given me some really dark thoughts sometimes i wish i was dead so at least i wouldnt have to deal with this ever again ironic because im terrified of dying i think what if knowing my parents are here at least gives me some sense of safety not much but some but now im going to be completely alone im so scared and so embarrassed cause im a grown adult who is sobbing because shes scared of mom and dad going away i genuinely do not have a single person to help me,4
im pretty sure this is okay but i wanted to reach out and make sure im prescribed xanax and my dr told me to take it hours after drinking if ive drank i had some red wine about oz its been under three hours but im very anxious and cant handle it haha so i took mg half of my usual dose will i be ok,4
to preface i am not clinically diagnosed with anxiety however id like to think that theres something going on in my brain thats resemblant of anxiety im not sure where else to post this so my apologies if this is an inappropriate subreddit to do so ive come to realize that i have a deep fear of hitting people i dont believe this was induced by anything during my childhood i led quite a happy normal one however ive recently realized that i would never hit someone even if it came down to selfdefense and its quite deterring i simply cant bring myself to cause direct physical damage to someone it feels like my muscles just disintegrate on me and my brain is doing everything possible to convince myself not to hit them i dont know if im overthinking this or if this is something of genuine concern,4
ill be honest i dont exactly know the point of this post other than im really really tired of living and feeling the way i am from ages my life was terrible my family was broken apart and pitted against each other there was verbal and mental abuse every day seeking help wasnt an option and it was all made to seem like normal life years later im still dealing with it i know my anxiety and depression originated from my childhood and i know i have realistically nothing to worry about but no matter what i tell myself what i prove to myself how hard i work or how happy i try to be its never enough for me i have a good job that i am interested in but it has turned into a nightmare even though im good at it literally as soon as i get off on my way home i will start having anxiety about potential fuck ups i can make and the work i have to do tomorrow ill stress about work at least more times before i clock back in the next day i mean even when i sit in my car for lunch i start getting anxious i see my friends maybe once a month due to a lack of motivation or interest in seeing anybody it takes a long youtube video and about minutes just to tell my brain to stfu and sleep i dwell on my fuck ups and im scared shitless of letting people down i say yes to basically anything anyone asks me to do i actually think im scared of what people will say or do if i say no the anxious feeling of what if stops me from meeting new people going to fun places with my friends and enjoying life nothing gives me pleasure anymore and i rarely get excited about things i feel very emotionally numb to everything except stress fear worry and anger my anxiety and depression was a main factor in my first and last failed relationship due to me being so numb to myself and my so i feel like i care about nothing i dont find pleasure or happiness in being around my friends doing the things i love or anything fun my biggest problem and the main reason im making this post is that i dont talk to anyone about it i absolutely hate having to talk about how i feel and what im thinking even if its not about anxiety all of my fear and worry starts and lives in my head and my head only i actually get embarrassed having to talk about that shit im just tired of feeling numb im tired of not having fun im tired of this emptiness and im tired of feeling and thinking so many things i dont understand but this has been my entire life its not an on and off thing its how i think and how i feel constantly and at this point it feels like normal life im scared that no amount of work or therapy will fix it because i feel like i basically have to rewire my entire brain and lifestyle,4
i really struggle with this in person and also at work on webcam whenever i look at peoples eyes it feels like a kind of burning then it just induces a horrible panic feeling too i was once told in therapy to look over a persons shoulder instead but people end up saying what are you looking at i just feel so abnormal not being able to do this,4
just wondering if anyone else made this connection and curious of others experiences,4
so im not too sure if this is the correct place to post this or get advice but id just like to hear what people have to say about it ive been working at my engineering job for years now its a decent job with very good pay and decent hours that work for me but for the same amount of time it has been the main source of my anxiety its quite a tricky job with a lot of learning involved and its taken me a long time to get to grips with ive made a lot of mistakes in the process and with some parts of the job i still feel anxious about what ill have to do or about making mistakes while doing those things the main thing however is the environment and one particular person in it well call him bob say hello bob he used to be my team leader but stepped back from that role to become team engineer still a somewhat ranked role in itself but more technical and is one of the most experienced and gifted guys at the place having been there for decades at this point let me preface by saying a good chunk of the time this guy is ok however bob is very hotheaded and temperamental and can be passive aggressive will openly berate people for innocent mistakes and will make jokes about coworkers and their abilitiesperformance that often seem to have a hint too much opinion behind them often to the point where youre not sure when hes joking and when he isnt he takes his job very very seriously often to the point of some sort of corporate stockholm syndrome devotion that may be an exaggeration but you get what i mean as an example hes gone off on one at me before for not working much overtime and he has commitment and thats why he does loads implying i dont pull my weight by not working weekends etc his whole demeanour makes me extremely uncomfortable and feel intimidated because i dont know when hes gonna be in one of his bad moods or take issue with something its been joked about before whether were gonna get jekyll or hyde today about months ago he openly berated near shouting in front of the whole team and my manager for misplacing a tool during an audit which i understand is a bit negligent but i did find it quickly afterwards it was embarrassing and made me feel small especially since that couldve been handled in a far more professional manner the other day he made a comment about my rate of work rhetorically asking jokingly why i can only do of something while he can do a lot more in the same amount of time funnily enough hes done that multiple times in the past and it never fails to make me feel heightened and worthless i get that im a slow worker and not the most skilled but he makes it out as if im lazy and not bothered about my job i am very much the opposite i just have less experience and work at a slower pace than most because i worry so much about getting things wrong i just dont find bob very approachable and that makes it even more difficult because hes our team engineer which means sometimes i have to ask him questions but its been very often that hes responded to questions as if theyre stupid or something i shouldve known already what doesnt help is that for the longest time the team has enabled his behaviour saying to me dont take it personally its just the way he is even recently when another team member was talking to me like crap and i spoke to my manager about it after finally having enough i mentioned bob and while he spoke to the other person and she hasnt bothered me since he said he wasnt gonna talk to bob at this time because it requires a far more delicate approach from what i understand bob has his own issues one of them being bad anxiety but it seems like hes dealing with it in very unhealthy ways at this point im just not sure what to do i dont feel like i can ask my manager to do something about it because of his bob might react or what he might do its not like the company would do anything anyway because hes so good at his job and does a hell of a lot i could move teams where the work would be more challenging so i could be maliki life harder for myself but if i stay i have to stay in an environment that makes me constantly anxious and seriously affects my mental health to the point where just leaving my job has crossed my mind in moments of madness any advice or ways to maybe cope with this would be really welcomed tldr my job and a person there make me incredibly anxious and i dont know what to anymore,4
i have a job interview in minutes and went to the hairdesser beforehand she asked me if we should wash my hair and i declined bc i dont have enough money so she asked me if i was sure and instantly i felt bad about my hair as i thought it was greasy now im freaking the f out and i dont know how to calm myself i hope the interviewer doesnt look at my hair obviously,4
hi everyone i wanted to just put a note here to see if this is a common symptom people experience even with medication ever since i developed severe anxiety that seemed to arise behind the wheel it started with little things i would hit a bump and would spend a little longer looking in the rear view mirror than i ordinarily would eventually it escalated to the point where i would compulsively circle blocks or pull over just to make sure that these bumps and potholes were not pedestrians and if i did circle a block usually there would be other potholes or bumps which would lead to a mental downward spiral that drove me quite literally to insanity it was one of these spirals that led to my first trip for psychiatric evaluation after beginning medication this generally subsided to a manageable level and with cbt i was doing pretty good then in december of my wife and i were stopped at a red light when us and two other vehicles were completely totalled by an f who rear ended us travelling at roughly kmh he ran from the incident everyone was miraculously not seriously injured but ive been set back to pre medication levels of anxiety while driving this hypervigilance i drive quite a bit has now lead to significant physical illness for me from stress ive ground my molars to completely flat and the tension within my body from being so braced i guess and overly vigilant while driving is really locking me up ive gained a lot of weight too its lead to serious depression as ive built a life that requires me to have a limber body does anyone have any similar stories to share or even just some relevant encouragement im really getting to the end of my rope lately because of this thank you beautiful humans please drive safe and treat yourself gently,4
it feels like im dying my back hurts and my chest feels sore and heavy im scared something bad is going to happen to my heart i vaped a lot these past couple of years and i feel like its taking its toll everyone tells me its anxiety but i feel like my heart is damaged it feels like i might die tonight,4
i recently started dbt after anxiety and depression became nearly unbearable for me and the specific distress tolerance skills and suggestions like hundreds of ideas about specific activities to do when feeling any kind of way has been the most life changing thing ive learned i know dbt is expensive and inaccessible to a lot of people but here is a linkhttpsstaticsquarespacecomstaticdcecfdtcefabcfadbtskillstraininghandoutsandworksheetslinehanmarshasrgpdf to the pdf my group uses the distress tolerance section has a plethora of information and strategies to combat anxiety and low moods and i highly suggest just taking a look in case anything jumps out at you my personal favorite is the tip acronym cold temperatures like a cold shower or ice pack on your face intense exercise for a brief period of time like jumping jacks for one minute paced breathing or breath work sometimes even fast paced breaths for thirty counts then holding as long as you can all of which help trigger a system response that physically changes your state or very sour candy that distracts your brain for a second to snap out of it basically a bunch of tangible ideas to try out during a moment of panic just thought id share if anyone is looking for ideas love you all lt,4
so i havent been to see a doctor in about two years because i was insanely nervous about what they might find i was hit by a car sunday so i finally went to see a doctor today while talking to the doctor i mentioned i get sharp pain right under my ribs often she said it might be my gallbladder and ordered an ultrasound initially i didnt think anything of it but now im up at midnight googling everything i can about gallbladder cancer and convincing myself i have it im and all of my blood tests came back in the normal range both my age and the blood tests are good when it comes to gallbladder cancer the only symptoms i have are the pain and slight persisting nausea i dont know why i cant let this go i would love advice from anyone else that has medical anxiety,4
im a trans guy and my parents found out recently ever since they will randomly bring it up to me usually crying to me about how they feel like theyve raised me wrong and how horrible they must be treating me for me to decide to be a boy obviously theyre transphobic as you might expect these conversations are very anxietyinducing for me and have also negatively effected my mental health otherwise however one of the worst parts is that i no longer feel safe in the house or even in the car if my parents are driving because they literally bring it up whenever they want as long as were alone im just always so much more anxious than i already was with diagnosed anxiety and i have no idea what to do,4

im f when i was i was one of the reasons a girl with anorexia was excluded from her friendship group i feel immensely guilty and have since apologised to her at the time it happened and a few years after i am in therapy and my therapist tells me not to worry about it anymore but i cant help but feel i deserve punishment for what i did like to lose a partner not have a family etc i feel like its just for me to lose out on something because she got something taken away too i definitely faced consequences the teachers didnt like me as much afterwards and i got excluded from a party as well i keep punishing myself and wonder if theres a karmic force out there that will punish me do i deserve punishment should i just let myself be happy i feel like i dont deserve to be happy im not sure if this is my anxiety talking though if theres anyone with some advice or been through similar feelings i would appreciate any input,4
so i was doing the child pose and felt like im gonna instantly sleep right at that moment my heart kicked in pounding i felt so heavy whole body was so heavy then i did cycles of box breathing and my heart was back to normal within seconds still feel jittery and weak after can someone help explaining this please,4
im and my anxiety started with health anxiety and once i learnt how to deal with that it seems to have transformed into intrusive thoughts about past mistakes and how they could affect me now as a child or teenager ages i was just a really attention seeking person i said lots of provocative jokes because i wanted to be different from everyone and sometimes i lied about myself or my family or other things i still have close contact with some of the people who i was friends with when i was a person like that they dont ever bring up anything i said in the past and i dont feel judged by them because of those things but it doesnt change the fact that i really hate myself for acting like that my brain keeps reminding me of all of those things that i spent years not remembering i know that regretting it means i have grown and am not that person anymore but i still feel so guilty and feel like i dont deserve to forgive myself or move on i feel like i should punish myself by remembering those things and never be able to live like they didnt happen i really hate to think that im going to have to live my life having those memories and knowing it was me and noone else who used to act like that i want to just focus on the present but i feel like i dont deserve it i cant even force myself to study because it feels like i dont deserve to be successful in the future does anyone have any advice regarding this i spent the last days beating myself up over something i said when i was i just want to live without thinking about the past like i did before those intrusive thoughts were so intense,4
for instance ill always catch myself doing it if im stressed over like talking to or being around people or waiting for a doctors appointment or things like that does anyone else get that with their anxietystress ive also noticed that when im stressed im noticeably more anxious and my body shaking and thoughts and feelings overall get worse anyone else experience these things haha this sounds stupid but im posting it anyways because im just curious hahaha edit i also get some brain fog not remembering things somwtimes doesnt happen all the time maybe a few times a a week if im particularly stressed and or anxious about something important as well but im not sure if its apart of my anxiety or if it could be something entirely different,4
first i had a particularly bad flairup of ibs maybe a couple of weeks ago i havent had pain from it quite that bad in a good while then i had a cold which i thought was on its way out the small of my back gets a pinched nerve every so often and that flaired up pretty badly and now i might be developing a chest infection from the cold that doesnt seem to want to shift whats going on could it be stress thats causing all of this,4
i struggle from extreme health anxiety and it has exponentially gotten worse a few days ago i discovered two big red dots on my neck and fully convinced myself that i was bitten by a rabid bat either during the daylight or while i was asleep i had a full mental breakdown searched my room for bats and had an anxiety attack i went to see a np and a pa and both told me that it is not a bat bite i have not seen any bats near me and while the doctors told me to calm down i simply cannot today my throat started hurting but i genuinely cannot tell if i am only imagining that it is impacting my life so much and i dont know how to stop being so anxious it has been so hard on me and my friends who i am driving crazy please be kind and maybe you can help talk me out of my frantic rabid state haha,4
ive not had a brilliant experience with ssris and im looking into snris or alternatives for gad im not sure whether i wanna go back to meds or not but i feel untethered without anything thoughts,4
hi i managed to get through my appointment today but they told me i have to come back for fillings and a root canal and now im petrified does anyone have any idea what i can do to relax before and during my appointment and also if anyone can explain what happens during these procedures id be really grateful also im so anyone have any guidance on how to tell my parents i have bad teeth as they expect to be perfect but due to other mental health issues i havent been taking care of them hence my cavities also how do you know to trust a dentist is it normal for them to look in your mouth for like a minute and tell you what needs to happen they didnt take xrays btw tia,4
i have chronic anxiety i dont want to take my pills everyday as my family has addiction issues at every twist and turn but im a mom i have an almost year old and my husband is military so hes gone sometimes when hes gone my son likes to act up doesnt want to listen at all im working on it with him im trying to be productive my anxiety poses a pretty big difficulty as it turns into pretty bad irritability and aggression when im dealing with frustrating situations the only way ive found to help which it actually doesnt is to take on a bland monotonous tone im struggling to find other ways to communicate with him so that were both calm and hopefully things can get resolved peacefully i just feel so bad when it ends up being too much and i snap at him,4
i got this weird virus its not the flu or covid but right before i got sick i got so panicky for a few days and then once i got sick my panic got x worse ive been sick for a week now and since ive been so sick ive been sad because i wanna get better so im having some negativesad thoughts it sucks because this didnt happen till i got sick i also read that having a virus lowers dopamine and seratonin so that could be what im experiencing,4
every time i find myself having fun or being in love with someone i cant help but think about how one day theyll die it robs me of all joy,4
anyone feel super awkward simply walking into a crowded room or even just lightly populated awkward like where do i look am i walking normal are people looking at me not in a narcissistic way but a low self confidence way ive had this issue my entire life this could be as simple as being at a somewhat crowded gym completing a set in a designated area and walking across the room to grab paper and sanitizer spray to wipe down my station or walking past a parked car with people in it is this a different level if anxiety or are there others out there who experience this,4
hey so this is a pretty weird situation im in but ive only just realized that my recently turned severe anxiety could possibly have a connection to me getting goosebumps all the time first i get a bad full body chill from high stress and boom my skin is goosebumpified for the entire day its just a weird symptom that i wonder anyone else had,4
i wish these past few months were all a joke life really said oh lets make all these bad things happen to her and see her suffer yay bonus points because life made my hereditary anxiety pop out at full force to it first started when my dog started to act not normal her head would keep tilting every which way like she was drunk and eventually kept looking at the ceiling it got so bad to the point where she couldnt walk or wouldnt eat anymore it got worse during the weekend and we dont have an emergency vet near us so we had to call an on call vet from our clinic to come and look at her he didnt really say much about her just figured that it was neurological my mom planned to bring her back to her regular vet on monday so they could further help her she kept having seizures throughout the day as well and had labored breathing my mom laid with her on the couch at night and watched the clock waiting for am to arrive my dog didnt make it through the night she died at in the morning i woke up that morning to my mom and dad telling me that she passed away i got up out of my bed and quickly walked to the living room because i wanted to be with her she died laying in her little bed that she loved my family came and sat around her crying and telling her that we love her i didnt want it to be real i wanted to say mom dad shes just sleeping shell wake up and start barking any minute but reality came back and thats when i knew this is really happening i went to school the next day i didnt want to i just wanted to stay in my bed all day and sleep i was so tired i couldnt even pay attention to what the professor was saying because i felt numb and detached from reality after i got out of class i started feeling like i couldnt breathe it hit me like a ton of bricks my chest hurt bad too i started to take my anxiety pills again after that i never had anxiety this bad before i realized its not like a cold that you can shake off it sticks with you everywhere you go for a long time i started off getting shortness of breath and chest pain then it turned into feeling like my skin and heart were on fire and panic attacks that would jolt me awake at night and keep me up until am it did get better with time once i learned how to manage it a few weeks later i was sending out reminders to my bridesmaids that dress shopping was coming up i had reminded them months before because i wanted to make sure everyone could be there i hadnt heard from one of my bridesmaids in about a month so i reached out to her to see if she was doing ok she hadnt given me a response the next day i asked if she was still coming no response on saturday we arrived to the boutique to pick out bridesmaid dresses she didnt text or call and didnt show either she finally texted me the day after telling me she was backing out of being a bridesmaid i was fine with that but wish she had communicated with me better a few days after that i found a couple of black scuff marks on my car theres a little crack by the marks to turns out somebody side swiped my car and i didnt even see it until now i figured i probably got hit in the college parking lot while i was in class so i called college security and had to meet up with an officer to give them specific time frames to look at in their security camera footage im so sick of people hitting my car i think my car has gotten hit about times now i got so anxious about telling my dad i hope life gives me a break after this i desperately need one,4
it happens every single time people tell me that they care about me and theyre my friend and yet my phone is so dry and this is not an exageration i can feel myself dying from the loneliness,4
so ive worked crappy dead end jobs for the past years and im just sick of this life im sick of getting bitched at by customers while making very low money i dont want to do this anymore i want to finally find a job that pays well and that doesnt make me want to die by the end of the week ive been apply to pretty much anything at this point and i was finally able to get an interview for a supply chain job its entry lvl and the pay is low but its way higher than what i make atm so i want it the only problem is that since ive never had a real or difficult job im scared that i wont be able to land it and if i do somehow land it im worried that ill end up messing up and getting fired how do i get rid of this fear my interview is on friday and im panicking hard right now,4
do you have the will and discipline to treat it as important as it is,4
i am really struggling right now and to make matters worse i am out of town for work for about the last or hours i have had this sensation of butterflies in my stomach and an uneasy feeling that i cannot kick ive had anxiety issues for years and my recent physical and blood tests say i am healthy but i am worried this is something worse than anxiety i cannot figure out anything to do to get rid of this feeling and it is awful tempted to go to the er but that usually results in several hours of more motoring and being told anxiety unfortunately i do not have any medication like xanax so i am feeling really lost and scared does anyone else have anxiety present like this and for such a long period of time,4
meeeeee,4
was standing in a room full of people for a work presentation i was at the front and wasnt the focus but could be seen by many i was bored so my mind was just humming along then intrusive thoughts came then a worse one then i was thinking i need to leave then i knew i cant i cant leave i cant have space i am stuck i need to run then the room started kinda spinning and i got light headed i grabbed a chair and sat down nobody really cared but if i had not found a chair i dont think i could have lasted without making a scene or passing out i guess this is about intrusive thoughts spiraling out of control i didnt get a good nights sleep last night maybe that could have happened,4
im and i used to always have rlly bad episodes where i felt like i was physically sick i couldnt sleep breath or my heart didnt work properly i started medication about a year ago and for the most part like everything basicallt stopped since i never was like a thinking anxiety much type of person but now idk i feel like i lost so much of myself due to not having anxiety in a way idk how to describe it besides from my emotions not being so severe which is good but also not what im used to as well as my grades are doing so bad and i have a constant thought of the world not being real i literally have no modivation about school and im doing so bad to my standards of what im used to im not sad but im not happy either and things do not excite me as much i guess i also feel like i never had anxiety despite being diagnosed by different people i feel like i have so much to say and i think so much about life and different things but i dont at the same time its really confusing for me and i just wanted go share somewhere,4
im s f feeling hurt by this interaction with a friend of a friend also s f who i thought might want to be friends with me but evidently doesnt and need help processing itsome feedback on it on top of my social anxiety i have other anxiety disorders depression and am possibly on the spectrum so socializing is extra extra hard for me and i really am lacking in friends heres the situation july was at a friends wedding out of state and met one of her other friends who lives in my state about min away from me we hit it off and she said shes always looking for new friends and it would be cool to grab dinner sometime dec i never hear from her and reach out to find out about dinner and we schedule something but end up canceling because she has a family emergency feb i check in about how shes doing if she still wants to do dinner and we schedule a dinner our mutual friend happens to be in town so it ends up the three of us at dinner together july pandemic is happening she includes me on an email invite to her bday party at her house i dont feel comfortable going so decline june i am feeling lonely and reach out to find out how shes doing and if shed like to go to this outdoor concert with me she ends up not being able to make it that day but says we should one day meet up for dinner and i agree i remind her we had talked about some greek place that time we went out and she says yeah lets do dinner soon september never heard from her about dinner and reach out again she says her next two months of weekends are booked with fall activities with friends she mentions a few shes doing that i could join i tell her id be interested in this farm visit shes doing she tells me itll probably be some weekend in oct but shell let me know the details once it gets closer and she and her friends decide the exact day i never hear anything march now get a random text from her asking how im doing i get excited thinking shes interested in reconnecting im feeling extra depressed and lonely and friendless as more friends have moved awaylost touch she asks if i still live where i used to and if i still work remote yes and yes i ask how shes doing but shes vague only telling me she saw another friend of our mutual friend recently and that she still lives in the same town then she says the reason she is reaching out to me is because she has a friend who is single and she thought of me she sends me all his details and asks if i was interested man did i get so depressed i thought she had been interested in reconnecting because she was interested in a friendship with me and regrets we never ended up hanging out again i kept expecting her to suggest we meet up or something but it turns out she is only interested in me for a potential date for her friend i feel hurt that heres someone i wanted to be friends with who i for the hundredth time thought might want to be friends with me and i again feel rejected i know i could once again ask if this woman wants to grab dinner for the th time but i feel ridiculous at this point and like a loser she clearly is not interested in hanging out with me or i wouldnt have had to be the one to reach out to her every time and she would have followed up on those details about the farm visit back in that she did go on what do you all make of all of this tldr heard from someone who i had been previously trying to befriend for the first time in nearly years thought she was interested in the friendship but really reached for another reason made multiple attempts in the past to hang out with no result and feel like a loser trying again cant tell if she really is disinterested in friendship or if my anxiety etc is skewing things,4
so ive reached the point when i amassed enough courage to ask for an appointment with a psychiatrist ive done therapy for about years and never was brave enough to ask my therapist if i had either anxiety or depression but months ago i started with chronic tensional headaches finished college and found two jobs ended up very stressed which i controlled after a neurologist prescribed me pregabalin however ive been struggling with other somatic symptoms that lead me to say okay you waited too much its time to do it even though i hate the idea of being that selfdiagnose person ive been doing a lot of reflection and truly believe i have several symptoms of anxiety perhaps social or general anxiety i will be seeing this doc who was very recommended to me and i fear judgment but much much more fear is if i get prescribed meds that mess me up worse i know shes an outstanding professional she has appropiately medicated my bfs niece for anxiety and honestly doubt id need something strong but im so scared of start taking meds i fear theres no turning back from it i fear it changes me so badly that i have bad moments at my job in front of everyone like crying or a panic attack or that i make an embarrassment i dont want to lose my job since it there are two but the full time one has helped me to get out of my lifeless and procrastination days havent seen my therapist lately since she had a temporary license and now im also unsure if i should come back because she never made me a diagnosis my general doctor told me to come back to therapy asap sorry for the long post id like to know if someone relates to this or your experiences but mostly if you know about meds and if im just panicking too much or maybe i just need to know this before meeting the psychiatrist,4
its been days but i have been super paranoid about this my friend and i were hanging out and i dont remember how it was necessarily brought up but she said i know a girl who is very pretty but she doesnt shower and then asked do you think she knows after i told her idk it depends cause for some people they do and others they dont then she asked btw how often do you shower ive beeb freaking out ever since then that she was throwing a hint that i dont stink but i have asked two people i trust that same day if i stink and they said no but what she said was too odd and random for it to not be a hint although she did ask me for a hug before leaving after the whole thing happened so maybe it wasnt about me i have always had anxiety surrounding this issue because growing up i couldnt afford to shower everyday like i do now so i feel like she accidentally triggered me i genuinely cant tell if she was throwing a hint or what,4
hi everyone i was posting to see if anyone else suffered from anxiety and has heart issues going on as well i have severe anxiety and im definitely a hypochondriac so i started taking zoloft months ago to help however for years i have dealt with heart problems my heart rate gets super high to the s at rest i get dizzy chest pain and i have a lowish blood pressure on top of that i also noticed a couple months ago this feeling i get where i feel like my heart skips a beat and my breath gets taken away which i discovered was me having pvcs i have done numerous ekgs which have been abnormal but my one cardiologist told me im a year old otherwise healthy person so its fine i did an echo and stress test days ago so im awaiting those results one of my previous cardiologists told me he believes this all stems from stress and anxiety and once i manage that it will go away which i agree with to an extent i had another cardiologist tell me that even if im stressed out having a heart rate sustain in the s is abnormal i am also a nurse so i cant tell if me having an understanding of medical stuff makes it more difficult for me to handle because im constantly thinking worst case scenario i have this overwhelming fear that im going to be one of those people in their s that has a heart attack or other complication ive seen people post on here previously saying their heart rate goes super high when theyre anxious but i wasnt sure if anyone had similar experiences as me or knows anything about this im sure i am overthinking this but i also dont like the fact that i constantly have chest pain and a high heart rate,4
does anybody else experience this like i feel my life is going ok rn and then i get hit with dread then i look for answers as to why and i end up thinking zombies climate world ending stuff and not sure how to cope with it these dread feelings happen a lot at night too but when the dread feeling hits my mind wonders to all the bad and i was wondering if anybody else gets this as i have been struggling and i want to know im not alone,4

my first time posting here and i just needed some place to vent ive been on sertraline since i was now my anxiety ties into my ocd i tend to wash my hands a lot double or triple check if something is where it needs to be i also have health concerns for example i bought a posture strap helper i was adjusting it and peeling the velcro back something splinter like jammed into my finger im assuming its part of the velcro as its really strong my anxiety and ocd has been going wild since then heck i even put antibacterial ointment and a bandaid on it after washing it im returning the product and emailed costumer service this condition can be so tiring i joke with people that i feel like a hostage negotiator while also being the hostage taker and hostage or the spiderman meme i just needed to vent and put things into words on how my mind is doing,4
anyone with anxiety around surgery have nose surgery my main way of calming myself is breathing or box breathing and am a little nervous that my nose will be all blocked up guess i better start my mouth breathing also get anxious when on pain killers like i am out of control i cant relax and get anxious that the fatigue will cause me to pass out i have the freeze response my wife tried to remind me the pain killers are there to help and to let my body just handle it plus i hate the anesthesia part when they cover your mouth in the waiting room not that ill die just feels unnatural like a forced nap my wife just reminds me that she would rather be asleep during the surgery just wish i could really take that mindset,4
the string snapped the tiredness anxiety and depression became too much so i decided to press pause and take some time out to recharge i have taken sick leave from my job that exacerbated my anxiety im going to start on anxiety medication again im in counselling and im going to look at starting cbt enough is enough its time to get my life to how i want it to beim not being held hostage by my anxiety any longer,4
ive been trying to get back to work again because it seems my severe depression and anxiety wont go away and there is only so much medication and therapy can help me of course i havent tried every kind of therapy but what had been offered to me at low cost but ive tried many medications anyhow i feel very frustrated because after trying couple of online part time jobs like writing marketing stuff on websites and finding myself not motivated enough to work sufficient hours to make ends meet im trying to start from zero again and do some career tests to find what motivates me but those tests dont offer some magical information but just rely on what youre passionate about like they give you questions and ask you how much you like doing different activities like installing cabinets diagnosing disease in people giving financial advice to someone wanting to get a loan helping a disabled person get dressed playing a musical instrument in front of an audience taking care of sick animals etc etc etc i hate them all none of these activities excite me because having a job is always about what others expect of you but mental illness sucks so much of your energy that there is so little left for the job like if im a cashier my high anxiety and depression and the various thoughts and emotions and physical symptoms i experience will take so much of my energy to control and nothing left to put on a smile and make a customer feel welcome and at the same time do my job of scanning items very quickly and correctly thats why ive been trying to find jobs that are just online and things i can do on my own time so that whenever the damned mental health issues give me a break then i can do the job the problem is there are too many people doing these jobs and they pay so little that ive had to start looking at other options damn it i dont know what i want to hear from you to be honest i mean i already am so filled with selfhatred and hatred for the world i am working myself into anger just writing about it,4

for a while i thought i was okay for a while i didnt feel socially anxious i dont know what went wrong but the thought of social interaction or going out into public spaces scares the hell out of me for a while i never went grocery shopping because i just didnt want to deal with people i dont want to talk to my classmates at all i would feel more better about hiding and not having to deal with anyone one of the most recent issues thats sending me into a spiral is that i need to do a task that involves leadership and giving directions but its difficult for me to communicate its as if the words are all sprawled out in my head and whenever i make an attempt at talking it just comes across as disorganized and incoherent im not a leader i cant direct id rather follow than lead today was especially horrible because im generally a well organized person who has it together but my classmate ended up seeing how much of a mess i am after something fell out of my plan i got flustered shut down entirely its so embarrassing and now i want to hide from everyone i dont know how to recover from something like that or show that im better than my anxiety,4

when i was talking to her about my difficultmanipulative relationship with my dad and how he suddenly started ignoring me over the smallest thing she asked me how i felt about it when i said that i was feeling angry then she asked me what else i said maybe also disgust of him then she again said what else i got stuck for words because well thats it im not sure that i feel anything else but she was waiting for the answer and i answered something like confusion then she again asked me the same question and i told her thats all and this is the part im not sure about she then said i think you also feel sadness tell me do you want to cut contacts with him i told her that probably yes im ready for this and determined to do it but she implied that this is not what i want and told me to think about it and tell her on the next session since then i feel really uncomfortable with her and im thinking about leaving therapy i dont know maybe i just overthink and its not what its actually like,4
i have been struggling with health anxiety and general spiraling lately along with a host of other mental health issues my psychiatrist recommended i try getting back on an antidepressant as they can sometimes help with anxiety and my healthy dose of depression needs to be managed we are thinking of prozac since i responded well to it when i was younger anybody on here who responded well to ssris specifically in terms of their healthgeneral anxiety prozac in particular would love to hear some success stories because tbh i am very anxious about starting but am desperate for relief,4
there is nothing worse than when you get to self checkout and there are literally no bags theyve started doing this at chains around me long ago and i still miss plastic bags bringing reusable bags feels like putting a target on my back not quite literally but i feel like i stand out as one of the few people usually entering with something in my hand that ill probably put my groceries in while shopping,4
in the recent few years ive very well acknowledged that i am a pretty anxious person and i kinda got used to it but something that still bothers me is my separation anxiety and the constant fear of being abandoned by my friends i dont know how to go about it especially now that i have a best friend to whom i cant talk all the time whenever i want or need to they seem to be more of the avoidant style i find it very difficult to go through my day if whenever i think of them and talking to them i have to stop myself and give them space i dont mean this in a selfish way naturally i am a pretty understanding person i try to control my urges for contact which i crave a lot but its been getting harder as the days go by most of the time i dont even have something important to say its just my thoughts and things i mention throughout the day but i feel blue when i remember that they do not prefer texting everyday because that is something that i really like want and need i try my best to respect their boundaries and i am the one to adapt to their needs for space just recently i started wondering whether it is okay that i bring this up as a boundary and a need of mine i feel like ive often been the one to change for them and its been getting to me lately i dont mean any harm to my bestie and we dont have any other unsolvable problem except for this one is it okay to text them is it selfish i get a lot of thoughts and i address them as anxiety but it doesnt get any easier even when i am fully aware of that i just wish to put an end to this it has been affecting my mood lately i check the messages app hundreds of times only to see no texts from them i get anxious waiting for a reply and even more anxious when i first think of something to say it just pops into my mind and i happily open the app but as soon as i start typing i remember the situation and feel guilty about texting them but then again i feel very empty if i dont how do i go about this,4
hello all i am m and been struggling since december when i had a marijuana induced panic attack first time smoking and i only did it to make my sister feel more comfortable with smoking since its something she enjoys like an idiot i took an absolutely heroic bong rip and had a full mental breakdown for the next hours before i finally woke up and felt mostly normal i felt okay the next day and then after a week i was very stressed at work and out of nowhere got extremely dizzy to the point i was scared for my life i drove to the er and they said it was just anxiety so i drove back home and tried to sleep it off didnt sleep at all for days and was terrified the whole time since then ive had constant derealization panic attacks intrusive thoughts depression anxiety and horrible physical symptoms like dizziness random headaches that come and go all over my head body pains stomach pain etc since then ive had rounds of blood work ct scan mri seen an ent and a neurologist ive also been given all of the following medications and more prednisone meclizine clonidine zyrtec flonase antibiotic ear drops none have worked all my tests have shown nothing physically wrong so id say its fair to diagnose as anxietyrelated though my therapist im new to therapy since this all began says hes never had a client with such severe dizziness and brain fog ive been on zoloft for weeks now and id say it is finally helping somewhat i have changed doses twice from to and to in that time so im still adjusting i was also taking quetiapine mg as a sleep aid for a few weeks but i can sleep without it now so i stopped because i wasnt thrilled about taking an antipsychotic for offlabel use to begin with overall i would say i am at about when i started the zoloft i felt around honestly i was convinced i was going insane and would need to be in an institution during those first weeks i have been housebound and on medical leave this whole time so what im trying to do to get back to my feet is exercise daily get outside drive to my apartment hr and work remote a few hours a day i am soldiering through these tasks and honestly i do feel better when im busy for example when i play the playstation i can push the symptoms to the back of my mind but the rest of the time it feels like my conscious mind only has awareness while the rest of my mind is lost somewhere else and doing its own thing it also feels like my short term memory and vision are impaired but theyre not its like being stuck in a dreaming state and its so scary and frustrating its very hard to describe but i dont have any delusions or hallucinations so i dont believe i am suffering from a psychotic illness i have suffered through so much in my life without it physically impeding me or making me question my sanity but these last months have really tested me over the last years ive struggled with anxiety and depression but i was able to power through degrees a long distance relationship a breakup and building a career i would hardly have dreamed of years ago i know i am strong and have what it takes to get through this but the battle is certainly long and difficult it is unlike anything id have ever fathomed a human could experience it is so overwhelming that its easy to think it may never end i think it will be okay over time because i believe in the power of the human mind and body to adjust to challenges but i wanted to share my experience and see what others may think i will be so grateful when i am healed and healthy because this experience has given me so many insights on what it takes to have a happy and meaningful life ive learned lessons in gratitude kindness and compassion that i want to share with others ps i really look forward to getting back to the things i enjoy once im better bodybuilding soccer vinyls and working,4

if i thought i managed my anxiety poorly before oh boy this last month has been easily the worst in terms of anxiety ive ever experienced my first born is due in two months farming season is about to start constantly awake until am reeling about the real possibility of financial ruin due to the costs of having a child and the current state of the agricultural industry the thought of changing careers only amplifies my anxiety x thats the worst part being unable to sleep sometimes ill start to go asleep and the slightest noise will wake me up or ill just wake up in a full blown panic ive been spending all day either being a nervous wreck and if im not outwardly nervous my body is still showing physical symptoms of it almost like its subconscious sometimes i feel like the anxiety itself is scarier than the situation i worry myself sick over my other new trigger is every little ache pain or cough i get i spend the entire day spiraling down a hole thinking im obviously dying and i wont be there to see my daughters first steps and the farm thats been in my family for generations will be sold because nobody will be there to take care of it i hate the physical symptoms the most the fast heartbeat constantly being on edge body and headaches its like even if i think im getting a rope around my anxiety its still there in my subconscious wreaking havok on me im sorry if this was convoluted or hard to follow i just dont have many people i can talk to and if i can they have a hard time understanding just how hard this affliction makes things these things im worried about are valid certainly anybody who isnt nervous about having a kid isnt in their right mind i suppose but having a generalized anxiety disorder coupled with panic attacks in the first place just makes it hell on earth and makes you not only question your own abilities but also question your own sanity at times,4
hi everyone this is my first time posting on here and this may turn out to be an essay but please bear with me and read to the end i promise to make this as concise as possible im in my late s male and have had anxiety since the beginning of high school it felt super overwhelming back then and high school could have been an amazing experience had anxiety not gotten in the way i went to university fairly late and after graduating kept landing contract work and eventually got stuck working at the same grocery store i applied to as an undergrad the anxiety carried over into the workplace and resulted in my inability to work at a fast pace i always felt mentally and physically exhausted this is where i have to mention alcohol and caffeine both of which produce superhuman like effects but with a caveat i tried alcohol for the first time in montreal at the age of and after downing beers it felt like i had ingested an elixir my worries went away instantly and felt my brain firing on all cylinders there were negative emotions and a profound combination of confidence energy euphoria and heightened creativity i never got addicted to drinking for obvious reasons and only drink on occasion but every time i do it produces the same effects i also never get drunk coffee seems to produce eerily similar effects and i realized this a few years ago after i had a coffee at work and felt like i had snorted crack i thought i could take on the world and was super excited that i had finally found a solution to my problem unfortunately however if i have coffee everyday for days straight by the th day it produces the exact opposite effects and im left feeling sleepy and lethargic for me to feel the full effects of coffee i need to refrain from it for at least days fast forward to today where i recently started working construction as a sprinkler fitterpipefitter and absolutely hate it apart from being a fastpaced environment im asthmatic with an allergy to dust and constantly drilling holes into a concrete ceiling has made my asthma worse plus the cement we use to glue the plastic leaves me with a pounding headache during and after work so i know my days are numbered the company that im employed with is currently waiting on a new project so ive had the last days off during this time ive begun doing research on career alternatives and have become very interested in the online world and have decided to upgrade my skills in ecommerce digital marketing and video editing among other things my morning routine involves getting up at oclock feeling tired having breakfast followed by tea with milk which produces similar effects to coffee with much less intensity after having tea my anxiety goes away and i become very focused however when the caffeine wears off my anxiety returns and i go back to feeling mentally exhausted constant worrying overthinking fear of failure lack of motivation etc as far as i know im not depressed nor do i have low selfesteem i feel good about the way i look and the shape im in going to the gym helps i dont have any bad habits i dont smoke nor do i indulge in social media looking for a dopamine fix most of my free time is spent reading online and on youtube searching educational videos i also get to hours of sleep every night but usually wake up tired the only complaint i have with life is my anxiety without it i have a powerful personality and i feel like im capable of achieving so much but its causing me to operate at only of my full potential i was wondering if anyone is able to offer any insight as to why alcohol and caffeine produce such similar effects practically eliminating my anxiety before the effects wear off and if anyone has had similar experiences could alcohol and caffeine contain something which i might be deficient in could i get this in a pill form i was thinking of making an appointment with my family doctor but just thought id reach out here to see what the members here have to add im open to the idea of trying antidepressants but at the same time worried about the side effects do antidepressants really only cause side effects in the first couple of weeks based on some of my research that seems to be the case apologies for the long post and i would greatly appreciate any input thanks,4
hello first time posting here but i feel like im going to explode so a few weeks ago i got the amazing idea to get blonde highlights like a balayage i dont know if its because how the hairstylist did them because my hair is wavy or im just this insecure but now every time that i see myself on the kinrara i hate my hair so much like what the hell i did to my precious color im thinking to get dyed at home because i cant deal anymore with hairstylists and giving explanations but it makes me so anxious to not get a color that matches my hair i just want my highlights to dissappear im feeling like a mess and i dont know how to proceed and i dont want to hear the others saying how im wasting my money after getting the highlights i just want to feel peace at something,4

dont understand why this is happening but i have been having panic attacks when im stressed out its really weird i do struggle with depression diagnosed but not medicated but never really had an issue with anxiety until now i can only pinpoint one specific traumatic moment this year but i really am not seeing why especially when the trigger isnt anything related to that i just shut down now under any stress which sucks because sometimes my work is stressful and the panic attacks have happened twice in my work place im just wondering if anyone else had this sudden onset of panic attacks for no reason edit i forgot to mention but im in therapy and have mentioned this to my therapist but i am finding these episodes continuing to occur and it scares me,4
recently ive become a lot more aware that when i overthink something i often dont look for evidence that that thing is true i instead simply catastrophise without receiving the information which actually may disprove what im thinking a common reaccuring thought in this is that my boyfriend is mad at me that my friends are mad at me and overall the overarching fear that ive done something wrong from personal experiences can anyone give me some personal self help techniques to reduce catastrophising and overall thoughts that are extremely blown out of proportion,4
i am a med student and currently i am at the worst state i have ever been my anxiety is the highest ever and i keep having suicidal thoughts i try to calm down and help myself but i cant because everyday i have to go to classes because they are mandatory and every time i go it just keeps me stressed and i can never escape this loop unfortunately i have started drinking more alcohol to try to suppress my anxiety but i know this isnt good i dont know how long i can keep up my hopes are that i can keep up till summer and then take a leave of absence for years to fix myself and figure out what i want to do with my life but i dont know if i can persevere till summer,4

im at work constantly trying to clear my throat and googling how to cough up phlegm even though im not sure that it is phlegm i cant concentrate on anything else and im worrying that i have a disease i havent done any work in the last minutes because i keep googling and getting up when im restless considering leaving work early to go home but i know itll sound stupid i also know that my reaction to overpowering anxious thoughts is to leave wherever i am and go home so i know the reason for wanting to go home isnt because i feel physically sick enough i wish i could just sit with this mild physical discomfort and cough every now and then like a normal person but instead every time i feel the thing in my chest a wave of anxiety paralyses me i dont know how to get through the day what should i do,4
edit thanks for all the advice everyone this situation is extremely nuanced and very complex and im unable to fully convey how something like this can even happen make it make sense without giving up specific details about my school prof situation because yes im aware this situation sounds absolutely ridiculous the comments have been really helpful in next steps and how to help with the anxiety appreciate it ampxb,4

hello this is a short story that at least for me it was a great anxiety relief if you like it i will post more once upon a time in a serene village nestled within a lush green valley there lived a gentle wise elephant named elara this village was known for its tranquility as it was graced with a unique energy that seemed to ease the worries and stresses of all who lived there one day a young girl named mia came to the village seeking relief from her overwhelming anxiety upon hearing about elaras wisdom she ventured to the peaceful grove where the elephant resided the moment mia approached she felt her heart rate slowing and her breath deepening elara ive heard of your wisdom and calming presence please can you help me with my anxiety mia asked timidly elara looked at her with gentle eyes and replied of course dear child sit down beside me and let me share with you the secret to finding peace within yourself as mia settled down elara began to tell her a story long ago our village was visited by a wise old monk he too had experienced the tranquility of our valley and wished to uncover the source of this peaceful energy he spent many days meditating under the ancient oak tree at the center of the village finally he discovered the secret within each of us exists a tiny peaceful oasis an inner sanctuary that remains untouched by the chaos of the world the wise elephant continued to access this sanctuary you must learn to quiet your mind and listen to the rhythm of your own breath begin by taking slow deep breaths inhaling through your nose and exhaling through your mouth with each breath imagine your worries dissolving into the wind leaving only peace and tranquility behind mia closed her eyes and followed elaras guidance as she inhaled and exhaled she felt her anxiety ebbing away replaced with a sense of calm and safety she had never known before after some time mia opened her eyes and looked at the wise elephant thank you elara your words have brought me peace and i will carry this lesson with me wherever i go as mia prepared to leave elara touched her trunk gently to the girls shoulder remember dear child your inner sanctuary is always within you whenever you feel overwhelmed or anxious simply close your eyes breathe deeply and allow yourself to find refuge in the peaceful oasis of your heart with newfound strength and a heart filled with gratitude mia returned to her life carrying the wisdom of elara and the tranquility of the village with her she had discovered the power of her inner sanctuary and now she was ready to face the world with courage and serenity,4
tw selfharm bad thoughts im not really sure what else sorry so uh ive been feeling down and really anxious for thr past few weeks its probably silly but i cut myself a while ago snd i hadnt done that for a while so i think its really getting a low point and its probably just because of my poor emotional regulation stuff but i kinda need to get this out because i dont have anyone else to talk to about this to start with my academic workloads increased these past few weeks im doing a research paper with a group but its just stressing me out im um overthinking about how it would fail or if im not a good leader and im affecting my classmates grades because of it its just well the thought of it is always there and i cant really get rid of it because its not yet done then theres this family tree project that we have and im using my moms family with it im not really close with my dads side of the family so i cant exactly switch to his family uh the problem is my mom has problems with her family and i dont want to bring it up so i keep putting it off i dont want to make her upset and the thought of doing so is just making me anxious theres also the little things exams quizzes presentations etc i failed a quiz for the first time in a few years and my teacher got upset about it so im kinda panicking and trying to review more haha then well my birthdays coming up we had this whole catering thing going on but theres been problems with the payment and stuff mom made a mistake because she was outside when the manager asked for the payment and she got really stressed because she couldnt get her money back the manager hasnt exactly been cooperative and theyve been insistent on the payment so yeah mom got angry and kinda blamed me cause i was the one who liked the idea of the catering thing i promised her that i would take care of it since it was mostly my fault since she didnt like it but i pushed so ive been in contact with the manager and everything but the situations still messy its just more stress more anxiety hooray i guess were still not done with the preparations and stuff and i really want to help but ive been busy with school and when i get home theres no time to go outside and get whats needed its stressing mom out and i think thats part of the reason why she got angry so i wanted to get this done but i cant and i have to wait for the weekends to actually be able to do stuff theres also the scholarship tests although ive already taken them its just making me nervous because if i didnt pass then it would be difficult to go to college becaude my family isnt really financially stable its just pressuring me i think im having trouble identifying how i feel without wanting to break down lol its also hard to fall asleep i feel like the only rest i get is the minutes before i fall asleep so i try to prolong it as long as possible i think im afraid of waking up tomorrow because it just means that nothings resolved yet and i just yeah uh thats it i guess sorry if this is all negative if you have some advice especially about the sleeping thing its all welcome thanks,4
i am so exhausted and just need to know that i am not alone i have been struggling with health anxiety since october of it started off with the fear of seizures no family history no increased risk and now its onto heart attacks and cardiac arrests ive had ekgs a hour holter monitor and an echocardiogram all came back normal my cholesterol is fine blood pressure is fine i dont know how to get over this irrational fear of uncertainty and unknown i feel the constant need for control and i dont know how to stop i am currently in weekly therapy and have just started hypnotherapy,4
i wake up and i instantly check my phone making sure of everything i have to do in the day then double checking then triple checking then i go to school and the nail biting and skin picking starts then the headache then my heart starts racing and everything goes blurry and this week has been horrible i have felt so anxious and stressed that i keep throwing up and having panicanxiety attacks i just wish i could get a diagnosis,4
so before i start let me make clear that i do have some health issue well had i was born with a unicuspid valve and had open heart surgery years ago up to the surgery i was a mental wreck more than before now after the surgery ive been well for the most part i have had alot of fears after that actually got worse over the two years instead of better now to start this story up we gotta rewind a few months its a few days after christmas im at granny inlaw having a good time when my girlfriend notice my right ankle is a little swollen above the achilles tendon we call the emergency eoc and he wants ud to come in he frels it and want it scanned with ultrasound it was fine now i didnt think much of it then but im sure my ankle above the achilles always was swollen but i havent ever really looked much at my ancles now here is where it gets difficult two days later we are home i wake up and notice i have a coin sized point bit left from my sternum with minor painand i get spells of dizziness at night i get admitted to the er and they do ultra sound ekg bloodwork work etc and everythings fine except from slightly elevated troponin which could be scar tissue though they think i have a minor infection in my heart and release me sayinf i should be fine sfter some time but i dont feel fine onde home i get this feeling of not being able to get enough air when i breath a week later im back in the er they do the usual checks plus a ct and guess what im fine except for the same slightly elevated troponin and they release me again sayings its just a minor infektion weeks later i have an appointment with a specialised cardiologist that is educated for valve disease and has byen following me for over a decade she checks me and im fine my heart is in a good condition now i didnt feel happy when told so but extreme dissapointment i started to get a feeling of fear of them having made a mistake or missed something the reason being is that before my surgery the hospital i was in the er at didnt see that my heart wasnt doing well when i was in for chest painwasnt a heart attack but my valve failing badly the same pain i have now now i startede going to a psych every third week and its good but at this point im uncertain of what is wrong ive been checked at the hospital times and at a specialized cardiologist and they havent found much that could explain the pain so im trying to accept the fact it could be anxiety driven but the moment i started trying it i got issues with breathing again its like something in me wants to keeper me in pain and afraid i hope some will read this and give some input,4
i have this problem where i refuse to believe anyone knows me i know i sound abit weird writing this but i just cant put my mind around anyone truly knowing me and i know the saying of no one truly knows anyone but it really is becoming a thing where i really believe people dont know me im not a shy person im extroverted i love talking to people but i do have anxiety ive been hurt a lot in the past by people i think everyone has now i just dont think i know anyone and i dont think they know me i know people do know me i just wont admit to it im struggling to understand myself really ive come on here to ask for advice because ive looked into this and all i can find is people saying why dont i let anyone know me which isnt my situation i feel like i dont but i do speak about my problems and im known as an open book so why do i feel this why am i crazy if anyone feels this way or knows why i do please respond,4

i have had severe panic attacks for about years now and just mental anxiety no physical symptoms for my whole life probably it has morphed into health anxiety and being constantly worried that i have a tumor or heart attack or stroke which is an awful way to live they resurface every now and then when life gets stressful but i cannot eliminate my stressors i need to cope with my attacks i am in therapy and take effexor but i need advice from people who actually have suffered like i do,4
the only solution to the things that have me feeling anxious is to wait theres no other way around it and i hate it so much its leaving me with too much time to think and i cant do anything to distract myself because that just fuels my anxiety in some weird roundabout way i cant even find the words to vent my emotions properly because my mind is so muddled im not able to distract myself much so i dont know what to do,4
ive suffered from anxiety since middle school and ive definitely always had the hardest time with it in classroom settings im in college now and ive never really noticed my anxiety in any of my classes until now i have one class that because attendance is required and i have to make a bit of a scene to exit has suddenly started making me extremely anxious i find that i suddenly cant breathe and feel like im about to pass out even when im sitting down it got so bad yesterday that i had to leave and i skipped class this morning too after having a fullblown panic attack in that class last night i now have intense anxiety about returning skipping isnt an option anymore but im so afraid of having another panic attack in there any advice is much appreciated thank you so much,4
ampxb so i got drunk on the weekend and today i still feel very weird like my body feels weird my vision doesnt seem right and i just went on a walk and my surroundings seemed not real like i saw a person and they didnt look real i cant explain it i do suffer with severe anxiety and have panic attacks now and then but i have never felt like this like my whole mind feels off,4

been on mg of amitriptyline for about two years now for ibs was put on sertraline today mg for anxiety the doctor knew of my existing medication and suggested starting at mg for a week and then increasing to if i felt ok im sure its safe since it was prescribed but the doc was busy searching through her computerphone once i told her about my amitriptyline and it hasnt filled me with much faith lol has anyone here taken this combo before,4
recently ive been going through a really stressful period of my life and it has also greatly increased my anxiety this makes it especially difficult to sleep i often take hours laying in bed to fall asleep and then wake up about times a night and i cant even tell you the last time i got a full hours i often wake up due to vivid dreams or maybe just due to all the things on my mind which i think may be contributing to poor sleep i often have to take a melatonin in the middle of the night to fall back asleep i also take magnesium supplements sometimes but ive had my ups and downs with them as they tend to increase the vivid dreams i also quit weed sorta recently which may factor into why ive been having so many vivid dreams and having sleep troubles im wondering if anyone has any advice on how i could get better sleep and any other supplements that may help with it if needed i just wanna fall asleep quicker and stop waking in the middle of the nights and i wanna see if anyone here has had similar experiences and if anything helped,4
maybe i am suffering from extreme anxiety because of my low selfworth and my anxiety is limiting me in the things i can do so i even believe less in myself its like a vicious cycle anyway out,4

i tried going cold turkey off my smartphone and my anxiety is going through the roof had to take a valium i just thought that i am spending way too much time on my smartphone that i am addicted hours a day on average so much screen time is like reality avoidance to me and is hijacking my dopamine levels probably overstimulating my brain causing more anxiety longterm tried listening more to music podcasts audiobooks but its not enough i guess i am addicted to my phone anyone have a similar experience and knows a way out,4
so this morning i already bought a coffee and just started to drink it at my desk when a co worker came by and ask if i wanted to go get coffee i said yes and said i will just continue to drink this one i have but he said just get another one for some reason he thought i was finished and said to get another one he did eventually buy me another coffee so i just through out my half drunken coffee in the trash since he bought me one i felt disappointed in myself for not being more clear in this types of situations i have a problem making myself heard clearly and precisely i guess there more work to be done thanks for the vent session,4

hi friends new poster here turns out my entire family suffers from anxiety and nobody shared this with me my mom was medicated for it briefly my dad is medicated for it and also has ptsd and it runs in both sides of the family i figured it out in my early s and i have been seeing all these things about myself in a new light ever since currently suspicious that i might have ocd something i am frustrated with is that i had a lot of signs and symptoms but was quieter than my siblings so it got brushed off all the time in highschool i had one friend and she was always telling me i was a worrywart and openly mocked me about things i did for example i could never just cross a street had to be with the walk signal and then i would run across it and one day she made a big deal about it to my face nobody ever asked why why i had almost no friends why i didnt learn to drive until i was almost why i am always going around giving people warnings about their safety one time i had a complete breakdown after my parents got divorced which was very rare for me and my mom said shes just being dramatic and wants attention and that was the end of that i was also the responsible one they just dont have time for my feelings i try to talk to my dad who seems like the person who would understand the most and ill say i have been figuring out some stuff about driving and being anxious and he will go speaking of anxiety and driving your sister has come along so far in her driving or i will try to tell him i think i might have ocd and he will use this tone of disbelief and try to poke holes in what im saying to him sorry for the long post im just grateful that sometimes i can find places on the internet to talk about it i dont have the worst anxiety in the world but its always there all the time i appreciate that you folks are able to take it seriously thank you for that,4

ive had panic attacks and such but one thing thats a bit more off and on is how anxiety affects my stomach when i had daily stomach pains in elementary school that were unexplained it now makes sense that it was definitely anxiety brewing im going through a period right now where my stomach is just revolting against me i have the urge to go just about all day every day and will sometimes go times a day when my usual is once a day plus its now usually loose which wasnt an issue before the only thing ive found to kind of help is tazo zen tea it does ease the stomach upset a bit but i also cant drink that much of it before making myself nauseouseven more sick how does everyone deal with this in terms of their anxiety i only have this issue on weekdays when i have work im usually normal on weekends so its obviously the anxiety i just feel tortured by my stomach right now i also meditate which only helps for me while im actually doing it so the anxiety comes right back as soon as i open my work computer basically anything soothing for the stomach would be great although i will say i am currently dieting wedding in june and trying to stick to lowpoint foodsdrinks on ww,4

wondering if anyone has had a similar experience whilst having an anxiety disorder where they felt a sudden paranoid feeling i was trying to fall asleep at night and switched off my lights all of a sudden i felt this weird panic and paranoid feeling that there might be some supernatural creatures like a ghost in my room i was eventually able to convince myself that its an irrational thought but was scared for a few minutes i am on therapy and escitalopram,4
this week i started a construction job i wasnt sure about my coworkers and supervisors are nice people but the job isnt what i expected some tasks were understated when i applied for the job and in the interview but the tasks actually require a significant amount of my daily effort also im underpaid relative to what i was paid in my previous job as well as no paid break however the job is minutes from my house so cheaper public transportation so because theyre nice to me patient and welcoming i feel very uncomfortable telling them ill quit even though the job contract says neither party has to give notice also ive always been an agency worker and the idea of having to give weeks notice provides endless anxiety in an agency job i could just phone or text and say i wont return the next day i have no experience telling my supervisor im leaving a job,4
the following is a text i really wanna send this girl in my class i like her a lot she is really pretty i have no idea how she feels about me but the past two girls ive been talking to i never was really upfront about how i felt in the slightest and they both have found their own relationships and it really made me angry with myself for not being honest granted im not actually saying i like her in the text or anything but i feel it would be implied lol but any advice would help we send each other homework and help each other in class but thats it she is really awesome i really dont mean for this to be awkward lol but it probably is anyway i was trying to tell you in class yesterday without everyone hearing and turning around but i thought you looked really beautiful and i just chickened out and didnt say it for some stupid reason but its been eating at me because id rather feel like an idiot who made someone feel good about themselves than an idiot who didnt really trying not to be weird im just trying to get better with this stuff and saying how i feel but i recognize i probably made it weird,4

hello all ive been working for my sisters friends business for over a year now in the span of the last months i have had major anxiety episodes of a week or longer im having another bout of debilitating anxiety and decided that a leave of absence would be best for me to get better or help if i end up needing it i still feel guilty as ive been out a week already but i know i shouldnt feel guilty am i doing the right thing,4
idk if this will make sense but i always have these moments where im really aware of myself and my body and then i start thinking of myself and past self overall and i feel like i dont know myself and like im in a strangers body its freaking me out and im having so much anxiety advice,4
to be honest ive only tried meditating twice now but ive seen amazing results the first time i did it for minutes and immediately after i felt calm enough to send an email to my boss that i was anxious about sending about mins ago i started it again and im honestly so surprised with the result i feel like i can focus on my university goals and can stop myself from scrolling endlessly all of the voices in my head disappear and are replaced with what feels like good leading voice it makes me feel a lot happier knowing i can dedicate minutes of my day to just breathing in absolute silence without having to stress over anything in that time hopefully in the future this can do more amazing things,4
i have been yawning and trying to catch my breath for the past few hours always caused by anxiety and stress from working out it honestly feels horrible like i cant catch my breath and no i dont have asthmaive checked every type of doctor and seen a lung specialist when my anxiety was the worst during covid i decided to have a healthy protein filled snack just now and ate a whole pack of sardines which was g in protein it also had about mg of omega in the packservings and now i feel extremely calm relaxed and can breathe normal thinking of taking at least mg amount of omega everyday to combat anxiety now as it seems to work extremely well has anyone else had this experience,4

hey i have been having really bad health anxiety for the past week in a half pain started in my right index finger i thought it was because i write and type a lot so i started to rest it over the past week my finger has gotten better but other parts of my body have really been hurting one day my shoulders were killing one night i woke up and my back was killing the next day my legs were in so much pain now i am just feeling a bit of pain in my back i am not really active and nothing traumatic happened to me either i think i just have anxiety in general but these pains are really freaking me out i also got blood work done today so im waiting for the results i shouldnt have but i have been searching up my symptoms online and it kind of sounds like ms with pain moving around my body i have never had any medical issue like this before and i am kind of freaking out i am also in my last semester of university and i just want to be done i just needed to rant lol,4
i got my discharge letter from child mental health services and it had the usual things in but it then had a paragraph saying its important to note the patients diagnosis of and anxiety a different psych told me the anxiety is from a different disorder i disagree but still it seems weird i wasnt told or discussed with about it and only anxiety a close family member has gad and another has social anxiety but never heard of it like how they wrote it i dont really care what label is put on me for myself but my new mental health team is going to get this letter and prescribe medicationtherapy accordingly as i do really struggle with anxiety id like to get help for it but this seems like its not a legitimate things and just a passing comment if it helps they removed eupd from the original psychiatrist and added anxiety is it just people dont like diagnosing bpd so used this as a substitute i live in care so although i dont like having the label bpd it does give my support workers different expectations emotional disregulatuion abandonment issues destructive behaviour ive emailed both psychiatrist but it seems as im not their patient amymore they wont respond lol,4
so the other day i had a full blown anxiety attack at work all of the sudden my heart started racing my whole body was shaking so bad i felt like i couldnt breathe and i was terrified the fact that this was happening at work made it worse i was with a coworker and had to run to the bathroom for like minutes to try to calm down i barely calmed down but went back out to help customers i was probably obviously shaking like a lunatic but i did my best to work through it i was honest with my coworker and told them what was going on this is a job that ive been doing on and off for several years nothing bad happened but my life has been chaotic lately and it just snowballed right then and there how do i get over the embarrassment of this happening not only in front of my coworker but customers too i still dont know if my coworker told my boss but if they had im sure my boss would have reached out by now the last time i had an anxiety attack this bad was about years ago so its not a common occurrence but when i go back to work im afraid of it happening again or about repeat customers commenting on it i just feel so ashamed and like a total loser im in my mid twenties this shouldnt be happening i want to hide in bed forever,4

everyone says try drinking more water doesnt work try changing your diet doesnt work deep breathing exercises doesnt work try exercising kinda works but it comes back shortly after my workout ltheanine heard great things about it makes my anxiety worse oh what about magnesium glycinate makes my anxiety worse the only thing that helps me personally other than prescription drugs which i am trying to stay away from is hiking in nature on a sunny day but even then as soon as i leave it comes back i know everyones symptoms are different but shortness of breath is the main symptom i experience even saying a sentence these days i feel out of breathe i wish i can destroy the parts of my brain that trigger anxiety every second im alive,4
for context im i have nasty anxiety and next wednesday im getting all of my wisdom teeth out im going under general anesthesia and this will be my first time ive been pretty anxious about the whole thing but as the days creep closer its been getting worse i talked to my mom who is a long time nurse about my anxieties and she gave me plenty of reassurance but its still just freaking me out im more worried about the anesthesia than the surgery itselfrecovery not worried so much about not waking up but the whole idea of anesthesia as a whole just scares me something about falling asleep immediately and not being in control has always made me anxious i also know all those dumb videos are mostly staged but im worried about not being able to control my mouth once i wake up not sure how loopy itll make me so yeah thats it if you guys have any advice or anything id really appreciate it thanks,4

i obsess a lot over having a passion its really dumb i know but i think its just my brain trying to find a sense of direction after a really bad depressive episode it makes me go in constant circles trying to figure out what activity is going to magically put me on the fast track to happiness even though i know things are not this simple my brain still thinks of things in this way its really stressful to worry about what activities to do and what will make you happy in the long run instead of just living life thats all any of us can do no matter how much we overthink i am upping my lexapro dosage so hopefully that helps i know it takes a month or so for ssris to kick in and i have only been on my new dosage for a week and a half but i dont feel much better i have a therapist too and she hasnt been much help even though she tries i have just been struggling with this weird obsession for so long and i have been through so many cycles i just dont think i will ever break out of this mindset,4

ive had anxiety for years since i was very young i remember being afraid of everything and having phobias of germs getting sick heights flying driving certain foods etc i was constantly scared as a child and eventually as i went off to college when i was i slowly learned to live with my anxiety i tried new things i slowly came out of my shell when i hit everything came to a head i had gone through a major divorce at lived through covid under constant fear i was diagnosed with pcos was moving across the country in may and was the heaviest i had ever been may by august i had lost lbs in almost two months because i was so afraid to eat i was basically crying every single day i couldnt eat and refused to my emetophobia was so strong i could barely move everyday i was in the er multiple times having procedures and ct scans done and no one could find out what was wrong with me it was then that i finally decided that i needed medication i talked to a psychiatrist for the first time i felt like a failure i had been through so much but i couldnt break this fear and horror of food therapy wasnt helping and i had been so afraid of food that no one could get me to eat more than a bite or two for a whole day i was prescribed medication because one of its side effects was to rise my appetite and at first it didnt work i felt again so defeated and exhausted they put me on a higher dose and after a few weeks i felt hungry i had cravings again i felt like finally eating and i was so famished i finally ate a piece of pizza because the cheese looked so good i couldnt not eat it september i decided to start going to the gym i was scared at first i only would go in for minutes times a week i was so weak i had lost all my muscle starving myself october i went to the gym for the first time for an hour i went up to the free weights and was discouraged but then watched some youtube videos and started building workouts i walked my first mile without pain i was eating calories a day i wasnt as afraid november i ate out at a restaurant for the first time in months i had nachos and they were delicious i wasnt afraid i had my colonoscopy and they found ibs and colitis i finally had answers to my stomach pains december i made a big christmas dinner with my partner and roommate and i ate a full meal i was now lifting at the gym times a week january i travelled out of the state on a plane i ate out almost everyday i enrolled back into school for my masters february to now i workout days a week and i walk miles every single day i keep my body on a routine for my chronic illnesses and i eat a focused healthy diet everyday some days are still hard some days have anxiety some days my stomach hurts and i have flare ups randomly but every bad day has five times better ones i focus on the positive i try not to be afraid of anything anymore and even if i am i remember it cant hurt me and ill be okay tomorrow i wish everyone the best of luck in your journey and recovery,4
im just having anxiety i dont know why this is like my rd post on here in one day but i dont have anything else anything is appreciated,4
does anybody have problems with their eyes when they have bad anxiety or one eye in particular my left eye always feels weird almost like there is a veil over it i have been the the eye doc and they said their is nothing wrong structure wise but i do have dry eye i was told today its a tension headache my neck and shoulders are pretty tight and sore as well but my eyes has been doing this long before the tension i am starting to freak out pretty bad,4
lately ive been terrified of going to sleep i dread it all day my anxiety has always been worse at night and it would disrupt my sleep quite a bit occasionally but recently ive been staying up till am every night no matter how tired i am i force myself to stay awake i dont know why im so afraid of falling asleep now i used to love sleeping and looked forward to it its always made me a bit uneasy thinking about how vulnerable and defenseless you are while sleeping but its never been this bad im always convinced that something bad will happen to me or my pets while im sleeping or that ill go to sleep and not wake up in the morning which not too long ago i wouldve been completely fine with i havent had a good nights sleep in almost months now im so exhausted it feels like i find something new to worry about almost every day and those anxious thoughts are always the loudest at night sleep is the last thing i thought id ever be afraid of but here we are i guess,4
when i have alot of anxiety for weeks i get so tired from doing literally nothing just daily tasks etc i even feel out of breath when not active also higher average heart rate and chest lungs heart feels so sorefatigued anyone been through the same,4
tldr does anyone else have fantasies about getting sick or injured and others feeling sympathy for you and how do you move past them for as long as i can remember ive always had fantasies about getting injured or sick and having people feel sympathy for me and take care of me as a little kid when i would play with my toys the stories i made up would always revolve around someone getting injured or sick and others taking care of them ive always felt so embarrassed and ashamed of these fantasies and ive realized i probably bave these fantasies cause all ive ever wanted was someone to notice how much im struggling and actually comfort me and understand how hard everything is for me but these fantasies just make me feel like a terrible person ive never admitted this to anyone just cause of how awful it makes me feel when i think about the reality of my fantasies,4
im still in school i feel like i have friends but no one really likes me every day i come home feeling more like shit and i struggle to talk to anyone i feel like i dont connect with anyone and everyone gets along with each other then everybody thinks im a weirdo because im quiet i hate being like this is this anxiety or am i just overreacting i dont want to give much more details but i really struggle to talk to people unless they make the first move it feels like im a total outcast even teachers dont want to talk to me i dont know what im doing wrong i wouldnt say im ugly or weird besides being quiet what do i do and how do i stop being so anxious when saying even the smallest thing to another person i big myself up everyday and then i come home having done nothing different i just got back to school after a long break since i had surgery and ive been feeling more depressed when coming home from school ever since,4

that being said jessie js description of it on the diary of a ceo made me realise i might have it im perfectly fine performing tasks in x situation but doing the same in y i shake have weakness lifting stuff etc based on environment people etc is this anxiety ive not being diagnosed at all because this is a recent development,4
started thinking about this today when out for a walk as i noticed myself constantly touching my bellybutton and stomach when i was starting to feel that tight anxious feeling i seem to do this without thinking and i am sure to people walking past it looks a bit strange i remember also in the past when i would get anxiety attacks or feelings of even slight panic i would start touching my neck maybe almost unconsciously due to my breathing not sure if it helps but when i am not able to do it easily say when driving or holding something i feel a bit worse if that makes sense these habits have developed very randomly for me over time and seem to come out as soon as i start having symptoms of anxiety and anxious thoughts just thought id ask if any of you have any strange practices you do maybe even as a coping mechanism or way of bracing yourself when your anxiety is heightened anxiety is a strange kettle of fish but hope everyone is coping in their own way and getting through it one day at a time,4
ive been seeing a therapist for a few weeks one of my questions i asked recently is why do i always feel like i want things over with i am not talking about lifeending but it seems like i just want things over with anything when i was in school work hanging out with people going to an event etc etc etc my therapist said we can address it as we go further into our sessions but wanted to know if anyone else feels this way,4

im not talking about a fear of dentists though i have that too what im talking about is the fear of having something wrong with your teath worrying about every speck or black spot that i see checking my gums constantly to make sure that they are ok i spend so much time in front of a mirror and a light checking to make sure there are no new signs of any dental issues this is on top of brushing my teeth after everytime i eat usually its getting so stressful for me to the point where i dont really have the energy to do things that i want to do or hobbies how the heck do i get this under control does anyone else suffer from this i think part of my fear is that a ive had bad experiences in the past with dentistsdental work b ive started taking care of my teeth now but im worried old problems will show up c i dont have the finances for something to go wrong with my teeth i save as much as i can but i dont make all that much so yeah,4
i had a drs appt this am before work about starting meds for anxiety im anxious about taking meds in general and dont want to take ssris long story short i came prepared and specifically asked for one of two meds wellbutrin and buspar the dr supervising physician refused to prescribe either one bc im at a high risk of seizures bc family history alcoholism other meds that was the one i wanted most bc it does depression anxiety adhd and helps w nicotine alcohol cessation the other one was the only other anxiety med i was willing to try and they said no bc it doesnt treat depression only anxiety the hypothesis is that my severe anxiety is the only reason i am able to function with slightlylesssevere depression so they dont want to prescibe it bc the fear is if they treat the anxiety but not the depression i will quickly spiral into a deep depression i havent felt this depressed in quite a while i dont want to take an ssri and it feels like my only option is that or panic attacks wherein i get so stressed out my blood pressure rises high enough to give me nosebleeds like an anime character,4

mine is mostly about past jobs i had that i hated that gave me lots of anxiety and i didnt like how my boss talked to me hers is about past relationship trauma where guys would talk to her wrong andor hit her sometimes shell be explaining how to do something to me and if i dont immediately get it her tone of voice will raise a little which increases my anxiety and weakens my ability to focus which makes her more frustrated with me which makes me angry and now were both triggered and yelling at each other and hurting each others feelings repeat cycle every weeks or so weve been married for a year and a half now ive tried telling her how what she sayshow she says it affects me sometimes but she doesnt think theres anything wrong with what shes doing help,4

httpswwwncbinlmnihgovpmcarticlespmc hello m and i quit vaping months ago after vaping for years and i have no plans on going back picked up this habit in high school peer pressure and it continued because i was in the same group of friends since then vaped here and there in high school and every damn day in college chain vaping mg nic salt pretty much obviously this is my fault but i cant help but think my future is uncertain and i probably fucked up my health my lung has been feeling weird for a few months now and its causing me anxiety its getting to the point where i dont even want to do anything in college that could help my career because i think im going to die in the near future like whats the point im convinced im going to die from lung cancer sometime in the future or cardiac issues ive been having chest pain and its scary i take an snri rn and its helping but the thoughts wont go away its getting to the point where im reconsidering my whole life because i feel like i ruined it im very depressed and anxious about it and i wish i knew vaping was absolutely terrible for you before i even started i know this post may seem dramatic but this is what goes through my head every morning until i sleep i keep thinking it wasnt supposed to be this way ive gotten straight as my entire life been going to the gym eating right im in college about to go into a career path thats exciting and the future potentially could have been great but i have my one single vice that i was too stupid to quit damn idk i just needed to vent because it gets exhausting i feel like i have no one to talk to about this kind of stuff obv my parents dont know about this they just think im very distressed and depressed about school or smt i see all of my peers off doing amazing things with their lives and im just going through this bs its pathetic the person ive become younger me wouldve died if he saw what i turned into throwing away life it seems like just for a little buzz ive been trying to get my friends off this shit too but they prob see me as biased due to my health anxiety with vapingthey are great but i cant help but feel i wouldnt be in this situation if i stayed away from the red flags once one person starts doing it its like dominos and no one thinks twice about it being bad damn my whole life building up to smt and i just jeopardize it over bullshit i just needed to vent the health anxiety is getting bad to the point where im certain cancer or a heart attack is coming and theres no point anymore,4
im prepared to be called all sorts of names ive had people tell me this is unhealthy and to get serious help like i dont know that this will get buried in the flood of posts ill try still my partner is going on a work trip shes been on a couple before but never outside the country it simply terrifies me i want to support her i have severe anxiety i do take medication and get professional help but its still hard the thought of being home alone for days roughly with my partner a hour flight away in another nation worries me i dont know what to say or do im probably nothing more than a burden of a partner and a person in general ive had two funerals in the last two months too im just tired and very very nervous,4
from time to time when my anxiety is acting up i start shivering almost violently all of my muscles clench so hard that sometimes my abdomen begins to hurt it usually appears to be related to feeling cold but not always for example i had a cat attacked by a stray dog a little while back and before i could do anything to help her i nearly fell to the ground i got these chills so bad i had to sit down and take a bunch of deep breaths before i could function i couldnt even look at her or id just start shaking worse i think the correlation to the cold is psychological i walk into a cold room or get out of my warm bed and it starts but usually only when im worried that it might happen to begin with does this sound like a standard anxiety response to you all,4
for starters i procrastinate too much i manage to do okay but i know i waste time recently my tik tok has been infested with investment bankers and even scammer type video of people in their s making k per year i know the fallacy that social media is fake but it is making me spiral a little i go to a t law school which is decent and i have decent grades even an interview soon i just feel i wasted so much time and energy and should have aimed to be making that already the legal internships im applying for as full time jobs dont make that kinda money but still money im comfortable with but now im thinking i need to aim for that for the sake of my struggling parents and my current gf who comes from wealth and doesnt currently work but loves luxury,4
for context im in high school my anxiety has been super bad lately and its been causing me to miss school a lot my mom convinced me to go today and it was horrible my science teacher is a great teacher but he can be pretty harsh sometimes telling us our year is the worst our generation is the worst smirking when we do badly on quizzes despite all that stuff i really do respect him as a teacher and hes good at the material i just needed someone to vent to about him so i went to my counselor who i loved she listened and offered insight but then i had to leave at the end of the day my science teacher pulls me aside and tells me that my counselor told him everything he said she told him that i said stuff that he doesnt remember saying its definitely possible he doesnt remember but it did happen and that i was holding on to stuff from the past which wasnt true as he says similar stuff pretty much daily the worst part is my counselor completely misunderstood one of my rants she told him i was upset that he wasnt immediately able to help with something and that i had to wait that wasnt at all true and he said that he thought i would have understood so i explained she misunderstood and he seemed to believe me i just think he believes i asked her to go to him for me so hes mad i didnt directly speak with him he was really respectful one on one which i forget he is sometimes because of how he treats our class as a whole i just feel really bad i dont always agree with him but i never wanted to hurt anyones feelings i was just going to someone i thought i could trust to talk things out im not even really mad at my science teacher im just frustrated that my counselor went behind my back like that i feel horrible though i cried for hours and i dont ever want to go back to school again i feel like such an awful person what should i do and how do i stop replaying everything in my mind,4

i was at the dentist to go get a cavity filled i was somewhat nervous at first but nothing intense it wasnt until they gave me laughing gas i started getting derealization and started feeling weird and told them to stop and take it off after they removed it they continued and put this rubber thing in my mouth then i started to freak out because i wasnt able to breath through my mouth because of it and when i was breathing out through my nose it started slowing or stopping a bit because it was making my throat stop a little then it made me gag and they had to stop the procedure it was embarrassing but at the same time i was disappointed i wasnt able to control myself usually i breathe in and out through my mouth but it felt different and weird to only be able to breathe through nose im doing the procedure again in months i need help to calm myself down,4
i am giving lithium orotate a go for my anxiety first time trying it will report back over the coming days if it helps whats others feedbacks,4
does anyone else feel an overwhelming amount of guilt when feeling angry at other people i think it may partially be rooted in my abandonment issues but recently my boyfriend had been kinda dickish but i never brought anything up cuz i kept convincing myself that it was my fault and that its not a big deal and im being too dramatic i brought it up finally at my tipping point and he said something that really hurt my feelings also dickish and i asked if i could have some space before we talked again at the beginning it was fine but now im starting to feel it again im scared im being too needy for him and that when i tell him i can talk hes gonna tell me he realized he doesnt like me so much anymore and we should breakup rationally i doubt this is gonna happen but i cant help but thinking its my fault i feel so guilty,4
so basically ive suffered anxiety for a few years now but more recently in the past couple months i feel its taken over my life with intense physical symptoms and constant brain fog as well its gotten to the point where its hard to live my doctor prescribed me lorazepam as a way to help get through this stage about days ago and ill be the first to say its done wonders for me and when i take it i feel way better and it makes life bearable my only issue is ik how addictive benzos are so i dont wanna take it everyday but on days i dont take it i feel the usual physical symptoms panic attacks and feeling like shit all day i want to possibly meet with a psychiatrist to find a more long term and safer solution but its hard because my doctors booked out for weeks does anyone know a way to speed up this process and also recommendations for what i should being in my current situation i rlly dont wanna get addicted to benzos and idk how long that takes but i dont wanna risk it im on a small dosage of mg a day,4

i have a pretty nasty sinus infection causing fluid in my ear and its causing vertigo i have pretty bad anxiety panic attacks and ocd they prescribed me amoxicillin and im terrified to take it because of the potential psychological effects can anyone that have had them weigh in and tell me theyre not that bad i dont know i want to feel better but i cant handle more anxiety than what i already deal with unmedicated just hoping for some guidance here,4
over the last weeks my m anxiety had gotten worse to the point of finding it difficult to sleep no appetite tight chest cant focus on work and upset stomach my doctor proscribed me some very low dose xanax for days and also some other anxiety meds that take around weeks to start working im hesitant to take any of it though i dont want to feel dependent on meds and then when i stop taking them the anxiety comes back my long term girlfriend and i broke up earlier in but we would sometimes keep in touch and see each occasionally we went to college together but didnt date in college so alot of her friends are my friends also she moved hrs away for a job before we broke up and that was part of why we broke up along with other things it was easy being with her from the friends aspect but deep down inside there were some things that really bothered me about our relationship we always tried to make it work but it just didnt she ended things with me but we are on good terms she recently told me that she is seeing someone and ever since then it has bothered the hell out of me and have had all this anxiety since its making me think did i make the right decision in pretty much agreeing to break up to the point we spoke on the phone and she said sorry but its over between us i have gotten anxiety bouts before but its always about job deadlines or things that once over the anxiety goes away this is different i know my relationship with her in a romantic way is over and the severity of this anxiety is much worse than anything i have felt before should i consider going to therapy or will just pass in due time thought,4
i feel so embarassed about it,4
ive been isolating myself and unintentionally staying sick ulcers and other stomach problems bc its the only way the self hatred and obsessive thoughts that eat up my mind subside and also i forget easily since feeling this weak this situation has been overextending to the point where idk how bad it is im very swollen and dont digest properly i have palpitations every day and a very slow heart rate i just feel very alone and i know its not worth it to keep going like this but i have no assistance and no one really i know this burden shouldnt be carried by a friend but i wish i were able to give and at least have relationship that works my family is very strange and manipulative it wasnt until now that ive been realizing a bunch of shit about them still i havent done anything for myself or protected my space i dont know how to deal with this,4

for over a month ive started getting new and uncomfortable symptoms it started with fatigueweakness morning heart palpitations waking me up and armslegs feeling some type of nervous energy as of days ago the fatigue is pretty much gone i dont seem to have the heart palpitations as much or at all i was having night sweats often the first few weeks too thats stopped also but im left with this head pressure or clamy feeling in my head all day in the morning i feel the sides of my head in the temple region throbbing and some times i can end up happening during the evening too my head just feels full during the day and i seem to feel disoriented too and just sensitive to so much i dont even know how to explain it all ive been avoiding the gym which i was loving before these new odd symptoms showed up occasionally ill get some relief in my head and when i did i went to workout and everything was fine but thats only happened twice in this past days,4
so my therapist gave me an idea and a bit of a tip she told me when she was going through her anxiety and health anxiety she used to have pains and obsess over them like i do well she told me she started working out so whenever her body was sore she tricked her brain into thinking it was from working out and it kinda was so it helped her well today my heart always just goes insane even laying in bed i jumped up and started dancing as soon as i felt my heart go weird i mean i figured id give it something to go wild about in theory should work right it was funny non the less,4
i just started working at a new place a few days ago people there super nice and its a good environment but my previous work place the first place i worked at so this is my second job was a horrible very toxic and id go home crying every time i can go over a whole list of things that happened there i already had a lot of anxiety but now even more then before i loved it when i had no job i never had to worry about putting on a mask for customers and coworkers or the responsibilities that come with a job i hate the long hours because i can feel myself slowly breaking down inside and when i get back home my anxiety goes through the roof for when i gotta work next even if i got days off im so so so freaking worried that theyll call me to come in when im not mentally prepared i got to have time to psych myself up for work im deep into customer service too so all customers scare me i just idk what to do im an adult living with my parents and they pay for a lot of my stuff and i dont want them to have to do that anymore but i hate feeling on edge and heaps of anxiety all the time i dont know what to do really needing advice or someone to chat to,4
how to get rid of dizziness when out of the house it feels really weird and i get afraid that ill pass out,4
due to mental health ive been slightly struggling with uni studies lately part of why im mentally not doing well is because ive grown up with a rather abusive father and one of the things that hes really forced on me has been to do well in studies like thats just something thats been going on since i started school so this brings me to how extremely anxious i get while studying which usually is at home it can take a while or it can take a few minutes but majority of the times i get so extremely anxious or just straight up have a panic attack in the middle of it the part that causes this isnt that if i dont study well enough and pass this or that exam ill struggle even more with uni but if i dont study well enough and pass this or that exam ill en up in trouble by my dad ultimately i know its always gonna be study for your own sake not anyone elses but after growing up with a father thats so abusive in so many ways its hard to not make that association and just break out until i cant even focus on studying so my question is making that association or not does anyone have any advice on how i at the very least can calm down or put myself at ease when this happens while studying,4
ill add a little background first im a year old male and have never had any diagnosed conditions or health problems in general i have always been extremely shy social health anxiety low confidence never had a girlfriend no friends since i moved to a different part of the country when i was about over time i think i have been able to numb it down creating explanations and reasonings in my mind and used video games as an escape for the last years or so my life have been ampxb wake up and eat breakfast go to work come home and shower make and eat dinner some kind of workout sit at computer sleep and repeat every other weekend i visit my mom who i spend quality time with and help out since she has a condition that keeps her from doing many things herself ampxb but a week ago i was hit like a truck with massive depression and anxiety realizing what my life have been these last years i feel like i have wasted so much time especially on the weekends where i was at home doing nothing instead of going to my mom or just doing anything productive i got thoughts about existential dread death and what our purpose really is i got crushing anxiety about my mom dying and me not spending enough time with her and also because she is the only person in the world that truly knows me understands me and that i can be myself with ampxb i feel like an alcoholic over years who just suddenly stopped drinking from one day to the next now the video games do nothing for me i cant escape and im lost for purpose my appetite is very unstable and my mind is racing especially when i try to sleep which has led to sleepless nights with my heart racing in panic and having constant disaster thoughts that i cant stop i keep thinking am i sick am i going insane do i have a brain tumor and many more thoughts of that kind i also get this weird feeling somethimes of being disconnected or dissociated to the world i become hyperaware of my existence and my actions and thoughts and it makes everything feel weird in this state i feel like im acting like myself when im with others like im something unexplainable controlling this physical body or seeing the world from a rd person view has anyone else experienced this or gone though something similar ampxb i have started on antidepressant and anxiety medicine and started seeing a psycologist but just wanted to share in hopes of getting some feedback or tools to combat these things,4
quick intro years a go i had an incident in the shower that mimicked a stroke i came out of it unharmed but it messed me up psychologically ever since then my body takes any feeling it gets and goes into panic mode now i hate driving i hate taking a shower i hate exercising you name it if i makes me hot i get anxious at onc point i was so anxious showering i had to sit down and hold on for dear life the entire time i was in there now im about over it and form my experience the only way over it is to go through it and what i mean by that is you need to face this demon head on i know its the last thing you want to hear but trust me if you never face it you will be running forever however it will take time for your brain to rewrite its default path ways so at the moment the default behavior is fear and to curl up and say please dont hurt me so your brain interprets it as a threat and will spiral out of control causing all sorts of symptoms the worst of which being a panic attack now next time you start getting the fear coming on try this instead say to your fear out loud just kill me then bring it on lets see what you can do and taunt your fear and let what ever you think is going to happen happen by wanting the what ever it is you are afraid of to happen will make the fear vanish another thing to think if you were to say have a heart attack it would just happen whether you worried or not worrying isnt going to some how miraculously save you at my lowest the turning point for me was when i just thought id rather be dead than to feel like this anymore and from then on i basically laid down my life to my fear and said just kill me kill me now or shut the fuck up i needed to hit rock bottom so i could rebuild my brain the right way and for a few weeks i just kept saying kill me now or shut up over and over until my brain started using the new default behavior it can take months to retrain your brain and then add years on that to fully forget but this is what is working for me tldr taunt your fear egg it on call it out ask it to do its worst even if it kills you let it flow through you and out the other side i bet nothing bad happens tldr if you were going to die it would just happen whether you worried or not worry isnt going to some how miraculously save you,4
im years old and i suffer from cardiopobia i ate more sugar today than ive eaten in over two months and my heart is racing super fast i cant breathe and my hands aretingling and burning so much its freaking me the hell out i know im young but it just freaks me out sometimes i would greatly appreciate some reassurance,4
im a type diabetic and in my teenage years it was a rough time where i fainted multiple times because of low blood sugar some of them was so bad where i ended in a diabetes coma and other my family was pretty sure that i wouldnt make it i could get up in the morning and be completely dizzy not knowing what was going around i would look at my watch and not understand what time it was i got mri scanned and everything was fine while being young and dumb i didnt really care and i thought i was immortal living life with kmp even though my body was screaming after a break a few years later in i caught covid a pretty bad one and i have got asthma afterwards while being sick with covid i realized that i wasnt immortal at all i realized how vulnerable our body really is the thoughts started to getting into me from the times i fainted and my covid process i have become afraid of everything and connects it with heart problems cancer brain tumor ect my body cant be doing anything before im convinced that im getting the worst news soon im always prepared to say i knew it its driving me insane the last few months it have been brain tumor that is making me going dumb because of a tension headache even though its probably just work related im a teacher and because i sit and work in different positions that isnt great for either my neck or back i dont recognize my self as said before i have become distend from my friends i never seen them or talk with them anymore always finding excuses to not get out of the house i stopped playing soccer guess why because im thinking i will be getting a cardiac arrest if i do so it have been hard the last years causing stress depression and healthy anxiety not diagnosed yet only with stress i know i need help but how do i get it im not used to getting help i have solved my own problems ever since i was a kid do i just call the doctor and say hey i think i have a depression and bad health anxiety or what do i even say this really sucks,4

ive struggled with anxiety for years but the way its come back recently has me really worried for my wellbeing i havent been able to eat properly in a couple weeks ill feel hungry but im so anxious that i feel like gagging whenever i try to eat im struggling immensely to complete university assignments i keep handing in things late and poorly done because i just feel like i cant focus no matter what i do i dont know how to bounce back it feels like my only reprieve is when i sleep or get high so ive been doing a lot of that but i know its just delaying my inevitable anxiety when it wears off im really in need of help and i dont know what to do,4
so i have been suffering from awful derealizationdepersonalisation anxiety ocd and panic attacks for a couple of years now but its always come and gone ever since last year after going through a traumatic event its shifted my entire life to now only being able to focus on my anxiety there are days that i get better and days where i have bad flair ups i actively go to therapy and have recently started seeing a psychiatrist and nutritionist to see if i could figure out how to solve all these issues especially the derealization as it causes me to feel so out of it and almost high as it has been prevalent for the last year especially now i have been prescribed zoloft before but i had the absolute worst adverse reaction to it and has made me terrified to start any ssris recently my psychiatrist had prescribed me prozac but my therapist and nutritionist advise me against it as they do not think that my case is that severe where i am currently having an issue with is the fact that my biggest fearocd trigger is not feeling normal such as the fear of weed and i typically stay away from alcohol as i do not like how i feel when i drink i am so scared to start meds or even vitamins that contain magnesium because i am so afraid of the high feeling or derealization feeling but now dont know where to go from here if anyone has advice on how to get over this substance ocd i would greatly appreciate it,4

im f not sure how to write this ive never put down my memories to paper let alone tell anyone a family member would do certain things between from what little i can remember the ages of these things made me feel uncomfortable and i asked multiple times for it to stop to no avail i want to protect their identity so calling them x x never let me lock the bathroom door when i shower x walks right in and has conversations with me even though the shower doors are seethrough this still happens now at yo i used to lock the door when i was younger but x would use a coin to open the door and would leave it wide open so i just stoped locking the door and forget to every time now x have always sneaked up the stairs and burst into my room on purpose dispute multiple times asking x to knock if im just out a shower and wearing a towel ill always ask x to leave but x scoffs as if i should be less embarrassed and im weak for being embarrassed about being naked when i was younger if i would touch myself x would take enjoyment from bursting into my room and surprising me and made me feel dirty and mentally fucked up for doing so x would also watch through a crack in the door caught them sometimes before bursting in x would ask to see my breasts and say it was to compare mine to theirs and any time i said i didnt want to i was made to feel silly for being embarrassed like it was no big deal x used to ask me to shower with them well over the age i needed anyone to wash my hair still asking me at x would again scoff if i said no and plead for me to join them as if i was not wanting quality time with them x flashes me still does and leaves the door to the bathroom wide open when they shower and sometimes calls me over to chat with them on purpose as if they want to see my reaction to seeing them naked x would insist on checking me down there when i was younger and would put cream on me saying there was a rash but i never saw one i remember getting older and being adamant that i could do it myself but x got furious with me x gets into my bed without asking when im in bed or when im not and asks me to cuddle them in their bed and gets angry when i say no the next two are hard for me to typei dont feel ready but this platform has been really supportive so far so here goes for content x definitely physically abused me and still emotionally abuses me and i think they are narcissistic growing up and even sometimes now i go into a childlike mind and put on a higher pitched child like voice this cringes me so much so please dont say anything nasty about this once when i was around i was hugging x in their bed and was in this childlike state they played into it and said aww my baby do you want to suck milk and i for some disgusting reason that bothers me to this day i nodded and x got their breasts out and i i cant type the rest but i dont think i need to again difficult to put down to writing this one i dont know if its in my head when i was younger x would ask me to sit on their lap i would feel or think i did them pushing up their private part on my body i would feel uncomfortable and would sit in a different position but it would keep happening and i learnt to ignore it sorry for the left hoy post but because this is not obvious or classic case of sexual abuse i think im just unsure if it was i know this person would take it very badly if they knew i was thinking this and i feel like im betraying that persons honour or something context been depressed since and after experiencing panic attacks for the first time at i finally told a doctor and im on a waiting list to get help for pdsd unsure if thats what i have and i dont know if its worth mentioning this if its stupid or a lie or if i am even able to i also struggle to enjoy sex unless its bdsm im not sure if thats related but i just feel dirty if i am wanting it,4

so just gonna start off i dont have any kind of diagnosis but i feel like recently for a few month i just feel my hearts very fast faster than normal and before i sleep i feel like my whole body is shaking bcs my heart is beating so fast and it also happens when im stressed or im in school or it just happens also that sometimes i just feel unreal kinda feels like im floating i wonder if this is like anxiety symptoms maybe i should get this checked out,4
so my md tells me that i should cut out sugar and that the body can run without it i suffer from extreme anxiety and when i try cutting out sugar i get weak and my stomach is turning inside out my body aches from craving sugar i tried cutting out times the longest was days i just continuously got worse at the end i was just lying in bed in horrid pain it feels like my body needs that extra sugar in order to cope with the draining anxiety also my blood sugar levels stay stable with or without sugar,4
i feel like its like those cartoons where you plug one hole in a leaky boat and another leak forms and so on some months its tingling sometime aching then cramping then stomach stuff cold then sweaty just when i get one to stop another pops up or a different combination and these things rarely happen while im busy or my mind is calm happy and occupied anyone have these shifting symptoms,4

this may be a very stupid question but can any ladies feel confusion on whether theyre experiencing chest pain or boob pain my boobs arent too big nor too small but this tension i feel is more towards the top of my chest yet its also apart of my boobscan anybody help me differentiate or share similar experiences,4
i have been blessed with the ability to freak myself right the famp out whenever i think about a host of different topics anxiety now most of these topics ive been able to find categories for and address in that way by learning about those things bettering my understanding of them and really evaluating exactly what it is that im afraid of for example i am a hypochondriac i have lived with health anxiety for as long as i can remember but its very easy to find out what health anxiety is you can easily find other peoples experiences common coping mechanisms potential causes for this anxiety etc this is the case with almost anything i find myself consistently anxious about now one of the darkest corners in my mind that i try to stay out of as much as possible is one that i cant get a lot of information on and because of this i dont know how to move forward in addressing this this anxiety fear is triggered by thoughts of existence reality the thought of consciousness trying to wrap my mind around what it is that im experiencing just by being alive in the first place a good example thought of this would be this whether you are reading this on a computer or phone or tablet stop and take a second to think about what is between your eyes reading this and the screen infront of you now i dont mean the air pollen dust particles etc that occupies that space but the fing space itself how why is that there what is that occupying how did it get there i experience symptoms of derealization depersonalization disorder that ive observed are closely related to my thoughts like this hell i believed when i was until i was falling into psychosis due to my relentless obsessing over the unanswerable its not even one specific mindf that does this to me its the combination of all of them that represent what we call reality or existence that i cant tune out and the more i try to research these things in my life the more questions that are left unanswered i can barely hold conversations with people because of how often i just go blank returning to being consumed with mulling these things over in the middle of conversations i feel like most people are able to just curb these thoughts as unimportant or just set them aside because theres no way to answer things like that at the moment boy do i wish i could do just that thoughts like this are on my mind i mean i dream about inexplicable things that could never be answered and i wake up open my eyes and wonder what is this plane of existence that im experiencing how do i retain my persona my memories my trains of thought all of my experiences after so many years how do i face any interaction any experience any leaf that lands infront of me on a walk without my mind jumping to the probability of these things happening and then wondering how im even able to question that in the first place this has not been a midlife crisis rather it has been a wholelife drain i have never been afraid of the wheeler next to me on the freeway yet i have always been afraid of the inevitable heat death of the universe why am i like this,4
hi guys ive experienced anxiety for a long time now f id say at least years symptoms have always been tight chest heart going a million miles an hour the occasional panic attack ive always managed it quite well have a decent job and can interact with people fairly well ive never let it stop me doing anything as then id feel like it has beat me as of weeks ago it was literally one day fine and the next not fine i got on the train to go to work and felt like i was going to throw up my mouth was watering and heart felt like it was in my throat at first i thought it was food poisoning and something was physically amiss even though i havent thrown up and logic would indicate im not going to it feels like i genuinely am on the verge everytime i am in a moving vehicle i thought it would pass but its now just part of my everyday life and im finding it debilitating im scared ill lose my job because of it which is feeding into the anxiety even more the only way i can get through a train journey or any moving vehicle for that matter is by closing my eyes and putting on bob marley through my headphones its quite comedic but it genuinely is the only way i can slightly manage it ive never enjoyed the commute and have done it for ages but now its became a thing i have to have a plastic bag with me at all times as the urge to throw up is so real has anyone else experienced a sudden and drastic change in anxiety symptoms how do you manage them im scared ill be this way forever,4
okay so theres a lot for me to go through here and i have to apologise as it is hard for me to explain things as its hard for me to even understand whats going on in my brain ive been with my partner now coming up to years in may wonderful healthy relationship where there are no issues whatsoever ill preface this by saying i have struggled with mental health on and off throughout my life mainly being anxiety so i have been on fluoxetine anti depressants for the last years this has been great for me and has helped me to regulate my emotions and feelings quite well and to what i believe has helped my relationship with my partner to flourish and i have felt genuinely happy anyway cutting to now since the very very start of the year just after new years obviously i noticed a lot of anxiety although it may of been creeping in a few weeks before it was as though now i felt it full blast and my inner voice kept telling me that my boyfriend was interested in someone else and i was then getting strong feelings of them cheating although there was no indication of this i think on new years eve i had noticed my boyfriend getting on well with his mates and watching one of his friends who is a girl sing hes a musician and i know the following sounds daft believe me so the next day i kept getting intrusive thoughts of that moment and feeling very sensitive around it as im quite insecure and never sing and i know my boyfriend would love it if i came out my shell more in that way although hes always telling me how perfect i am it kept going through my mind that he should be with someone like that fast forward a few days im still feeling very on edge and feel incredibly anxious when my boyfriend isnt really showing me that much affection or is in his room for long periods of time i get very panicky and cant seem to calm myself until i go upstairs to see what hes up to if hes just sat there on his phone with his door shut i assume that hes not wanting to be with me even though i think having our own space is healthy and have never had an issue with it before after seeing him just sat there ill get incredibly upset and more anxious and feel very emotional may even start crying and its difficult to stop i suddenly view my boyfriend very differently ill also mention now that i was never like this at any other point of our relationship i just started feeling this intense anxiety since new years also ill mention that im a very sensitive person and feel as though i pick up on other peoples emotions very easily and that i do that a lot with my boyfriend if he is feeling down about himself etc i also feel these emotions as the days went on i stopped getting these anxious feelings when he wasnt always around but still felt bad anxiety and feeling depression creeping in as the days progressed i noticed myself becoming more sensitive to things and even hyperaware think thats the word which would cause more anxiety for me my boyfriend may say something and i would take it in a negative way and feel offended by it and it would cause a lot of hurt and then anxiety is even worse i would have a lot of moments of just emotional outbursts of crying and finding it difficult to stop just feeling very overwhelmed and so uncomfortable in how im feeling even gagging from what felt like stress and not being able to eat im feeling this pretty much everyday the past month and a bit ive been having internal thoughts such as i dont love you and other horrible things directed at my boyfriend which cause me so much anxiety and even more stress as i try to convince myself they are just thoughts and not real having suddenly no feelings towards him getting irritated at little things but still feeling intensely sad over the thought of him with someone else this person is perfect in my eyes and i love all the things about them that are considered imperfections where have my feelings gone its been over a month and im scared they wont return because i know this relationship when im not feeling this way is so good for me and has been the best thing for my life ill quickly mention that im now and had a relationship when i was that brought a lot of the very same feelings up but this happened very early on in the relationship a month or so with much breaking up and getting back together due to my anxiety and depression im sorry for the essay but its really hard to fit everything in but this is just the summary of it please can i get real responses with this i really want to make this relationship work and stop this anxiety and emotional stress and be able to feel these feelings again for my partner id hate to think that its over now,4
i have a low selfesteem i dont have confidence and i stutter a lot i cant recite during class because i got a hard time explaining what i want to say i feel worthless and devastated to the point i lost interest in my life i feel pathetic and i know im not worth it im not smart since i always get a low grade but still manage to pass i feel so small despite the fact that i struggle a lot i have a social anxiety and depression but you know i try to change myself i try to be a person who i want to be yet i cant change myself because no one got my back no one believe in me and support me its hard to fight alone in this lonely and painfull battle within myself then now i realize that i live my life pleasing the other people i feel sorry for myself and life i realize the people will never acknowledge or believe in me because in the first place they see me as a trash and stupid i want to show to the people who laugh at me who never believe in me and to the people who never support me that i can achieve something in my life,4
i have been feeling super anxious and insecure recently about the fact that my partner acknowledges that he has celebrity crushes or finds other women in our life good looking i dont mean hes asking these people out or hes making moves i just mean on a surface level my partner mentions often enough that he thinks a girl is good looking or that he finds this celebrity attractive it really makes me anxious and insecure so i have a hard time hearing this i know he doesnt mean anything by it but its really upsetting me and making me feel so worried all the time that he is going to leave me is it normal for guys to do this is it normal for people to feel attraction to other people while theyre in relationships i certainly think other men are attractive i wont lie but i definitely do not think about making a move on them or even flirting i know the same is true for my partner im just having a hard time coping,4
i had one before and it absolutely changed my life i developed health anxiety and so much more i just want to know if this happened to anyone else and if it did what happened that day and after,4
hey guys the last days after i got officially diagnosed with anxiety disorder i went without any symptoms i guess finaly having a name for my problems calmed me down but two hours ago when i came back from a walk my left back side under the rib started to hurt it not a stinging pain or something that i cant manage but it feels a little bit like back pain and is slightly pulsating i think it also radiates a little bit to the right side and i am feeling a bit dizzyout of myself right now i went to pee and it came out like normal without any pain so it shouldnt be my kidneys right this dizziness scares me so much though has anyone ever experienced something like this or maybe i should really call an ambulance i dont know what to do i am so worried,4
why do i feel like the outsider when my families all together i always assume im not included in anything actively happening even though im being invited to things and events i exclude myself from them for this reason any help or insight would be great,4

i have been struggling with worse anxiety for the past year and recently my anxiety does not let me believe that my boyfriend loves me he gives me reassurance everytime i ask but for some reason it is never enough for instance when he says why he does my thoughts will find complaints with his reasons why i havent talked to him about this because this is technically not a his issue and i hate burdening others with my anxiety he has reassured me everyday and i dont want to ask for more i feel like this is something i need to figure out on my own ive had bad experiences with boys in general so i often time believe that they will say whatever is convenient to them so i cannot shake this feeling and i do not know what to do ive been talking to a therapist but she has not been giving me effective solutions she listens and validates but i need calming techniques how do i shake this feeling what should i do,4
m ive been busy with life in a good way for the past months going to the gym times a week and eating healthy starting to like myself again however out of nowhere its back the feeling that im not doing things i should be doing feeling like the future isnt as bright as i hoped and i dont know what to do ive never spoken to anyone about my anxiety except my friend who is studying in a different country now i dont know who i can speak to because in my head my problems seem like theyre not big enough for me to talk about but yet they have a weird weight on my chest that makes it harder to breath,4
i am eating some good i havent eaten for hours i had a headache ive gotten like hours sleep the past couple of nights i walked out in the cold for a minute and turned the lights on i had a bad dream that made me feel like i was going crazy,4
im trying to figure out and address an issue ive had my entire life or at least as long as i can remember as i try to seek out treatment and help im not sure if anyone here can relate i will obsess and fixate on completely mundane things for example if i overhear someone taking about a movie but i dont know what the movie is i may fixate on who did they say the lead was an australian named ben what was the movie what was the movie and my heart will start racing and my breathing will get shallow and ill need to get up and walk around another example might be for me to see a photo of myself reading and ill obsess wanting to figure out what the title of the book is that im reading i might also obsess wondering what a logo on a shirt is who was that guy that i helped with a flat tire that seemed so familiar etc you know how sometimes people will hear a song and not know what it is and theyll say what is that song its going to drive me nuts for me it feels like that going to drive me nuts thing is for real these attacks might also occur in certain circumstances of guilt or selfloathing does this sound at all relatable does it have a name,4

so to start off i dont have many friends and i dont participate in many discords so i admit im a little out of practice here but recently my three cousins decided we should all be part of a group chat and rekindle the bond we had as kids i was all for it theyre family and i love em but just existing in this group chat is giving me some major anxieties it also doesnt help that i have absolutely nothing in common with any of them all they talk about is work their sos and gossip they said we would be sending each other memes but every meme theyve sent so far have been the most unfunny monotonous tiktok reaction videos ive ever seen i dont even know how to respond to them so so far i just havent now after about days the group chat is silent and i feel like theyve silently moved on i just know its going back to the usual where i only ever talk to them at family gatherings which is another awkward thing im going to stress about i really am at a loss of how to handle myself and i fear that if i eventually get into a group chat of other friend groups itll go the same way ive tried joining discords before of varying sizes in the past but nowadays everyone types so fast and gets their thoughts out in seconds i feel like by the time my brain is even able to process what was said and think of a response theyve already changed topics has anyone else here had to deal with this kind of thing before,4

hi everyone i noticed my anxiety over the past couple months has gotten worse i used to maintain decently w cbd here and there but i find that im getting frustrated or my fight or flight is seriously kicking in for context just shopping in a store the other day im reaching for a can of food and my bf is near me suddenly a middle aged man w a cart barrels through towards me and an employee is inches from me reaching for items directly below me i suddenly moved so i wouldnt be touched or run over by this guy w the cart no pardon me excuse me nothing this morning i come to do my laundry at my local laundromat i usually chat w a little old lady here but she usually gets in my personal space to clean literally crumbs from the floor i am putting laundry in and im suddenly butttobutt with the laundry attendant a woman comes in w a body bag sized laundry bag and almost hits me w it and i try to back up and the laundry woman is directly behind me inches behind me i finished loading the laundry and went to my car for a deep breath i called my bf to vent and he understands mostly how i feel i also am starting to feel like an emotional burden to him idk how to cope anymore i feel like im on edge all the time any tips would be amazing i dont have health insurance so i cant be seen by a doctor anytime soon thanks for listening,4
my bf is going out with some friends tonight and i was too scared to ask if i could come along normally i would but recently he said he wanted some space so it doesnt feel right asking him if i can tag along places anymore hell always say yes just to be nice then my friends call asking if we want to hang out with them and im like bf is already going out at this point i freak out urgent social interaction and i would have to ask bf for a ride no i dont want to bother him i feel stupid that i wanted to go out so bad but when i was offered another chance to go out i declined because i was too scared of everything i was too scared to ask to go with him i was to scared to ask for a ride i was too scared to go to an unplanned social event tomorrow i have a planned social event and now i feel so insecure it just feels like a cycle why cant i just do these things edit next day and i found out he got a ride for once since hes always dd so i couldnt have asked for a ride anyway if i had asked for a ride i think it would have been worse because he would have felt pressured to drive me which again would not be great since he asked for space a while back i was feeling like the call was a sign to go out and i didnt so i was feeling down on myself for choosing to miss out but now that i know i probably could not have gotten a ride anyway somehow i feel better lmao weird how that works isnt it,4

hey all for context im f and in week of l so have just started law school however these past three years but specifically last year was so hard on me on top of enormous pressure and performing at a ridiculous standard in high school to get into law my grandpa who had been battling with a brain tumour died days before my first exam these exams were the ones that dictated whether or not id get into university for some background my grandpa was like my father to me when i was younger especially my dad wasnt home often as he was constantly working as a lawyer and would get home really late so i wouldnt see him as a result my grandparents looked after me and i spent countless hours with them and still see my grandma every week as you can imagine his death was possibly the most devastating thing for me seeing someone so articulate and intelligent being unable to move nor speak to you was so hard but i had to push it all aside and after burying him in the ground i went into school no literally minutes after the burial i had to go to school for final exam prep anyways this was in november of i got through exams and for the first time in what felt like forever i felt happy at christmas my mind was clear i was surrounded by family and didnt have any responsibilities i even managed to stop anti depressants for my anxiety which had been bad from but especially ramped up in the period of his deaths to the point where i got through my days with whiskey and beta blockers so i had a brief intermission of calm i was happy for about weeks till about february this year until it all came rushing back anxiety panic attacks derealization just like that put back on mg of lexapro which ive been on for just under weeks the trigger possibly university being back in an educational context with such high stakes and workload such as law may have caused this relapse but i decided id push through and have one to uni these past four weeks with the help of beta blockers its been probably one of the most difficult weeks since my grandpa died exhaustion unable to leave the house without terrible anxiety and just loss of ability to enjoy anything ive spoke to my therapist and he thinks i need a break from study and need some time to actually relax and process to allow my body o heal besides the mental strain ive been under theres also been physical and health issues ive been dealing with being hyperthyroidism and as of a week ago iron deficiency seems like my body wants me to stop but i dont want to studying gives me a sense of purpose of validation i guess all i ask for is for some advice please this is a big decision for me and i really just want someone to talk to and hear me thank you in advance,4
i had a complete breakdown in december nearly a month to the day after writing my mom out of my life i am mid s and my therapist said i have two ptsd triggers from childhood trauma with my mother being the largest chunk the er trip in december involved barking help but feeling like i wasnt the one saying it and randomly losing consciousness due to hyperventilating and intense heart palpitations the heart palpitations and hyperventilating happened about years ago as well and i remember doing similar when i was a young kid i had another panic attack last week and my anxiety has been up and down hydroxyzine for panic instances and prozac to keep me level my mind instantly goes to the worst places when my anxiety is high its a stroke a heart attack a tumor an uncurableunknown disease thanks to therapy im no longer depersonalizingderealizing but this just means that staying in the moment involves powering through intense heart palpitations fear and coldhot feelings the medication brought back a handful of dreams for the first time in more than a decade or two but only for a week but now i have had a handful of simple auditory hallucinations such as a drum beat a beeping sound or the sound of water pouring all of which are coming from in my head has anyone had a similar mental breakdown after removing someone like a parent work has been a stressor too but my mom was the trigger and work was the icing for months before this i was frequently tired and not hungry at all and always stressed at work and had a short temper i just want to feel normal right now things are generally ok but when that spiraling anxiety occurs its really hard to break free and feel like im staying sane,4

long term klonopin i am a yo male with fairly bad anxiety have tried every ssri in the book none of them work and give me horrible side effects my anxiety is as follows completely random attacks feel like im dying i went to the er many times i cant process thoughts in my head pretty much hard time holding conversation i will sometimes have attacks with stressful situations at work but i have an important job so i dont let those attacks stop home from doing my job even tho it can be miserable i have tried many different ssri hydroxzyine which works sometimes the only thing that has worked is xanax im prescribed mg but i typically break it up and take as needed the only thing i havent tried is a beta blocker which i will try next xanax allows me to have a perfectly clear head i dont feel like a retard and trip over my words and feel disassociated when i am on it i dont feel sedated or tired i just feel normal it curbs and prevents panic attacks for usually hours i have been taking it more than i should recently every day to every other day i do notice some rebound anxiety on the days off but nothing too crazy if a beta blocker doesnt work i will try clonazapam i really dont care about dementia later in life so my question is if these drugs increase my quality of life dramatically should i really avoid them just because of withdrawls yes i know their hell but you dont go through them if you are on em for long term with no intention of getting off sorry for the essay pls share input advice and experience thanks,4

i f have been dating my boyfriend m for two years now we havent really had any problems until my anxiety started worsening about months ago ive had anxiety and depression since middle school and was officially diagnosed with adhd in january my anxiety and depression have been at a low for a few years now which i definitely took for granted im on a couple different antidepressants and got them to a good level about months ago my anxiety started worsening for no discernible reason okay great im working with my therapist on it and talking to my psychiatrist about it but my overall mental health is still going downhill my boyfriend luckily for him has never struggled with mental health and has no idea how to relate to me or support me ive been working really hard to communicate with him about how im feeling and what i need but he really just ignores it for example in january we were out of the country for my work and planned on staying a couple extra nights to make a vacation out of it traveling generally heightens my anxiety especially international travel a lot of little things happened including a couple small actions he made one day that led to an anxiety attack and he basically ignored the fact that it was happening a couple hours after i came down from the attack and i had taken a cold shower and eaten a little bit i talked to him about it a bit i said you can correct me if im wrong but it seems like you dont know how to respond or support me when im having really bad anxiety moments like this he said yeah thats true so i asked if it would be helpful if i told him a couple things that help when im really struggling he agreed so i said a few things like getting me some cold water giving me a hugholding me taking a walk with me if thats an available option things like that he said he could work with that over the past two or so months since then ive had a few anxiety attacks similar to the one i had in january and every time he basically ignores my anxiety ive repeated my request a couple times but it doesnt make any difference there are a lot of other similar issues that have been going on as well over the weekend we had a very short conversation probably minutes max and half of it was silence because neither of us knew what to say none of this is necessarily in order i really dont remember the order because it was really emotionally charged and kind of upsetting i said i wanted to try to make it work i asked him if he wanted to try to make it work and his response was i want you to be happy and i dont want to be taking that from you whether its because im not putting the effort in or unable to support you or something else which didnt actually answer my question i guess it did in a roundabout way though i also asked if he still loved me and he paused for what felt like forever before saying yes ive spent more time crying in the past two weeks than i have my entire life before this ive been thinking about our relationship a lot over the past couple months hes not a very talkative person in general if theres an issue he ignores it completely or makes passive remarks and doesnt actually bring it up i feel like not only am i the only one that tries to open communication lines but that im not getting my needs met also ive talked to my therapist about it a bunch and i think ive pretty much made my decision im going to break up with him and work on my mental health it feels terrible sitting on this knowing the relationship is coming to an end i have some major events coming up at work this week including a day long audit that im in charge of so im basically trying to balance holding off for as long as possible ie the end of the week and being anxious and miserable about it and having that hard conversation now and being a different kind of upset and not able to focus at work either way im not going to be able to be completely mentally present at work im just trying to figure out what would be best for me and also respectful to my partner im struggling with feeling like im broken and impossible to love because of my anxiety i know thats not actually the case but it sure feels that way anyway thank you for listening all my family lives out of state and i only have a couple friends none of which i really talk about deep stuff like this with i just want a hug i apologize for the long post i just wanted to get it off my chest,4
hi all mnew york this post is about my struggle with health anxiety and the fear that my heart is failing might be a long one but would love to speak to anyone who hasis going through anything similar i have had anxiety for years but have been able to deal with it until recently months ago i had some chest pain which caused a massive panic attack the only way i can explain the sensation is that it felt like someone was grabbing my heart and squeezing a couple of days later i went to my doctor and had all the necessary tests blood work ekg echo etc all results came back fine as expected except for the fact that i have an oddly low pulse most of the time and the chest tightness remained over the next few months my panic attacks became less frequent twice a week and my chest tightness began to disappear i managed this by reminding myself throughout the day of any moment where i was distracted enough to feel normal an hour or two went by and i would be suddenly be reminded that im not dying i feel great it must all be in my head i had also started weekly therapy during this time but i didnt find it particularly helpful my therapist mostly talked for an hour and guided me through breathing exercises i think what i really wanted was to find the route of the problem more recently my panic attacks have been worse and more frequent i have been feeling heart palpitations a lot or more accurately my heart skipping beats i began checking my pulse and counting the beats fairly often at this point causing more anxiety and more panic attacks now im obsessed with my low pulse and my blood pressure machine almost all results show high blood pressure with a pulse of i have just had a heart monitor on my chest for hours and wont get the results back for another days or so and this is where i am at frequent panic attacks and the constant thought that my high blood pressure and low pulse will either kill me give me a stroke or make me faint anyone else gone through this thanks,4

my dad is a very angry alcoholic and ive dealt with it my whole life ive watched my mother struggle mentally with it too i also still live with my father and cant afford to move out at the time we had an episode tonight and he charged after me and my mom had to get involved i was already having horrible anxiety and this has increased tenfold i feel that my heart will give out i dont want to live the rest of my life like this ive already made so many mistakes and i can barely hold down a job is there anything i can do to deal with this unbearable anxiety i dont blame my anxiety entirely on him but i cant help but feel that its caused some harm in my life,4
some family are over at my house right now i enjoyed the company for a while i came into my room to clean up a little bit and just laid down to rest and then go to sleep i took a deep breath and a thought came to my mind im in my room and i can hear everyone laughing and joking and just having the time of their lives its so hard because i just want to be in my room watching my show and not having to talk or interact it makes me feel like such an outsider i dont know if im making sense i just feel like i was hit with a sudden realization that anxiety is always there no matter how much i work toward healing,4
for a time now i had never had bad dreams sleep was always quiet and if i had a dream it was always positive however lately my dreams has been really bad its always about worst case scenarios where i lose this girl i have been talking to and i feel like im developing my feelings towards is this anxiety of losing her how come i never have these thoughts when im lucid ps sorry for the bad english im not a first hand speaker of english thank you,4
i think my gad is so severe it now has a physiological source where my brain chemistry is messed up my cortisol or serotonin levels throughout the day decide how i feel dae see patterns in their anxiety symptoms like this mornings wake up feeling shaky and short of breath takes min of scrolling on my phone to get the motivation to get up afternoon tension builds up and i feel stiff and uncomfortable for no reason or have an adrenaline dump around this time early evening can be either i feel fine or symptoms start up again and last for a bit late evening right at around pm or so some chemical switch goes off in my body and of my issues vanish it gets easier to breathe my heart slows down and my brain fog lifts start feeling much happier too and its very obvious the constant subconscious anxiety has lifted i have always been a night owl and even before my panic disorder i had weird spurts of energy and motivation in the late evening which made me a productivity machine in the am sleep i can sleep relatively ok but if something startles me and wakes me up i have a full on panic attack i get at least h of sleep daily ampxb i wonder if medication can help fix this any experiences,4
hello i think this is related to my stressanxiety because lately its been kinda worse but i have this weird fullness in my ears i started freaking out a little earlier and then noticed my ears starting to feel like this mostly just one but now its in two and they are sensitive to sound like idk how to explain it its really uncomfortable and its making me freak out even more i dont know what it is or if anyone else is experiencing it if someone else is experiencing it please reply to this because i hope its not just me,4
this is going to sound so stupid lol but basically i am going to centre parcs with my boyfriend soon and he really wants to go on the tropical cyclone water slide i have been on it twice a couple months back at a different centre parcs and i was ok i did panic and stop breathing the first time the second time i only stopped breathing for a second lol anyways im basically asking for advice because i am so worried about this im losing sleep and i literally think about it everyday on the bus a couple days ago my chest felt really heavy and my throat felt all small because i was just thinking about going on the slide its so annoying as i dont want to seem boring and ill be sad if i dont go on it however i am terrified not even that scared of the slide more scared of the panic i hate my brain any advice,4
so yeah me and my girlfriend have great times with each other but i keep getting these thoughts that i need her to say that she loves me constantly or she doesnt feel it anytime we have even the smallest discussion i think she hates me so i need vonstant reassuring of her feelings and i think that might annoy her how do i deal with these thoughts,4

i m started dating my girlfriend f around months ago almost a month ago we became officially boyfriendgirlfriend and since then my anxiety has skyrocketed at the start i used to be pretty confident always trusted her etc but now im struggling she has given me reason not to trust her but im always thinking worst case scenario she is on her phone probably talking to another guy she goes out with her friends probably cheating on me yesterday we were together in bed and i saw she was looking at some photos on her phone and could see on the photo reel some pictures i didnt recognize the background was red and that was everything i could actually see i was without glasses i immediately started thinking that those pictures are probably with a random guy and that she is cheating on me i mean even if they were photos with someone else which i dont even know if they were photos of herscreenshots a random thing etc she can have photos with friends without me thinking this i know this is not healthy and while i havent showed her my anxiety im sure at some point i will mess up and she will probably start distancing herself i mean this reeks controlling behavior right i even had some issues with my bank that i thought she caused not at all this is my second relationship my first was not great but my ex never cheated or anything so im not sure what is causing this could it he that im insecure or just dont want to lose her my gf is awesome and i really enjoy our relationship so far she is attentive shows interest always makes time for us cooks for me etc i feel loved it is worth noting that i almost screw everything up at the beginning as i broke up with her before we were oficial for another girl i realized my mistake shortly after and she accepted me back after apologizing and having a deep conversation with her im constantly thinking that i dont deserver her after that and that if i were her who knows if i would have taken me back could this be part of it tldr i m started dating my gf f over months ago she has given me reason to not trust her but im constantly anxious thinking the worst that she is talking with other people cheating on me etc this makes me fear i will eventually become very controlling how can i address this,4
ever since i was maybe ive had an irrational fear of carbon monoxide poisoning its gotten better now that im older but it used to be so bad to the point where i would refuse to sleep some nights because i was convinced that i would die in my sleep from carbon monoxide poisoning and that i wouldnt be able to hear the alarm going off if there ever was a leak i currently have one co detector in my house a battery operated one and its in my living room i recently read somewhere that co detectors at least the first alert ones which is the kind i have are only effective for about years i unplugged mine and checked the back and saw that the date of manufacture was march nd which was almost exactly years ago although the alarm hasnt given the end of life warning yet i even tested it to see if it was still working and it was although there was no green or red light dont know if that means its not receiving power or what or if thats normal its currently pm so i cant really go out and buy another co detector right now im just scared that there will be a leak or something tonight and that my detector wont go off and ill die in my sleep along with my pets i know its extremely unlikely that there will be a co leak tonight but i cant help but think about it ill probably buy another detector tomorrow if im able to im terrified right now i feel like this is such a stupid thing to be afraid of and im not really sure why ive been afraid of it for so long any reassurance would be very much appreciated i hope ill be able to get some sleep tonight,4
think ive accepted now ive got pretty bad cardiophobia get every manner of symptom missed beats fast hr at rest dizzy sick lightheaded legs feeling heavy sometimes stabbing chest pain had a million heart tests all normal what symptoms do you guys get how did it all start for you and what has actually helped you get out of this hole of being scared of your own heart its insane to even remember what it was like just going about your day and not thinking every slight physical symptom is your heart about to stop beating,4

can you ever really heal general anxiety disorder is it more so you can only manage it over the years but not really heal it or maybe manage over the years and it decreases slowly over time and then eventually heals or could it be healed more in a sudden moment like maybe after a few days the anxiety is just completely gone,4
i am nearly months in having bad anxiety spring break i didnt really do much because my body felt so heavy as if it just wants to drop and rest especially my arms i can be on my phone laying down and it would randomly have the urge of just dropping raise your arm a bit and just drop it thats what i feel it wants to do its never actually dropped or anything just i get a feeling that it wants to as if someone is pulling my limbs down i also notice when im driving my foot just feels weird like heavy and when i turn the wheel too and i feel weak im kinda new to anxiety and i just want to know if anyone else has or had this problem before and how to fix it,4
i have been a sufferer of gad and pure o ocd for years possibly my whole life one interesting aspect of my own anxiety is that i have developed a sort pride in my anxiety in the fact that i think its so bad that no one else could possibly even relate or even be close to mine i have identified and hypothesized that this is really a form or manifestation of narcissism and possibly a coping mechanism throughout my journey of anxiety my brain has tried to deal with the helplessness of anxiety by trying to twist my crippling anxiety into a form of grandiosity delusional which i am hypothesizing is the narcissism aspect,4
i had pretty bad problems with anxiety a couple of years ago but i managed to get better for the last couple of years i worked remotely my job was calm and my colleagues were nice two weeks ago i started a new office job at first felt just drained mentally and physically and i thought that this was just me adjusting to my new lifestyle but now i feel how my anxiety is back being locked in a small room the whole day surrounded by people that i dont know has taken a tow on my mental health and this in only weeks i have the option to work someday of the week remotely but i was hoping to be in the office until i get a grasp of what are my daytoday tasks so do you have any advice on how i can deal with this for at least a couple more weeks until i feel comfortable getting an home office day,4

hello all im new here i recently decided to take a break from a problematic drinking habit and found that i had been self medicating for anxiety more than i realized as it sprang back with a fury i decided to go back on ssris fluoxetine generic prozac specifically i figured it would help me with the depression and anxiety as my brain healed ive been abstinent from alcohol for days now the first few days of fluoxetine were amazing but then mid last week i started feeling really really anxious like unprovoked where are these waves of intense anxiety coming from anxiety ive been on anti depressants in the past so im no stranger to their effects but i dont remember having this negative of a reaction ive been trying every coping mechanism i know i have a very supportive family and am seeing a therapist so ill get through this its just extremely uncomfortable did i mention that im a middle school music teacher its really hard to stand up in front of a room of adolescents and conduct a rehearsal when you are in full fight or flight mode anyone else have this experience i read several posts on here from people saying that the ssris fixed the depression but not the anxiety i am hoping for more positive results in the long run have a great one,4

does anyone else get so much anxiety from texting i struggle so much with texting people and its something that seems so minor and simple but it brings me so much anxiety i always end up ghosting everyone i text,4
does anyone else have anxiety attacks over small things of repetitive nature like for example i can have a full on attack when my bf picks or pulls at his beard or when someone is tapping their fingers or legs it seems like i get triggered by other peoples coping mechanisms this has been extremely frustrating because my bf has this habit when he is anxious and not even realizing it and its causing my to have attacks and then i am zorped and on edge and he is constantly on edge trying to look out for me we are trying different things like closing doors and both trying to be mindful but i would really like help on how to manage and treat it does anyone else share a similar experience i am also currently in therapy and working on it but she doesnt have any experience with this and am beginning to give up,4
ive spent most of my life craving sympathy and understanding from others hoping someone would notice my struggles and help me but even when people do try to help me i shut down i dont want to burden others with my problems and ik not everyone knows how to comfort someone who is experiencing extreme anxiety or a panic attack but even when i turn down others help i still sit here going wow i wish someone would help me why is no one noticing that im struggling its so stupid and contradicting in my head and i have no clue how to even begin to get over it,4

tldr having very mixed feelings over a reunion that i was not invited to but i feel i should have been plus a former friend who socially traumatized me was invited backstory i am a pro player at a certain game i went viral on youtube and reddit different profile the games official youtube channels video of my gameplay has over m views and is the third mostviewed video on the channel i had worked with the games pr on stuff in the past and was always welcome at events and such i befriended many other players of this game over social media i deactivated facebook in early because i realized my mental health issues were showing and people were leaving group chats because of me and even unfriending me i decided to deactivate before i ruined any friendships that meant a lot to me i still maintain strong friendships with many of my fellow players for many years the makers of the game said that they would never do a tournament or any kind of bring together the best players event because the player base is just too large and because the game is very luckbased but if youre like me you can sort of manipulate your odds this year a new person was put in charge of the game and they have decided to finally have a special event reuniting fan favorite players in person most of whom went viral in the same way i did people were invited and i was not one of them the day the invitations went out i got several messages from fellow players asking me did you get invited to the thing many in the community were shocked i was not and one of them said theyre missing out without you when i found out this was happening i started trembling with anxiety for multiple reasons one being that i was overthinking why i wasnt invited and paranoia that i may be blacklisted i have been very vocal about the games flaws on social media one thing that got me was that around the time my gameplay was posted i was often grouped with two other great players in promotional stuff and we were kind of like the defacto goat trio we were the top three viewed videos on the youtube channel at the time though a couple have snuck between us since then these two people were both invited to the reunion event i am so happy for those who were invited and im trying to convince myself that not everyone could get this opportunity but i cant help but feel hurt and worried the reunion happened today and i purposefully avoided everyones social media so i wouldnt have to see photos or anything of them hanging out at bars or restaurants and stuff afterwards i suffer from fomo big time ive flown out to events that friends went to just to avoid fomo but i didnt have time to fly out for this reunion even to just stop by and say hi the event is not being publicized until may so im going to have to deal with this feeling again in a couple of months part of the reason i am anxious about this whole thing is because one of the players who was invited to the reunion is a former close friend of mine we bonded over the game of course and his high score blew mine out of the water we discovered we had a lot in common he also suffers anxiety and he gave me advice on what meds are better than others i still take the one he recommended me to this day were also both gay and i found him very attractive as did many others in our community our friendship shattered when i went to visit him in person across the country and he showed very manipulative behavior that i was too naive to discern at the time he purposefully distanced himself from me whenever we were in a room together eg sitting on a different couch and excluded me from parties he went to while i was in town to prevent anything sexual happening between us and lying about them he had been sending me several pictures of him shirtless and in bed with other guys we knew knowing it would turn me on among many other forms of leading me on but never had the courage to say i dont like you like that instead he let me come all this way and then gaslit me for trying to come on to him saying it was inappropriate behavior behavior that he exhibited with other guys right in front of me and said its different with them when i asked we tried to move on from that experience while staying friends but then he kept making jokes about me with the other guys and i got tired of it we havent spoken in months and when we did speak it was only because he had a question about the game i suffered so much social trauma from this person i trusted and his group of friends who seemed like a mean girls plastics clique that acted polite around me but i later realized they didnt care about me one way or the other i followed all of them on instagram and only one followed me back these people ostracized and humiliated me on top of my friends various forms of mental and emotional abuse the trauma only started setting in as months passed and i started crying myself to sleep and sort of reenacting the day everything happened in my head wishing i was more assertive now i get ptsd at the mention of his name and i deleted almost every picture i took on my trip to meet him so since he was invited to the reunion i might have declined if i was invited so i wouldnt have to be in the same room as him because it would have been so triggering for me and i would not have been able to concentrate on the game that being said i would definitely be willing to take a day to have a serious discussion with this person over how he made me feel and maybe we could start over strictly as friends because i do think he is a good person i really hope come may when the reunion is made public that i dont suffer any more ptsd i hope i can find some healthy distractions has anyone ever been in a situation like this involving being excluded from an outing involving a traumatic person from your past,4
recently i got a fairly nice gift for a friends birthday worth which isnt an extravagant gift but definitely the nicest gift ive given in this particular friendgroup i was really excited about this gift because i thought it was a good fit for this person unfortunately my excitement for giving this gift turned to anxiety as i became concerned about how such a relatively nice gift might be perceived being given to a friend of the opposite sex i realize this is completely irrational as most of my anxiety is so this became a trigger for a multiweek bout of extremely high anxiety and this person definitely realized that they were the trigger for it one way or another and now it seems like they are at the point that they are starting to get a little freaked out and im afraid of losing one of my closest friends i feel the need to apologize or explain for making them feel so horrible but how can you explain this im afraid that talking to them about it will just make it more awkward our recent interactions have been cold and awkward i dont know what to do now,4

hello after dreading going to a psychiatrist for a couple of months i finally got the courage to do it and this is a big step for me the doctor prescribed me enlift xanax and magnesium which ive heard good things about it in this subreddit ive only ever been prescribed zoloft tried it for about months and it didnt work for me so im basically going in blind the doctor told me some basic instructions as well as explained how they work but it doesnt ease my anxiety about them especially xanax i generally get a lot of anxiety about medications tho not just this kind i know medications like these arent a onesizefitsall but i think it would ease my anxiety to know some of your guys personal experiences with them i think knowing im not alone in this will make it less scary for me especially with the stigma in my country around any medication for mental health edit looked up enlift and it goes by a lot of other names but google says its scientific name is escitalopram if thats of any help,4

nearby i wasnt paying any attention to them i was playing a video game on my dads laptop i had headphones on with one ear uncovered because i was also watching the simpsons so i didnt know what they were talking about my dad came up to me and held out what seemed to be this gummy candy i dont remember if i asked what it was whether i did or not he was just like try it now the thing about my dad is that this sort of thing isnt unusual im used to him making me try weird foods and such so perhaps foolishly i ate it without really questioning it it tasted vile it was only after i had already swallowed it that he told me it was an edible now another thing about him is that a lot of times he likes to mess with me once when i was a teenager for example he gave me a drink and told me it had alcohol when it really didnt so i wasnt sure if he was lying or not i knew he and his wife sometimes took edibles i justdidnt know they had any at the time i had never done drugs before and i dont think i would have eaten it if i had known after that he and his wife went to bed about an hour or so passed then it began kicking in i started feeling dizzy and i got kind of scared so i went into their bedroom and i asked my dad if it really was an edible he said no this was a lie but obviously i didnt know it at the time i decided the best thing to do was try to get some sleep there was only one bedroom so i had been sleeping on a mattress in the corner so i was lying there crying because i had no idea if what i was feeling was because i was high or if it was all in my head my dads wife was also high and she started talking to me i started laughing things got kind of funnyi started talking about all of my interests much to my dads annoyance as he was trying to sleep and i said some really embarrassing things i later found out he had recorded at least most of what i saidwell yelled cause apparently when im high i get really loud i have selective mutism so i tend to have a lot of trouble talking if im not really comfortable its gotten better over the years but my dad is convinced that i dont actually have it or something anyway at some point i fell asleep and had a horrible nightmare its hard to describe but it involved me forgetting everythingmy life my interests the people i knew and the world around mei dreamt that my dad knew i was going to forget it all and i remember the fear i felt in the nightmare just that feeling ofwhy why would he do this to me i tried to recall faces mine my dads a musician i have a crush on yeah weird i knowand everything was warped grotesque everything became a black void you know that scene in spongebob where squidwards in that alone place kind of like that except black instead of white i began thinking that maybe i had died or was dying and that this horrible void was the afterlife i woke up sobbing and screaming oh godoh lord over and over and also yelling at my dad how could you do this to me and i will never forgive you he and his wife got me up from the mattress and had me drink some water everything during this part and afterwards felt like a dream that i was trying to wake up from my dad made me some oatmeal and put on some songs by one of my favorite artists american murder song in my disoriented state i remember thinking that the first song he put on was familiar and that if i could just hang on to that familiar feeling everything would hopefully be okay i vaguely remember singing along to the songs after i ate he put on one of my favorite movies repo the genetic opera and left me in the living room i remember it being on but it felt almost like i was half asleep or something throughout i was just anxious and confused and i was trying to focus on the movie but i kepti dont know it was like going in and out of consciousness or something theres a scene towards the end of the movie where the main character falls unconscious and i remember vaguely wondering if perhaps i was actually her im a guy not that it mattered to my drugged self and that i would wake up and the movie would be reality apparently i also sang along to the whole move but i dont remember this my dad came into the room to check on me at some point and he said i seemed to be having a great time but i know i really wasnt i do remember however that at some point i threw up all over myself after the movie i told my dad i threw up and he was mad that i was too disoriented to clean it up myself by this point about six hours had passed since i had taken the edible i remember being so confused i asked him what day it was after that i went back to sleep the next day my dad told me that it really was an edibleso i did feel somewhat relieved that it was actually a drug that was making me feel that way but for about three days afterward i still felt the affects of itand for about a week or so i kept experience derealization my dads reason for giving me the ediblehe said he thought it would make me talk morewhich it did but it was humiliating apparently he and his wife had talked about what was in it before he gave me the edible but as my cousin pointed out to me its strange to just assume that id be paying attention to a conversation that i wasnt even part of even if i was in the room so he apparently thought i knew what it was i wasnt able to go home immediately he lives in another state so he had to buy a plane ticket and all that but when i eventually did i told my mom what happened shes furious at my dad though neither of us have spoken to him about it i talked to my therapist about it recently but her reaction seemeddismissive like she thought it was cool that it made me talk about my interests but againi had no consent so here i am exactly a month after it happenedi still experience derealization if i think about it parts of the nightmare i mentioned i literally only remembered last night i justi dont know how im going to get over this i dont know if im ever going to be able to for example watch repo againjust recently i listened to one of the songs my dad had put on and it gave me a weird feeling in my stomach im trying to decide whether or not to cut ties with my dadthis isnt the first time ive thought about it to be honest but im seriously considering it now i just know now that thinking about that nightmare still terrifies me,4

yesterday i attended my boyfriends cousins wedding and wore a short creamcolored dress with a black pattern the color literally did not occur to me when i got dressed i picked it because i felt bloated and it was flowy and thats as far as my brain got at the reception my boyfriends mom spilled red wine on my dress as i tried to dab out the stain i caught myself saying see this is why i never wear whiteand then it hit me i spiraled into an anxiety attack and left the reception to go back to my hotel to change i felt like such an asshole such an idiot and i still cant shake that feeling i sat in the secondtolast row at the ceremony at the very end of the row away from the aisle thank god it was a casual wedding people were there in jeans no one said anything to me and it was genuinely an accident a very stupid accident but it was also my first time meeting my boyfriends extended family and im now convinced they all hate me i cant think about anything else i feel like such a fuckup like im a bad person logically i know its not the end of the world i know if that was my biggest asshole move in recent memory im doing ok but i dont feel any of that selfforgiveness seems truly impossible with anxiety sometimes,4

does anyone also feels like this anxiety wont ever go away i m had my first panic attack about months ago and i have never been the same since then im going to therapy and havent been prescribed with meds yet sometimes i feel better than others but the most minimum thing will give me so much anxiety,4
hey i was wondering how often can you get anxiety symptoms hourly once a day once a weak ive been having this issue but my doctors keep telling me is just anxiety and i get this every hour of the days lightheaded extreme hunger shortness of breath vomiting or nausea my arms start to feel light like feathers or a weird feeling not tingling tho hot flashes heart rises etc tho my heart doesnt rise constantly only when my symptoms get bad and i get worried i check my blood sugar and everytime this happens is at mgdl ive told this to my doc but he keeps telling me is just anxiety like i said this happens everyhour all the symptoms everyday for a year now and it doesnt go away until i drink juice or sugary stuff but he said that thats my coping mechanism lol i find out after a long time im insulin resistant but i dont know if this could be the cause what are your symptoms of anxiety,4
by tomorrow night i yo uk university student have to email my dissertation supervisor a draft of what i have written so far the deadline is in may and he wants to give me some feedback before the upcoming easter break but the problem is that i havent written anything at all ive collated dozens of pages of general notes vague ideas and research over the last few months but i dont have a clue what to do with it or where to start ive written probably hundreds of assessments and essays in my life and until a few weeks ago i had not failed a single one of them but a few weeks ago my motivation selfbelief and general ability to work which were all low to begin with anyway just stopped altogether i had deadlines for two course module assessments within a week of each other and i missed both of them for one of the first times in my education i had not only failed with work but i had failed to even complete the work i missed the first one because i had zero interest in knowledge of or care for the subject because i kept procrastinating and because its possible that i have adhd i dont want to know about this but i think i have it i missed the second one because of the same reasons and because i failed the first one so it didnt make a difference if i missed the second one since i got the email last week from my supervisor that i have to send him whatever ive been working on by tomorrow tuesday ive not only not been working on the dissertation but ive detached myself from it almost completely i dont like thinking about it i keep distracting myself from it literally and mentally because i dont want to do it the subject itself interests me it was my choice after all and ive done a lot of research too much i think and every time i ever doubt my work ability like this which is every time ive ever done an assessment in my three years at university it usually turns out alright but i cant see how this one of course the most important one will end in anything other than failure so ive come all this way from the start of uni three years ago from the start of reception years ago and ive always at the very least managed to succeed but now of all times is when it stops im aware that every student who has ever tried to write a university thesis has had these doubts at some time or a lot of the time but that makes me feel all the more incapable because those students have all and will all get through it and i know that i wont i look around the university library that im currently writing this in and all i see is people working theyre focused selfdisciplined and content to be here but im not one of them i know that i dont belong here and i dont like it here i really dont like coming here but i come here nevertheless im sitting here wasting more time on something that i dont have to do that i shouldnt be doing but im doing nevertheless because i think a part of me actually wants to fail i dont know why anyone would want that especially me ive always feared failure the confirmation of it by my university and parents the consequences of it practically and emotionally and thats whats driven me to always succeed with my work in education ive only ever done that work because i fear the consequences of not doing it i do it because i have to never because i wanted to ive always been like this so why am i here then if you never enjoyed school or college which i didnt then why did you actively decide to go to university hmm maybe because i thought i had to not because i wanted to pursue a career i have absolutely no ambition at all and it was partly because the idea of getting a job after i left college at seemed completely impossible ive suffered from social anxiety for most of my life the basics of social interaction are overwhelming to me but mostly it was because i didnt think any of it through i didnt want to think it through at all my parents thought i could maybe go to this university so i just said okay i didnt even look into the university at all and i didnt consider any others the reason that i do this is because i hate thinking about the future short medium and long term whenever people ask me about the future whether its where do you see yourself in five years what do you want to do with your life or even simply do you have any plans for the weekend ive always given vague nonanswers ive been like this forever probably because ive been bombarded with these questions from career advisors since year but its also because the future is too uncertain and complicated it scares me to think about the future in any sort of way so i dont and now im paying the price and the future gets closer every day and i wish i could go back in time maybe to live things differently maybe to live them the same i think about the past my childhood especially every day and every single night i dream about the past too the other day i had one about the last day of year ive had hundreds like it all about the last day of secondary school the thing that haunts me about it is the fact that i dont remember what happened all i remember is that i never saw any of my peers again after that day because i made the conscious decision to leave them and go to a different college every single dream i have involves my old school friends every one in case it isnt clear my recent doubts over starting let alone completing or succeeding with my dissertation are related to so many other things that i have consciously often deliberately bottled up over the years and it is years i know how unhealthy and dangerous it is to do this but i do it anyway because its easier and because its been the default way of accepting contemplating and processing my emotions for as long as i can remember ive never had the desire to tell anyone including family about my most vulnerable thoughts and feelings fears and insecurities becausewellwhere to start fear of judgement fear of being misunderstood fear of being understood fear of the literal and emotional consequences on myself and on my relationships the fact that emotions were and are are never discussed in my family or in the few social circles i used to have note havent had friends for five years i bottle all of this up and ill continue to but it feels like the bottle is starting to overflow if anyone has read this far you might as well consider yourself the first person who has ever heard anything that is even remotely as private as what ive just revealed in these last few paragraphs and if youve read this far and if you are a healthy normal person you will have obviously thought to yourself yeah he needs therapy but i dont think i do and i certainly dont want to theres a small part of me that desires to let it all out i could write a book about all of my problems but i know that would be a terrifying and draining experience even if it leads to something better and the desire certainly isnt big enough for me to have serious thoughts about seeking helpfrom anyone in fact i think thats the bottomline regardless of whether i need help or guidance or advice or support or sympathy i dont think i want it not enough anyway i think id hate myself for seeking it out because id feel like a desperately sad narcissist i know im pathetic dumb probably annoying an embarrassment a failure a waste of space time money and effort but i dont think im a narcissist and i know that people who seek help arent narcissistic but i would think that i am if i did so i dont and ive never sought help from anyone not only the serious personal stuff but the little trivial specific things too is it because of a deeprooted social anxiety and my complete lack of social confidence ability and experience yes but like with my other anxieties that i probably need help with health anxiety fear of the future fear of the passage of time the fear of failure the fear of work the fear of my dissertation i dont care about help or support or selfimprovement i dont want any of it because i think it wont work for me or that it doesnt apply to me i dont want to be helped and yet here i am writing this,4
just a vent tbh ive suffered from anxiety my whole life and as i grow older i feel my anxiety getting progressively worse instead of better ironically even therapy scares me as im not really one to open up in front of others in fear of burdeningboring them sounds silly but i almost feel embarrassed paying someone to help me who otherwise wouldnt give me a second thought on the topic of skills i wholeheartedly believe i have skills ive always been told im smart but no one sees how much time and struggle goes behind good grades when im honest about not being intelligent understandably people think im fishing for compliments even then i think i just got lucky with good questions and random guesses literally no achievement i think i really deserved and was more abt the odds being in my favour its all due to subliminals and manifestation rather than talent as well my social skills are horrendous im so awkward w people and can barely keep a convo going with those close to me i rely on them to start and keep convos going cause im just so boring and unfunny i have an extremely hard time communicating with males too idk i completely stiffen up and come across so awkward i like art but again im not talented at it despite so much practice and was rejected from an art school unsurprisingly im learning to drive and after lessons i still cant move a car without sweating buckets shaking and struggling to control it even moving off is so challenging im expecting to waste a ton of money due to my incompetence at understanding basic instructions and crippling fear im bad at sports games mediocre at cooking and just about everything ive tried heck i cant even ride a bike i couldnt list a single talent i have anything im half decent at is a result of x the effort generally needed for example im currently writing an essay thats taken me all day to understand and plan when it was only meant to be an hour task there just doesnt seem to be anything redeemable for me my anxiety has made me become more and more closed off from people i will sit in toilets at school in fear of being looked at i never contribute to class in fear of being wrong i sit on the bus with my hood on so im not looked at even when i briefly had a job i couldnt work out the basics that everyone learnt in a day it was very telling that this incompetence wasnt only reflecting in school but other places sweating is one of the main symptoms i experience and its created deep rooted insecurities for me i can stay somewhat in peace at home but i do have struggles here and there but obviously its not practical to rely on home for peace as i fear i will completely isolate myself this way does anyone have a similar situation,4
i have pretty bad health anxiety that developed after trauma months ago i meditate utilize deep breathing exercises run and read inspirational quotes and seeing a trauma therapist when i feel pain its a huge trigger for me i tried zoloft and had a horrible reaction im on the fence about taking busbar or lexapro any suggestions what worked for you with a similar experience zoloft i literally slept hours max for weeks straight needing some advice from you guys this is all new for me thank you for listening,4
hey yall im a guy who has felt anxiety all his life it used to be so bad id wake up every morning and throw up because i always felt anxious to start the day that has went away now although i still feel anxiety especially when i drink high caffeine drinks but im kinda used to it i believe energy drinks and strong coffee has made me get comfortable with that anxious feeling as well as the fromsoftware games id attribute helping me deal with feelings of dread and dispair i am at the point where i can quell my anxiety fairly easy i still feel those feelings of anxiousness and dread but i am now comfortable with them,4
long story short im dealing with mental health for years now and for the last six months or so i have almost every day a panic attack since waking till evening i see a psychiatrist and psychologist and recently started a new job i know i have my issues but cant wrap my head around having so much anxiety its net getting better or easier with time usually when im in peak anxiety i go on a few hours listening to music and crying in a dark room bender while smoking to much in the process i do meditation a trying to walk hours a day but i fucking hate sports and im lazy thank you i felt the need to vent sorry for shitty english,4
i want to cancel even though i logically know itll be good for me edit it went well i feel better mentally my friend and i also planned to walk twice this week,4
for example i really want to walk k steps a day and reduce the amount of coffeecaffeine i drink just curious to see what others are doing because sometimes its hard for me to see the smallsimple things that can help with anxiety,4
i was having a conversation with a close friend of mine about work settings because i will be having an internship soon we talked about standard work things and tips but then it lead to talking about my anxiety i asked if im unable to speak because of anxiety how do i communicate that to them them being my coworkers for extra context i think this is a common thing but just in case my throat closes up to a degree that it becomes hard to and painful to breathe or speak obviously i need to breathe so ive learned to tough through it and even so i was able to get an appointment with someone who may be able to help this issue as for speaking that can be even more painful than breathing so i usually try to tap my throat with my finger and hold up one finger with the other hand to try to communicate that i need a minute and i cant breathespeak i was worried that may not be enough and i had previously told my friend about my issues i figured hed be the right guy to ask especially since hes training to become a therapist i guessed he may have some ideas i havent thought about yet he told me to tell my coworkers i need a minute to think and to maybe say it directly i asked him if i cant talk how do i say it to them directly im bad with conveying tone partially because im autistic so i can see in hindsight that it may have come off wrong he asked me if i was just going to leave or stay quiet without telling them what was going on and he also said that the situation would just become worse i was starting to get a bit upset and i said that i knew that then he told me to learn how to force myself to say it thats where i became really upset i have no idea if this was justified or not all i know is how much it hurt i tired my best to remind him of some of my tics and how if im stressed enough to be unable to speak forcing myself would definately make the situation worse i told him about how theres been times where ive gotten overwhelmed and anxious which led to me accidently hitting someone rarely or most commonly myself sometimes ill have really bad ones which make me yell fling my arm beside my head or slam a fist down on a table i then apologized he then told me that its unfair but i have to vocalize that kind of thing i worked some things out with another close friend of mine and we both agreed that i should maybe carry around some laminated cards on a ring with common words and sayings to help me communicate we also talked about telling my coworkers and employers beforehand about my issues and how i need a few minutes to myself to calm down i tried messaging the friend from before saying that i wanted to talk i apologized for getting upset and explained that i was hurt by what he said and that i was hoping we can talk about it all i apologized again ive seen hes read the message but he hasnt responded im a bit worried but trying to be patient with out differing time zones should i force myself to talk when i am unable to especially with some of my issues i want to believe im not at fault but i feel horrible about getting upset and im wondering if hes right and i should just try to suck it up edit i also worry that i may have overreacted and blown up over something unimportant its just so infuriating and hurtful because ive been told all my life to force myself to do things and to just toughen up and deal with it ive been called overly emotional and at this point any slight indication someone thinks that way kind of sets me off im sorry if this doesnt make much sense i struggle putting these things into words,4
my dad had a heart attack days back and now has a neuro complication a surgery has been done but he is very week he wishes to talk but he has ventilator tubes and nasal tube for food everything happened very suddently he doesnt even know what is happening i cant look at him like this my heart is crying for him i feel very anxious on whats going to happen how will he recover my overthinking is not helping me but at the same time i know i should not be emotional as that would affect my health and might not be able to help him better please could you advise how can i keep my emotions aside i love my father a lot cant see him like this alone in the icu comfused on what is happening around him he must be so scared just typing this makes me cry please help i wish to stay strong and help him,4
it happened to me the three times i was on antideps i would just feel like i was not caring about what was going on around me if an old lady fell i could just not be bothered to help like all empathy gone it would then all come back with the anxiety,4
it seems to get worse i live in a rural town overseas from my home country of australia just some background info i have thoughts because there are little places to go that im wasting my time and im usually in my room all day thinking watching tv or sleeping i have thoughts that im not being productive and that there arent many things i could do to be productive this is what concerns me most im doing a degree and thats the only productive thing im doing i feel trapped in a boring lifestyle and im also living with my parents ive contemplated moving back to australia but then i would have to go on a job hunt its still an option,4
my ex hasnt responded to me in days we are still friends and this really isnt like him and im starting to get really worried i owed him and i asked him if he got it no response i sent him a picture of my new pc setup nothing last time we called was a couple days ago and he said that he would call me back because he had to go to class but he never did i tried calling him just now but to no response idk if im overreacting but im close to tears like what if something happened or did he just ghost me im so dizzy from panicking so much help,4
well i know that the best way to reduce it is to not drink at all but u know there is times u dont wanna miss i saw that my anxiety levels goes up the days after i drink but i believe that there is things u can do to reduce that effects whats ur propositions,4
does anyone else feel overwhelming anxiety when it comes to responding to emails at work i work in a large corporate environment and whenever i get emails directed at me or regarding tasks related to me especially direct asks my anxiety skyrockets it normally becomes quite difficult then to respond in a timely manner that would be coherent so my responses become staggered over hours even then i end up rereading and rereading my responses before i send them so my question is how do you cope with anxiety in the workplace it has become quite overwhelming for me recently and i am unsure what to do to cope,4
i feel so anxious scared alone broken i feel gross and ugly and unwanted i feel like i have no one to talk to im so sad,4
i am coming off mirtazapene which i cant spell i was on mg and went down to mg i am now taking mg every other day is taking mg every other day the same as taking mg a day would i be better to cut my pills in half and take mg a day i plan to stay on this dose for a few more weeks then stop taking any,4
what does it feel like for you for me it feels like a buzzing or vibration in my chest head and teeth everything is way too much and i get goosebumps on my forehead,4
hi recently my psychiatrist replaced my old meds with clozapine ive been feeling quite bad with it and she refuses to change it as far as i know it isnt used a lot to treat anxiety andor depressionmy only two diagnosis id want to know your experiences with it or if my silly psychiatrist is messing up,4
i probably bit off more than i can chew but its the only way i can financially survive i am a full time student and work hours a week and i am in the army ng not to mention i have also moved a lot recently and my few off days are spent running errands or appointments due to this there have been several times i log into my classes and see that i just missed the deadline for an assignment this has happened a few times and i am devastated each time as all the professors refuse any late work or makeups now i nearly have a panic attack each time i log into my classes but i also need to do it kinda just getting that off my chest but will also take advice,4
hi anxious friends i recently switched my meds from effexor to prozac and added buspirone mg for anxiety my doctor told me to take it as needed but after all the research ive done this doesnt make sense to me how would it even be effective if i only took it as needed if its not a fastimmediate acting drug it builds up in your system over time right so id need to take it consistently for a long period of time to feel any effects ill ask my doctor too of course but im very interested in other peoples experiences with buspirone specifically and whether you took it as needed or daily ive been taking mg x a day for about a month with some missed doses in between and i do feel less anxious but the way my doctor described it made it sound like it was a fast acting anti anxiety drug that calms you down after you take a dose rather than one that builds in your system over time if it matters i also take concerta and bupropion thanks friends,4
i already have terrible anxiety iv struggled with addiction and whatnot in the past and now i have to have surgery in a few days someone ran into me at work could of been alot worse but i got away from a forklift with a busted up lower leg bone and alot of pain and brushes now that the shock wore off and im thinking about it idk if i can do it i wanna hide and disapear i got like hours and its agonizing i dont wanna deal with this shit i already been in pain for weeks and now its gonna be so much worse i know alot of people have way more serious issues and i ought not complain but dang my chest has been tight for way too long idk guess im just venting why did i stop waiting tables and decide to work around unsafe people and heavy machines,4
i dont know why but i feel pressure and pain i am unable to live and nothing works i beg someone to help me,4
how long can i potentially expect the brain fog and cognitive adjustments from going from mg to mg of trintellix im weeks right now and still the same,4
i am in another city away from all of my friends i have developed this fear of abandoment i feel like they will start to dislike me for whatever reason i dont often interact with all of them by person on chats because we have big chat groups i am bad at conversations one to one but i do my best to do small talks i feel like they will consider me not a good friend for this i try to check up on them but idk i guess i fear that in time they will find me annoying and think that it is a one sidedfriendship how can i reduce my anxiety about this i feel like our connection is blurring i love them but i dont want them to think that i dont care about them,4
anyone have luck with it im thinking of asking my psych about it since its not habit forming like other anxiety meds my anxiety is controlling my life and im desperate for something to help,4
and then i get insecure from that my voice is shaking so i get more anxious has anyone tips on how to control your voice i also have a moderate stutter so that isnt helping too,4

am a yearold college student trying to make the best of my life despite my past growing up i had a difficult childhood my father and stepfather were both abusive and would often beat me up for the smallest reasons i remember hiding in my room and praying that they would leave me alone but it never worked my mom was an alcoholic and she never showed me any love or affection she was always too drunk to care about anything that was going on in my life i felt like i was all alone in the world and i had no one to turn to as a result of my childhood i developed a deep sense of trust issues i find it hard to open up to people and let them in i am constantly afraid that they will hurt me in some way just like my father and stepfather did but despite all of this i refuse to let my past define me i am determined to make something of myself and create a better life for me college has been a fresh start for me and i have made some friends who seem to genuinely care about me however even with my newfound friendships i still find it hard to trust people i am always on guard and keep people at arms length afraid that they will hurt me like my father and stepfather did sometimes i wish i could forget about my past and start anew but its always there in the back of my mind haunting me its hard to let go of the pain and the memories that shaped me into the person i am today but i refuse to let my past hold me back i am determined to overcome my trust issues and build a better future for myself,4
so last week i have bad intrusive thoughts about my boyfriend doing bad things to me like really bad im scared that i dont become scared of him the worst part is that when i look at him i have that voice in my head that say your bf is bad and deep down i really know he would never do things like that to me but at the same time feels so real am i going crazy,4
so based on therapy i read the drama of the gifted child and it blew my mind how many things it described that i used to think were just quirky about my parent and then nailed ways it may have affected my emotions its not an easy path to process but has anyone else come to late in life conclusions that their parent is likely borderline and that this is a direct connection to their own anxiety,4
i thought i was having a good day but i guess not i was driving to school and started getting such bad panicky feeling on the freeway im all the way in another city now pulled into a parking lot i just wanna go home im so nervous and i dont even know why i just really need help right now,4
the last job i had was back in october doing lowskilled it work at a hospital and i got fired worked there two months the longest ive ever held a job im in my early s and its embarrassing to admit that but its true i cant keep a job i either quit after a short while or in this instance get chucked out ampxb since then ive avoided work all together as all i feel is bitterness and shame another deterrent is how im not good at anything in particular all i can get are shit jobs where im completely replaceable ampxb im too shy and anxious all the time so talking to people is really hard when i worked at a cinema it wasnt too bad because there were people my age and i felt good talking to them but that job went to pieces because management hated me long story ampxb im told to get a skill but the idea of getting a trade sounds harrowing to me as ive worked on construction sites and the people who work there are usually abrasive cokeheads who i really wouldnt get along withtolerate ampxb all ive done for the past year is read write listen to music and occasionally socialise but im pretty much alone now i guess when youre socially isolated its hard to really know yourself like you cant test yourself much in a public setting so its hard to truly know who you are i find it hard sometimes just thinking about what jobs would suit me it seems impossible i know what i dont want to do but thats pretty much everything to be honest the idea of working a job again commuting forcing myself to speak to people who i dont want to be around and doing these mundane things feels like death isnt so bad considering the sort of jobs i can get which are garbage service jobs or lowskilled office ones with high turnovers ampxb so im stuck i feel really trapped the job centre is harassing me and i hate going in there as i feel like such a lowlife but on the same token i can barely afford the upkeeps for my car so ill have to work some shit job soon i suppose ampxb im not on medication or anything i feel embarrassed typing this out im scared of telling anyone my problems as i was always told theyre insignificant and i should man up even though the same people who told me that complain and talk about how bad their lives are all the time to me and never ask about how im doing so whatever seeing a gp in this country is a joke anyway so theres zero point trying to get help anyways i tried to be ambitious and maybe move countries but i dont even have any qualifications like i dont have a degree so my options are very limited id love to move countries and just forget about how bad my life sucks here but i cant do that regrettably so i guess ill have to accept my lot in life working these miserable hapless jobs until i eventually murder myself or go crazy,4
i dont know why my brain is the way it is anymore and it hurts im struggling so much heres my story if you want to stick around to read it last year about this same time i got covid probably the worst thing i have ever gone through in my entire life besides the horrible sickness part somehow it sparked some sort of new anxiety in me before it i never experienced anxiety like i do now but somehow it came on painfully out of no where panic attacks more than once a day unable to control my thoughts horrible intrusive thoughts nightmares insomnia constant fidgeting amp some angerirritability for no reason at all after a month or two from healing from covid covid long haul i was getting better no more panic attacks able to drive get out and be happy i was okay till now one night i woke up a little too early so i decided to stay up instead of falling back asleep for three or so hours and boom it was back my mind went straight back to the anxiety the irritability and pain as before but without the anxiety its been a few weeks or so now since it started and i feel so tired and mentally drained i started some anxiety meds buspirone mg x and havent seen a massive amount of change yet advice help do i just give up,4
i often see people posting on here is a symptom of anxiety the answer is outta a hundred yes my anxiety has given me the weirdest aches amp pains fron a non stop fluttering eye to hot or cold sweats pins amp needles stabbing pains all the way to i cant breathe or feeling im about to die of a heart attack or the old this isnt real life when are brains are overloaded with stress hormones it goes berserk as ive learned to accept my symptoms as a part of my anxiety amp not fight or repress them its alot easier to manageanxiety will not kill me is my mantra i know its hard but dont hold on to every little feeling in your body it only magnify the feeling my anxiety is more mental now when it comes which while tricky is infinitely easier then feeling im gonna die times a day whats your weirdest or scariest symptom lets normalise the abnormal amp all feel a bit better,4
how do i tell if its my anxietystress causing my heart palpitations or if i have an actual heart problem brief background changed my ssri back in november bad idea didnt suit me at all sent me into a depression rut amp only just started back on my old meds again starting to climb out of this rut now however i still get bad palpitations onoff when im feeling anxiousstressed but sometimes i can just be lying in bed or walking around amp get them when i dont feel any anxiety present once i get them it triggers my anxiety because i fear something is awfully wrong amp that ill have a heart attack etc i definitely have cardiophobia amp im always fixated on my heart convinced something is wrong i had my bloods done last week amp they were fine amp tomorrow i get an ecg but im scared if i have afib or arrhythmia issues they wont pick it up because ive heard they are difficult to detect from an outsider looking in do you think i have a real heart problem or do you think my palpitations are all anxietystress related,4
i just started on lexapro mg days ago i have severe gad and ocd and its causing me extreme distress i also have my wedding on april th im afraid it will make me a zombie as well as cause sexual performance issues and i dont want to be emotionless on my wedding day or unable to have sex on my honeymoon so im stuck between a rock and a hard place from your experience have any of you noticed a significant difference in emotion and or sexual performance while on mg,4
so first off i apologize for the millionth post about has anyone felt like this been struggling to post anything for that reason ive been having really bad anxiety these past months my dad passed away in december and i had to put my dog down a week ago so i definitely think this has affected my greatly ive never felt this bad for this long been waking up most days shakey and nervous most days im worrying about my health and cant seem to shake off intrusive thoughts i went to the doctor on thursday and was told my blood pressure was high which made me more anxious was precribed some for blood pressure and sertraline for the anxiety today ive been feeling dizzy it comes and goes and just loosing interest in normal things just a general feeling of feeling off or not all here also cant seem to swallow very well im starting to exercise more and eating healthier im hoping to see if anyone has any words of encouragement or has had a similar experience as mine also anyone taking sertraline has any side effects anything would help rn thank you edit side note last night i took a chocolate piece which had cbd and a strand of thc to help me sleep it made me feel slow and like i wasnt fully there and gave me really bad dry mouth feeling idk if maybe im still feeling those symptoms because still feel out of it and my throat feels like i have something stuck there,4
i sadly developed mild agoraphobia cause of this,4
i really dont want to go to this funeral its my friends aunt who sadly passed suddenly my friend spoke a lot about her but ive never met her so i feel weird going to this funeral my friend is kind of expecting me to pay my respects and i dont know how to tell her that i cant go am i letting my anxiety get the better of me by not going or is it reasonable not to go to this funeral for context ive known my friend since high school and were both in out early s and im reasonably close to her edit i did go and it was fine and it made her happy so in the end im glad i did something good,4
m as a bit of background i am currently in therapy for anxiety depression ocd and for the last six weeks i have been on mg of sertraline a day and lots of mg promethazine a day since yesterday morning i havent felt great but i atleast thought that the medication was working was feeling depressed a bit the night before but something was drastically different i woke up and felt like i was incoherent but i wasnt and began to feel very depressed i put it down to just a bad day and i read online sertraline can cause depressive feelings i continued on with my day not worrying until the nighttime just before i was going to get into bed something didnt feel right i started to feel strange in ways i cant describe and i had these second headaches in the same spot every minutes my memory then began to feel weird and i checked my blood pressure which was normal i then grabbed my playstation controller and headset and put it by my bedside which i never do i always leave it on my desk this freaked me out but then again that could just be down to tiredness i got into bed and checked by blood pressure again all normal but something didnt feel right at all it felt like i was living in yesterday and then i suddenly got this strange feeling and this is the best way of describing it it felt like i wasnt conscious but i was at the same time like to recall my memory it feels like none of that happened except it did the world felt deaf and it felt like time was no longer linear i felt as if i couldnt process things properly if at all and thought brain bleed i then went to the bathroom and felt panicked but didnt show it i checked my pupils and they were fine i then went back to my bedroom and began to text people ok reddit for advice and said it all sounds like anxiety at this point my brain was telling me that i was forgetting something but i dont know what because thats the whole point of forgetting something i began to feel like i was in a delirious state and i felt as if i couldnt hang on to a thought process i was worried as this was not normal for me so i woke up my dad and told him what was happening at this point when i was trying to read something i searched up on google the words looked jumbled and i had to read it again this has never been an issue before and i certainly dont have dyslexia so this made me worry i explained to my dad that the way i was feeling was not normal so i asked him if i could call urgent care number i explained to them my situation and i was put on call later to a man who literally asked my father what he thought he should do if i was feeling delirious at this point i realised it was pointless he basically said it sounds like nothing physically but i disagreed exhausted of all my options i decided to go to sleep i got around hours and slept straight through and had vivid detailed dreams i woke up around am after going to bed around am i still had memory troubles but not nearly as bad as the night before i tried to convince myself i was fine and realised i still felt strange and the letters looked a bit jumbled still ive tried to brush it off all day but still feeling weird a recent feeling in the past hours ive attained is the feeling like im waking up and suddenly realising im doing something while im doing it subconsciously but if i backtrack and i try to remember it all feels fine just not in the moment this is the thing that is freaking me out any advice please any at all does this sound like a brain bleed mental confusiondelirium or could this be explained by anxiety derealization tiredness so scared honestly dont know what to do,4

whenever the anxiety isnt heightened im able to enjoy my life im proud of myself and my accomplishments im surrounded by people i love and who love me im excited with where my career is going i have a great life but i feel so intensely anxious that it affects everything the physical symptoms ancillary feelings of depression ocd tendencies i wish i could just let all of that go and enjoy my life to the fullest ive been in therapy for a long time but never tried meds im nervous to start but thinking more and more that its a good option,4
so in the space of months ive gone from one of the most confident people youd ever meet into a shell of myself due to health anxiety i was having quite bad headaches so the doctor after saying tension headaches advised it may be sinusitis i have stopped and started antibiotics had two days then stopped times over the last few months due to then worrying about various things however i have sinus pains and reoccurring sinusear symptoms that keep coming back im feeling tired all the time and just am feeling worse and worse my worry has always been what if its not a bacterial infection vs if it is i guess i just want to see if its worth letting my body try to fight this off despite how ill im feeling or if i should do a full dose of the doxycycline i have been given i just worry about the damage i may already have done to my body and if my body even needs the antibiotics its so hard when you keep feeling more ill everyday but you dont know the right path to go down,4

im almost so my life is nearly half over and i feel like ive done nothing with it especially because for some stupid reason ive placed all my eggs in one basket and insisted on becoming a successful author no matter how stupid or hard or impossible it is to do that these days i havent even tried to date anyone in over years so though id like a relationship im socially inept and awkward i also have a lot of baggage not just from an abusive father but from two abusive relationships i was stupid enough to get into at my age with my history no one wants to even attempt to deal with that nonsense and as i said im inept at socializing because of my own problems i dont have a career like my siblings i dont have a family i dont even have a job because of a permanent disability making it almost impossible for me to work though i have written several novels they more than likely will never see anything resembling profit or commercial success most of my days are spent playing video games hating my life and writing because im too stubborn to give up on that dream despite every single sign telling me that im old its over and theres no way im talented enough to make it work i know that people will say that i shouldnt measure my success by other people or people around me but let me tell you its exceedingly hard to show up to family functions when all your siblings are married professionals with their own houses and you are the loser who has been single for years because she cant manage to get into a relationship thats not abusive and would prefer to stay at home alone with her cat whos gonna die soon anyway because hes old if you want to suggest therapy or medicationive done both medication isnt a fix for me and ive tried it on and off for years therapy has been a constant in my life since i was so if you can possibly imagine it i was far worse than this before now if anything i could possibly say its a miracle that ive come as far as i have with recovering from abuse dealing with addiction an eating disorder and my anxiety issues yet at the same time i desire things that im sure i can never have and i know im running out of time is there any way to cope with the fact that my life just isnt going to get fixed and im pretty much doomed to waiting the clock out for the next years if im somehow lucky enough not to get cancer or some other terrible disease,4
possible emetophobia amp coprophobia triggers i dont typically share on here and im unfamiliar with reddit but my partner suggested i give it a go i experienced something this morning and i believe it to be related to my anxiety i woke up and started completing my typically morning routine all was well i came to the end of the list of things i have to do in my head i left very sick to my stomach ive been trying to become more aware of my anxiety symptoms and have noticed they often show as tummy issues typically physical both feeling like i need to vomit and poop my pants i ran to the bathroom and vomited i had to reach out to my boss and explain the situation i woke with children i was also informed and asked about my colleague whom i work with directly they were possibly going to be out for the day as well causing a staffing issue i feel guilty and a lot of other emotions about the situation it feels like i let my team down i also have a tendency to think and help others without thinking about myself in the process the ultimate people pleaser i was just hoping someone out there in the universe experiences anything similar to me if so i appreciate you thank you for taking the time to read id love to chat,4

as title does anxiety cause faintness when standing tingeling arms have to sit down,4
does anyone else have this or something similar what do u do to help it even if my heart isnt going fast it is pumping like i can feel it in my chest in pretty much my entire body doesnt matter if im sitting down or standing up it is beating hard even when not going fast,4
hi all long time anxiety sufferer first time poster i am diagnosed bipolar with generalized anxiety disorder due to a history of substance abuse i cannot take benzos which severely hinders my ability to be treated with medicine knowing that background i have severe travel anxiety tomorrow i have to travel to nyc from ct which is a literal train ride plus the subway to get downtown and i am in a panic part of it is leaving my baby for the first time since i had him months ago but a bigger part is that i just hate traveling the crowds the unknown the potential of getting lost it all sends me in a tailspin does anyone have any tips to ease me a bit ive already mapped out my route and gone over and over it ive thought of alternatives uber taxis if the subway feels to overwhelming what else can i do,4
does anyone else get this recently i watched a tv show and have become a bit obsessed with it and the relationship between the main characters both in the show and in real life its not even a romantic relationship its a fatherdaughter type and i have a good relationship with my dad so im not sure where the feelings are coming from but i cant shake them i keep thinking about the show and how good it was and how beautiful their relationship is and then my social medias keep showing me edits and clips from interviews etc that just make me more interested but i always end up feeling sad after because im not a part of it at least i think thats what the feeling is im wondering if anyone else has felt like this and how you explain it or what you did to move on or look at it in a more positive way im tired of feeling sad,4
how do you get anything done with anxiety i can keep up the house with kids and adults however it is quite overwhelming how does everyone discipline themselves to follow a list or take time for self care im in a constant state of this should be easier and i should be doing better my thoughts are so negative and mean to myself thanks for any and all suggestions,4
